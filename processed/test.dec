Cameron.
I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
But
You always been this selfish?
The "real you".
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
You might wanna think about it
All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
What's normal?
Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
And where're you going?
It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going --
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
Just sent 'em through.
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
Her favorite uncle
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
She's partial to Joey, not me
Get her to act like a human
Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
William would never have gone to a state school.
Neither has his heterosexuality.
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
Hi
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
Why 're you doing this?
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
So what's your excuse?
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
What?
Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story.
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
I thought you were punishing me.
No, Daddy.
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Yeah.  I guess.
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
Yeah.
No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
We'll all go crazy...
The Judgment is ours!
Are we going to argue?
I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
Appointment to what?
You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
No?
... for a commoner?
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
Call them.
All of them created by people like me.
Chief knows.
Thousands.
You did the same to your God!
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
I knew you would.
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
I was all of these.
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Back in the Czech Republic?
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
Somewhere else?
So you were never a prostitute?
I'll make some for us.
Daphne, I...
C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
You do that, wiseguy.  Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does.
What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.
Stay with her.
Describe him.
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
Watch the news?
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
Who says she's a suspect?
I'll call it... tails.
I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
I kill someone famous.
Good - be tough to the end.  Actor who plays you will want to die like hero.
We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
Yeah.
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
Get down on your knees.
I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
You said speak Czech!
Don't want to film this?
Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.
Evidence.  Of a homicide.
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
Maybe you can be his stand-in.
Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
We're in negotiations, that's correct.
I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
Right. Just a sec.
What's up?
Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.
Anyway, it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
And don't you worry about it.
Where is Mrs. Brown?
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Fortunately, they did.
Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened?
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
That's true.
Roger.
Hal, check all airlock doors secure.
You got a real big mouth, convict.
I ain't tired yet.
No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is.  I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will.  He owes me money...
Would you guys...
He can live or die ... You let us in and he's got a chance to make it.  Otherwise, he gets ventilated.
In the back.  Down the other corridor.
Didn't work out that way.  He busted out with a big Indian. They capped two guards on a road gang. Nice meeting you Reggie.
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
Thank you.
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
You need five years training to handle a joint like...
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
No way...
Hello. And goodbye.
You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
What's wrong with that?
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
Hey, you know what I really think?
Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
Yeah, one of my favorites.
No wonder you're so popular.
Hiya, kid.
We got a lot to talk about.
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
Try and take it.
I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
Ah, Father... You are so wrong. Let me explain...
No thank you.
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
How do I look?
Uh... at least fifty.
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
We got to find the leader. Mangalores don't fight without a leader.
Fuck it! Hold tight!
I'm not going.
Cornelius..
You noticed..
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
I want to sleep... forever...
Recommendations.
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..
No... not at all.  Where are you?
Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ?
Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
I love you.
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
I don't know what to say
You're killing me...
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
I promised him to Machine.
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
Well, well, I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the money as a deposit?  Very good.
Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?
Look, I don't know what this...
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.
How'd you find me here?
Who is Machine?
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
Something like that.
Why?
Nobody saw you bring her in?
Stop talking.
Don't think I won't.
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
Look, you cocksucker...
Of what sort?
Shut up.
Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
I'll risk it.
From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight.
I don't know, where are yours?
Specialty product.
You're learning.
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
You are highly recommended.  Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality.
He succeeded.
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
You don't have any other choice.
You've found missing persons before.
Okay.
You told me to look, so I looked.
Fine...
Well, I'm following up on your daughter, Mary, height; five four, weight; hundred ten pounds, brown eyes, blonde hair.  Born April 24, 1976.  Missing June 11th, 1992.  A runaway, that's how she's listed. Is this information correct... ?
No.
I didn't mean to...
My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
It's been six years.
What am I supposed to do?  Forget her?  Time heals all wounds, right?  She's all I think about, and I've learned to live with that.  But, you want the truth... the real truth? If I had a choice... if I had to choose, between her being out there, living a good life and being happy, and me not knowing; never finding out what happened to her...  ... or her being dead and me knowing...  I'd choose to know.
Who is this... ?
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
No...
What?
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
Then you saw him, too?
You're his sister, right?
I know.  Uh...Alice.
Kristen's story really got to her.
The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.
She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
About Freddy?
Honey, we went over this in therapy.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
It's no story.  It happened.  Freddy's real and he's back.
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
It's okay, Dan
I could tell you were sad.  I just wanted to see if you were all right.
Who said I...wait, what?
I know.
It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
It's just across the park.
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
Krueger is reality.
Mark!
She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.
Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
Reef and I can take the Explorer down, clamp it around the eye, and ---
Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F
What???
We hope!
Yes, Griff?
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
Who with?
I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study.  We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.'
Toward the Pole!
He's a Selectman. The town. He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office. I'm supposed to pull the CB and police light out of your car. They're town property.
I plan to. Soon.
This spring.
Yes.
Shit! What are we gonna do?
If you get it?
Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
What happened?
Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems. 
Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
I guess they're stupid.
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
What do you want, then?
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
Twombley, Jesus. We got to get moving: I got to get up there. How would I know? C'mon, you drive. We'll take my truck.
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
Yeah. A few things.
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
You and Mel Gordon?
I know who it is.
Mel Gordon.
I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
You knew me as a kid.
Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
Is...? She's dead then?
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
This town sucks.
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go.
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
Nah-nah-naw! You done done finally done it! Like a man done it. Done it right. I love you, you mean sonofabitch!
Bang!
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
No, not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm calling because I need you to listen. You're supposed to be a smart guy. You're a professor. I got this theory. Jack says he didn't see Twombley shot but he did.
Then who shot him?
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
That's what you think.
That's not really the point.
Hey, you guys back already?
Alice... I...
Been better, Dad... You?
Okay, I'm slowing us down.
You read my mind.
He's busy being dead.
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
How many others killed?
Any of us?
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
Stand by.
Copy, Air Force One.
Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
That was war.
Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.
One thing I've learned as
Twenty minutes?
They've gotta be joking.
Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me.
No, Mr. President.  It can't.
Rose, I don't have time for this.
I miss you. And I miss her.
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
Then tell me there's a rescue operation underway.
We're handling it, sir.
But...
Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?
We're hooked. Hove into position.
That just doesn't make any sense.
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
What's the story?
Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
Te...!
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
Who's that, Ted?
Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you.
Ted!
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
You mean...
What will happen to him, Ted?
The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...
I guess this is a first for you.
No, I've been excited before.
Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.
Sure.
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
I'm doing everything I can! -- And stop calling me Shirley!
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
Certainly.
You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now.
I love you.
That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
And a little ice.
Good-bye, darling.
All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
Would you go up, please?
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
I like my horizons narrow.
I may be an asshole, but at least I'm a real detective, not some outer shit space thing.
Sergeant... Detective.  I wasn't aware there were any Newcomers at the rank of Detective yet.
That's right.  He and I, along with seven or eight others.  Listen, gentlemen, I will be happy to assist you in any way I can -- unfortunately, at the moment, I'm overdue at another function.
That is exactly so.  It is like your name... Sykes.  I'm sure it doesn't bother you at all that it sounds like "ss'ai k'ss", two words in my language which mean "excrement" and "cranium".
Yes.
A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley.
Uh, Matthew...
Screw me?  That can't be right.
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
Ta ss'trakyona'...
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
We?  You've taken it?
Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.
Ss-ai!
Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
Yeah... he was one Martin Helder. White male, twenty-seven.  Let's see... wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction, a couple for sale of a controlled substance. Oh yeah, and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock.
You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
It is. 
Whatever gave you that idea?
Yeah, that's comforting.  Mine, too.
Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.
In seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska.
Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.
Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.
Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command.  Right?
Sorry to disappoint you.
Forget it.
Yes, Hicks?
Not that tunnel, the other one!
That's right.  So we put up welded barricades at these intersections...  ...and seal these ducts here and here.  Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here.
Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?
Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.
Terrible.
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
I'm sorry, Newt.
Did one of those things grow inside her?
I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
Sure.  Go left.
That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock!  Like I said.
Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
Why?
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
Well, what does it matter to you?
Meaning you didn't like it.
Don't bother!
How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take.
I've come to dinnnnnner!
Oh shut up. I'm sick to death of that tune.
Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.
No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
Wolfi, I think your father's tired. I'll cook us something here.
Well, ask her!
You'd think I was mad.
I can't write it!
He's terribly busy, sir.
I understand.
Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
What for?
Should we stay here? It's a charming room. I love these candlesticks. Were they here earlier? I didn't notice them I suppose I was too nervous.
Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
Leave him alone!
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
He's doing his best.
Oh, yes.
Hey!
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
Wine?
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
Yes, Sire.
Twenty, sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives.
I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people.
Ah-ha. Well. There it is. Good.
I will.
How many pupils do you have?
Oh, let's not talk about it.
Why not?
Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
Is he working?
Are you Herr Mozart?
What?
What?
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
Can I see it?
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
Really?
My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late.
But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
Of course not.
Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
You burned the score?
Oh, Excellency, would you?
I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
How could I not?
Yes?
No, no. I have to get back. I have -
We ended in F Major?
What time?
Then why especially does it have to be in German?
Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care.
Just let me tell you how it begins.
Certainly, Herr Director.
Taking out what you should never have put in.
A little modesty would suit you better.
Who is on this committee?
Mozart -
Must I? Well, I won't! I tell you straight: I will not!
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
Ah - you've heard that?
Is it true?
Should I?
Yes.
The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands.
Oh my son, my poor son!
Oh yes, yes. And that was?
Ah.
I can't wait.
Come with me. And stay in the room.
Of course.
The American? Yes, duck.
He said 'Jack'.
Yes?
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
How old are you?
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
Will you think about it?
I'll let you know the next full moon.
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
A doper werewolf.
The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
No!
That's very funny, that is.
Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
Where am I?
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
Two weeks?
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
Good.
David.
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
Apparently so.
I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
Well, not quite a blood-thirsty mob.
A coyote.
There aren't any coyotes in England.
It's circling us.
Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
What?!
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
What's wrong with you? Shut up!
Will you be quiet?!
What?!
Stop it, Jack.
Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
Why don't we ask him?
What here?
Sorry, love.
No.
I want to know why .
But listen, Tom, I—
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
And tell him not to delay.
Just pure luck!
What about?
I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
I have everything I own in it. It's your bank as well as mine, isn't it?
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
We've been waiting fifteen minutes—
Oh!
All right, Jack, all right.
Well, you can. You always could.
Well—
Don't you know?
Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.
Good for you. Come on.
Let me see your cash book, will you?
Now?
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
Say, I know what's the matter with you. Matt!
Yes, sir.
Mr. Sampson . . .
I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.
No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
I don't want to hear any more about it. If you don't get married, I'll fire both of you.
Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
Yes, sir.
We haven't much on hand, you know. If it gets any worse, I hope we don't have to close the doors.
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
Yes, right in his office, the rat. I'd like to take a crack at that guy.
Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
They must have turned him down.
Matt, look! There's Mr. Jones!
Was it twelve o'clock?
That's all, Mrs. Halligan. Thanks.
They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it.
Never a good thing.
You stay out of this, Bob.
I ain't done --
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
Not yet. But I'm hoping.
Hey!
Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies.
He's planning a job.
I think I recognize you.
I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back.
I could use the walk.
Just like in the war. Harass their supply lines. We kill the railroad's men, they won't care.
Perfect, Cole.
I got three.
Hold on, hold on, we all know Bob is an important part of the gang.
A bad idea.
Pass me some whisky.
Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
Soon as I hit one, the other'll know and beat us up.
Get buckets!
Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?
Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.
The bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn't hurt.
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
I think he's already feeling better.
Don't care.
It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now.
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
Can't argue that.
Shush.
What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
Honestly, you'd do if only you had the buck teeth.
She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
"But the life of the James Gang wasn't all robbing and shooting and killing, for these young Missouri bucks had a taste for the ladies... especially the handsome and charismatic Jesse James."
Oh, I'm not finished.  "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple."  As I said. Hmm.
Yes ma'am.
I'll explain on the way.
Not that day. I am guilty of many things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker, that day.
Damn.
You don't think God'll mind, do you?
I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...
Thank you.
Who needs to repair a leaky church roof.
Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
I guess so.
I think so.
You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.
Lyla Devereux.
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
Really?
Just perfect.
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
Is that Donald Trump's car?
Yes, dear.
Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.
Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.
Take it off.
You just haven't been looking.
I don't think so.
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
Is your Evian spiked?
Because I...want...to...fit...in.
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
It's not.
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry.  You're just not terribly important to me.
What are the rules for a sweater vest?
I know her. I knew her.
Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while also promoting equal rights for women but change the abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain women's freedom of choice.
Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
I'm on a diet. But thank you.
What's that?
Sorry. 
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
What?
If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.  Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do?
I want the number, idiot.  Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you later and if I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I'm going to sic my hairdresser on you.
Does he do this all the time?
No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
No, really. I'm okay.
Well...
His girlfriend doesn't think so.
Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing.
Oh really? I didn't know that.
Don.
Not really.
Great, yes, I'd like that.
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
What am I gonna do?
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
You reek. You reek of...shit. Do you know that?  Goddammit, Al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of faggot. Al...I'm sorry.
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.
Cecelia is, well...you know 
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
It was a hate crime.
Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically.  Oh Jesus.
Poor baby. You know that's not true.
I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself.
Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
'Just didn't know who else to talk to.
Is it your dish?
He's working backwards, too.  Let's do number five?
There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.
Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world.
Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.
Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
You would? Wow. When would we come?  'Think he hung up.
Would you like a Coke or something?
It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
Don't spend too much time searching. You ever vetted somebody's old code before?  It's a different skill. Stay close to the surface. The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. You know the best place to hide a leaf, right?  In a tree.
Right... Right.
The wrong place?
What?
Let's get him in here.
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
Show me.
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
The Day Care?
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
What?
A what?
The dishes are juiced up, too.
Please don't go.
But you said the other --
Uh. Not exactly.
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come in, and I'll show you everything you need to know.
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
Good luck, Austin.
Thank you, Exposition.
Be careful.
Yes?
Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
Be careful.
Thank you.
What?
That's not your mother, that's a man!
Thanks.
Not quite, actually. Vanessa, I have something for you.
Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.
Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.
Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
I never forget a pussy... cat.
Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
Why?
Only sailors use condoms, man.
Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.
I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional.
Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis.  Just watch me. Watch me, now.
I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
That's not mine.
Sure.
I'm going to go across the street and get you some sherbert.
What are you saying, son?
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
What's its current position?
Dr. Evil?
I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?
Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
I don't want to.
I don't wanna take over the family business.
Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --
There are limits?
... head ...
Have we met?
Impossible?
Quite right, but we still make the rules.
We want to help...!
The Institute ... the funding ...
So am I.
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
Come, come, you're a widow -- a most attractive widow. Now I think of it, we'll need a bridesmaid. Here.
Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.
And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
Mother?
Do you really think so?
I should have thought that was obvious ...  I'm in mourning.
She had this in her mouth. There, there...
Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?
Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
Not that I know of.  Explanation?
According to Dr. Darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D.
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
Have a look at this.
But --
The plot.  Hello, we must be going ...
Pity your mother came, too ...
Decontamination -- ?
Or rather, you don't. Learnt the tricks in camouflage. Till this accident made a prang of things. How can I help you, Mrs. Peel?
Who's now vanished.
Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush English village transformed overnight into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?
We want Mrs. Peel.
Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.
Stay by the window. By the window.
Bobbie, what are you talking about?
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
I'd like to jerk and press those babies.
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
I'm very happy for you two.
But how can I do that?
If it were me, I'd reason with him first. Then, if that failed...  ...I'd take more persuasive action.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
I can't sleep.
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
You're on.
This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
I think I screwed that one once.
Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
What's going on?
All right. Now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. Go to bed right after "Falcon Crest."
No, have fun first. Then laugh. Now, forget about marriage for a while. Go party.
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
In a second...  And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
No, Brett, I...
It's all right...  So have I.
Nothing... Let's get crazy!
Olivier's in that, right?
Oooooo.
If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
I don't know.
Got me.
Take care.
And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...
You got it.
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.
Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
Stevie... I...
-- Stephen, this is bullshit --
Well, see you're wrong already. Had a talk with Chief Fitzgerald, and we decided in the interest of brotherly love, that maybe you shouldn't be way over on the other side of town. So starting tomorrow, your assigned to company 17. My company.  One case of scotch, you're getting cheap in your old age, Brian...
It worked when you were in sixth grade.
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
That was never proved.
What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that I don't think is going to make it.
Shut up!
Thanks for calling.
How's it going?
I don't have the slightest idea...
I don't have a story.
Good. -- So our two heroes, Adcox and McCaffrey, they go back inside. Only there's another fire in there nobody sees. And it took your dad, didn't it Brian? Did you see him burn?
Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
See you Monday. Sir.
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
What are you listening to?
-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
Ever burned magnesium? It's so hot it takes water molecules and BAMM!
Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder.
And the putty around the door?
I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts. 
No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.
Four months.
Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.
"Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."
It's in my blood, Willy.
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
I was ahead of my time.
Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
Here we go...
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
-- You remember.
He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
And old ladies?
-- Burn them.
I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?
OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God?
Nah...
I know.  Take care of yourself, man, OK? Be cool.
How about 7 1/2?
What case?
Yesterday morning, God gave me but one chance to use something else to serve Him. Not my arms or my legs, but something I used for the first time, for the last time, and will never use again. My vagina.
Yo Black, you looking for trouble.
Ho!
I'm gonna start a chant and I want y'all to follow me.  Let's make our own 2 real coons know you're ready to start the show.
If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  You got your ways to affect change, I have mine.  And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.
That's mighty black of you.
What do you do?
Ladies and gentlemen, there is no need to go there.  We can all agree to disagree without making threats.
Why are you smiling so?
Certified ladies' man, huh?
Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.
Seconds and thirds, too.
I'm out.
So that's what you been doing?
De-la-croix.
You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
Manray needs a job.
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
That's right.  Money turns the wheel.
Why?
How you sound?
That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water.
Go on.  Good so far.
Let'em try.  I will kill to make this happen.
I don't know about that plantation angle.
That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
This has to be a big mistake.
I want to speak with you.
Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
Pleased to meet you.
So what's up with you?
Your father is proud of you.
How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.
The idea was out there in the universe.  Now what?
You getting cold feet?
Which one is your brother?
How so?
I don't want to hear it.
I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready.
Yeah.
Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
That's wonderful.  Isn't that what you always wanted, a show of your own?
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
Mommy, please don't call me that.
You know how your Daddy is.
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
The best defense is offense.
This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black.
So what's up with you and DeLa?
Are you and him kicking it? Knocking boots. Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout.
Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.
Go to your windows and yell out, scream with all the life you can muster up inside your assaulted, bruised and battered bodies.  I'M SICK AND TIRED OF NIGGERS AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE!
Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?
I thought you got rid of...
...yes she did.
...I heard different, thought that was...
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
What do you want to know?
Oh you do, huh?
After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
Say what, Manray?
And his baggage?
Oh!  That will be sent after him.  I have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers, you say; and at noon, after parade, shall be at the inn.  You will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair, and will wait for me at the Chevalier's rooms until my arrival.  We must force that box.  You are a clumsy hound, or you would have got the key long ago.
Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
It must have been some other gate.
Is Miss Dugan well?
She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.
He has paid off your uncle's mortgage.  He gave Dorothy a coach- and-six.  That coward of a fellow has been making of your uncle's family.  Faith, the business was well done.  Your cousins, Michael and Harry, never let him out of their sight, though he was for deserting to England, until the marriage was completed, and the happy couple off on their road to Dublin.  Are you in want of cash, my boy?  You may draw upon me, for I got a couple of hundred out of Master Best for my share and, while they last, you shall never want.
I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.
Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.
All Europe shall hear of this!
I believe they will deport you.
Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.
I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
Then you yield to me.
I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.
A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.
I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet.
Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.
Yes!
Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.
Hmm-mmmm.
The Prince left him only that choice.
What is to be done?
Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...
I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.
Good night, my little darling.
Is he all right, papa?
Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?
I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
Dark Valdez.
If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
He loves me, as I love you.
Will he wish to know the details of this night?
Don't you mean "don't need no liquor license not taken away from me"?
What do we do?
We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!
Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
What do you like then?
You did Basic here?
I'm serious --
Do what?
You won't find them. Won't find West, either. He's too good.
No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class.
Epilepsy.
What business?
Would you have believed me?
Can't do that now, though, can you?
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
So did we. Why didn't you come?
Just look. Little pocket.
Full clip to the body --
That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.
Put it down!
My, my, my, how did things turn so hostile so quickly? If I didn't know better, I'd say you two were out to get me.
Then who did?
Mr. Hardy?
Stop.
Can I go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot?
There's that word again.  As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting.
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
No. I said Dunbar.
I didn't do anything --
I didn't --
Maybe --
And I'm the closest thing to it, right?
Nevertheless --
Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
That's horseshit and you know it.
I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
That's preposterous --
Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited Kendall.
No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --
Is Dunbar cute?
Microrecorder for Kendall -- didn't have time to wire his room. Now tell me why you joined the army or I'll jab this pen through your neck.
Little bit.
What?
Positive. Hardy, they planned this.
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
You mean the falsely accused?
Think it'll work?
For what?
Nah.
Because he'd shot Mueller.
Not much time to solve the crime. Tell me, detective, how did it feel taking blood money from Guissepe Torres? Did it weigh on your conscience or did you just not think about it?
Then he's mistaken. You know, I really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning --
We did get our stories straight, but not because we killed anyone.  It was because I threatened him.
I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --
Yeah.
He's not Army, it's not official --
Sir, yes, sir!
Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
Kid. Don't waste your time. She's out of your league.
I'll work night and day, and you won't have to pay me. You just have to tell me who she is.
There's only one I want.
Why?
Let's see it.
Your mother came in about three in the afternoon. Her neighbor drove her, on account of your father was on business in Wichita. You were born a week early, but there were no complications. It was a perfect delivery. Now, your father was sorry to miss it, but it wasn't the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries then, so I can't see as it would have been much different had he been there. And that's the real story of how you were born.
It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her.
I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.
And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.
No, I understand.
Please?
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
You learned from the best.
So how does it happen?
You owe me three-fifty.
I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
I have been nothing but myself since the day I was born. And if you can't see that, it's your failing, not mine.
The River!
You didn't become crazy.
I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork.
Probably tonight.
You don't have to.
I'm going with you.
Did you?
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
Mmm, what?
Do you love him?
He's up with your father.
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
I paid for those guitar cases.
It is. I did it cooking.
Name it.
I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.
And...
I am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. I just noodle along, I'm not so good. He makes me look like a retard -- He smokes me. I don't mean he smokes me.
No, no...
Uh. Do you like England?
No. It is too judgmental.
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
Syevodnya
Shut up. Have you got your passport?
I don't have any money.
But, you know, so what?
And? What are you saying?
And who says what is wrong.
So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
I wasn't saying anything.
Then okay.  So how old were you when you met him?
Not really. Maybe a little.
She's alive?
I've got news for you. It's not working.
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
Nobody's that unhappy.
Whatever.
I'm sorry.
No. What? No. I know.
You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?
You hurt it?
That'd be nice.
You ain't the kicker, are you?
No, ma'am.
For your hands?
She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
How long... how long I been out?
What?
If I break one you gonna shoot me?
Uh-uh.
If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk.  Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  You know how to boil water?
No, you do it. I can't sing.
Shit. Who hasn't?
She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?
She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
He knows where ya at. Just answer the door if he come knockin'.
You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
Ask the chef.
She's tied to me, R.L.. We tied to each other.
The fuck are all these people doin' here? Been drinkin' in this shit hole for years ain't seen this many people since I don't know...
I don't know, but I been told, them Georgia women sweet jelly roll.
That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.
My mouth is shut, boy. And that's how we gonna keep it. Don't go braggin' to ya buddies, ya heard me?
Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to eat.
Rae, look at Ronnie. And tell him how you feel.
Hey.
Only thing I'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what I should'a done.
What'd I tell you?  I don't do none of that shit no more. I'm in communications now.
The hell you call me?
Still, you gotta wonder how she'd look in handcuffs.
-- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.
Get rid of it.
Why?
Number five with a bullet.
Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's.  Let's book, Charlie.  If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night.
Why the hell not?
Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
Nick --
I'll be a nice Gaiijin.
I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.  I like him waiting.
I followed them.  An hour from the train station.
Joyce?
Me too.
He gets as much as he wants.
I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
I don't think so.
It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
I don't remember saying yes.
The cheese...
Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
The old man was a Japanese paper manufacturer.  Hotel room and rental car were full of it.
What?
Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.
I have to get to Sugai.
Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.
You want him dead too.
Anywhere.
You underestimate the trap, Mary.
Here's your check, my boy.  Thank you.
Had in mind something a little more radical.
Well, no, not really.  There's Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman, he lives on the first floor.
Nexus - 6.
You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.
Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.
Industrial refuse.
Got it.
You start.
Thank you very much.
Ya.
Four years.
Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
Too old.
Of course.
Do you recognize any of them?
You talking about the Opera House on the Main?
Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
How are you doing?
If they are smart, they take naps.
That's another thing I can't do.
I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.
I don't like people snooping around my stuff.
I never felt better.
Because it's not.
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
That some of the folks around here are more programmed then me.
Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response?  Plus fluctuation of the pupil, plus involuntary dilation of the iris?
Sitting next to you.
You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.
I'm tired of this.
Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you...
You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon.
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
Just better.
As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.
He's really funny!
Really?
Shallow? I'm shallow?!
Do you own a car?
Mind if I change the station? Better traffic reports on AM.
Oh, I could die...
Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like starving people?
Night!
I guess we'll need another locker.
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
The engine is still running.
Never drive again!
I thought only hookers drank those things.
May I please be excused?
It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair!
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
But, Eve, I would--
I know first aid!
Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....
Yes, sir.
Tempus fugit!
Gerade aus dann links!
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
Blow out the candles!
Yes, sir.  Is that all?
I promise. Is that all?
Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.
Yeah.
What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
No.
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
Yeah...Seems to.
How old are you?
I guess living up here makes people look older.
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
Hi.
I'll go up.
Yes, ma'am.
I just hope this is still good up there.
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
Well, where are you --
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
And now you must let me be the judge of that!
All back East.
He drank it hot?
To you maybe.
To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.
Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
You bet.
Yeah. Let's dig in!
You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
I know exactly what you mean!  Hey, honey?
I want him to at least see the sky!
Some time.
Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
Always good advice.
It's not so much what you say but how you say it.  Women like men who are unpredictable.
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
He left with Sophie.
You're goddamn right I am!
Give it back to him.
See these?  Found them in the box with the cards.  These are stock certificates.  IBM.  AT&T.  Polaroid.
What?!
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
Uh...yeah. It's like hard.
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to the ocean?
Roger, Wolf One.
Yeah. How's Dad?
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
I'm not sick.
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go.
If you like Frank. Here's to your fuck. Cheers.
You did? A human ear?
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
Yes?
The criminals are winning.
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Oh my God. Is her son OK?
Yeah.
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
No. Come on.
No, please. I won't.
You don't?
OK.
Same here.
Falling.
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK?
I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
No police!!!  No police!!
Yes.
Frank would open you.
Does that scare you?
Do you love me?
No, it's not Don.
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
I did. Are you?
Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
No. Not really.  But also because I really want you to be alright.
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Oh he forced you, huh?
Speak to me Fucker.
I don't want to go.
On a ride.
Be right down.
Jeffrey! Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store, maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
Do you want the car?
Alright.
Alright.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Good deal Dad.
How is Central these days?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Alright.
You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?
Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.
You saw a lot in one night.
Yes.
I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
What is it?
Go ahead.
Oh fuck! 
I bounced you on my knee at family reunions, for Christ sakes. Your dad and me ran the whole east coast syndicate you snot-nosed little prick. And when you took the wheel, who was beside you?
Got it.
Weird, huh?... Know what I think is weird? Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison.
Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it. I've been working for those fat bastards since I was in high school and look at this place.
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
What?  What, that guy?
We're here brother.
Ma, what's wrong?
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
Our mother can see through bags.
We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.
me up the...
Ass!
Aye.
Shut it. It's Ma.
If that was a girl I want ta see some papers. She had ta be just preoperative for Christ sakes.
"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
Holy shit. Who? How many?
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.
That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.
Can she I.D. them?
They were wearing masks.
You killed my... my...
These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name?
Eight.
Shit! Shit!
It tells us that he was the last to die. All these men  Were carrying. They came in, dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man. Didn't they, Duffy?!  They sure as fuck did!
Who were the victims?
Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?
Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no. I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the funny man... the funny.
Oh yeah. You two fuckin' Micks know what's going on, huh?  Fuck you!
No. You sure you're okay?
Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.
Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
No. They would never do that.
Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them.
I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
Just go!
The... The funny man.
Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.
Right. The blond guy.
OK. That's wrong.
No. It's a real episode. The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones.
This is he?
See, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. Whereas my strength would be --
Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
Five, seven, eight dollars.
Yeah.
I don't want to use it.
What about them?
Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.
As long as he gets out OK.
Don't worry about it, Bob.
They blamed my family for everything. They always said Mr. Langston saved Anthony's life.
I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
What are you going to do, get married? Have a bunch of little idiot janitor brats! And go around scrubbing the --
Right now.
Let me feel that.
OK. Mark that down.
It's like we've finally arrived.
So do I.
Stand by, Bird Dog.
Applejack! What's happening?
Get against the wall!
I'll see you there.
Yeah.
Nothing.
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.
Dignan, I --
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
Take a deep breath.
That sounds like Dignan.
Who?
Future Man. You know. Cause he looks like he's from the future.
Yeah. I've stolen two cars before. One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With T- Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to drive.
Phil probably provoked him.  Where's he going?
I don't know. I don't know anything. Except Phil says they got him. And he's in jail.
Were you adopted, Bob?
Why do you say that?
Nothing. I was just asking.
Dies y nueve.
No.
God. That does sound corny. Oh, your skin feels so soft and silky. But it really kind of does.
You're Anthony?
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
I don't know about that.
I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?
Not even for emergencies?
I thought your parents were in Italy.
OK, Bob.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
That's your domain.
Don't count it.
No. I was calm.
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
Come on, Dignan.
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
Anthony. Bad news.
I know it, man. Hang on.
Stand by. Bird Dog?
Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
What's that?
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
Do you have your own cell?
I'm trying.
The basic grammatical rules of robbing.
Who? Applejack?
Where?
You Hoto?
Good to know you, John.
The world needs dreamers. To relieve the pain of consciousness.
With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.
Excuse me.
You don't know what you're getting into here.
Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
Thanks.
The sooner the better.
Including Landy...  She had access to the archives.
YOU'RE A LIAR!
Look at me.
Is this really happening?
I worry when you get like this.
It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
What?
-- not yet --
What if it's not who you think it is?
There must be another way!
It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
It might have.
Last week? When?
You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
What's that?
I'm working on it.
Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.
-- uplink all relevant files to Kim --  -- and I want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with Treadstone --
Here?
We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
So he fooled you.
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!
They've been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of God's church, and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation. So please -- do it.
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.
That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace.
I have ordered conscriptions...
What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
How many?
In order to find his equal, and Irishman is forced to talk to God.  Yes, Father!...  The Almighty says don't change the subject, just answer the fookin' question.
A common thief.
In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
Humbly, M'lord.
Thank you for inviting.
Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.
I... accept your proposal!
My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!
He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
Wife of Edward, the king's son?
It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
I can't bear the thought of your torture. Take it!
The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
No English lord would trust an Irishman!
I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --
And the bad news?
Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.
The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions.
I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
My father has a bad memory, too?
Honey. What were you doing with that?
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
Cute, Evan.
So you believe me?
I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?
All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
He must be. They're letting him go, right?
Wow. That must've taken some courage.
Me? Are you kidding? Why?
Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
Those are your clothes, silly.
Go on. Sit down.
Like how?
I walk differently?
Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
Now's the only time!  Today you get a chance to redeem yourself. Start over with a clean slate. Tabula rasa --
Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
Then you think it might have worked out?
Listen close then, fuckbag. You screw up again and I swear I'll flat out castrate you.
But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me.
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
Maybe if I can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain.
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
It was like Tommy was possessed or something. There was a hate in his eyes that I couldn't really call human.
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
Get this "us" shit. As if I was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. You've done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking my sister. Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself.
I'll do whatever you want. You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
You're such a retard!
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
My husband is with me, too.
So you decided to go to America.
And you want to know --
He always has.
You want my advice?
Oh, yes, please.
-- He's just a lucky guy.
Goodnight.
Yes, I come, I will do it.
Er, my check, please.
I have to warn you, sir. I beseech you...
I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
Those letters were not found on Ugarte when they arrested him.
Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
Here's looking at you, kid.
Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?
I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
I'm not fighting for anything anymore, except myself. I'm the only cause I'm interested in.
Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.
Everything is quite all right.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.
Goodnight.
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
No, Victor, there isn't.
Won't you join us for a drink?
What for?
Right.
What of it?
I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
What of it? Then it'll be out of it's misery.
You seem to know all about my destiny.
Yes.
I was informed you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca. That was a gross understatement.
We'll be there.
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
Yes.
You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
Good evening, Captain.
I see what you mean.
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
Our entertainment is enough.
Yeah? What's his name?
I have my orders.
And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.
That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.
Well, it looks like you're a little late.
Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.
You didn't come here to tell me this. You have the letters of transit. You can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please. Why are you interested in what happens to Laszlo?
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
Oh, he won't be followed here.
I have. Sit down over there.
You think of everything, don't you?
Sacha, she's had enough.
Don't listen to him, Sacha. Fill it up.
-- Sacha, call a cab.
There seems to be no secret about that.
Put it down!
No.
For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.
Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
He'll double what I pay you.
You ever going to bed?
Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
So how are we going to get this place shaped up?
The failures they remember.  It's the successes they forget.
Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix rope.
With what?  There's nothing to fix it with.  This rope comes undone, you're going to drown.
Survive today, that's the point.
They'd eat you if they could.  They're laughing at you.  Listen.
But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.
Let's get a second opinion.  Wilson? What do you see?
Okay.  Sure.
Yeah.  A long time ago.
I've got lots of time.
You smell like formaldehyde.
Cold.
You don't seem too happy about it.
I would never --
That's what I told the fish I caught. But I ate them anyway.
Terrific.  Yours?
Anything else?
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.
So did I.
That new roof, that's your doing.
This is my home.  I'm part of the wallpaper.
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
Baloney.  I do see the damn "big picture."
Forget it.
We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice.
I never thought it would end.  Then it did.  It was so great to be saved, I couldn't stop laughing.
That's what it's about.
Finish what you started.  You haven't changed, Chuck.  It's still you.
You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.
Just find him some clothes, Wilbur. He could use some clothes.
We all know who trained Homer--his credentials are as good as mine are. Don't you be holy to me about the *law*! What has the law done for any of us here?
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
Better than I can!
Sometimes I want to meet them so I can kill them. Just sometimes.
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
Sure... I'll see you around.
"King Kong". It's really good.
Oh, sure!
But you had so much *responsibility*.
That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!
He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I.
Rose, I know what's going on. Homer told me. I got pregnant, too--about a year ago.  I've been through this.
No--keep it down. I want to feel the air.
I love you, too. See you tomorrow.
I wouldn't worry, Edna, that he doesn't have money. If he gets hungry, he can pick his dinner!
She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
His father's dead, right?
Where are you going?
You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
I don't think so, Homer. *I'm* the lucky one.
Of *course* there's worms, Homer! And what is them worms, really? They just *protein*, them worms! They is *good* for you!
You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
How long's this been going on, Muddy?
"Two: Please don't go up to the roof to eat your lunch."
Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?
You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't want to be in that Wally's shoes tonight.
Why was he missing for twenty days?
It's encephalitis B. He's recovering at Mount Lavinia Hospital, Ceylon.  Uh... Captain Worthington is paralyzed.  Waist down. He won't walk.
What's lucky about that?
You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
She took off on the bicycle, man.
Silicon Valley?
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
What do I do? I'm the VP of Finance.
That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.
Big.Com. That Internet thing.
Sort of like a letter of intent.
The Anti-Christ?
Gee... What makes you say that?
Just the last three weeks.
I was doing it for them.
BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.
Yes it is, Jake! Yes it is! They were right there for you. She was right there for you! Look at her!
Fine. But only if we recover the cash.
It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys.
Stake you?
I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we're done.
Well he's in town and he sure as shit remembers you. What are we going to do about this Jake? We can't afford to have a Fed onto us.
Don't worry about Moonan. We got him covered. When...?  It was him. There's a shipment coming through tonight. Kennedy.
It's just that I left my asshole decoder ring at home, so how do I know not to worry?
And some new clothes.
You're just going to have to trust me.
Did I miss something?
Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
How do you know I will?
We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird.
Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor, that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off.  He said he was going to "fuck some sense into me."
Miles...
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
Where the hell is she?
What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous.
What?
Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into something big?
Pretty much.
It's not history.
A Fed? Is he close?
Look, I'm not a confrontational person by nature.
Peace of mind.
Literally. It's not a bad deal, gentleman. I get peace of mind. You get Detective Sheilds. But this is the best part, Walter... Walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile. Capice?
It's cosmetic. They don't cover cosmetic. Last year I had a tooth capped. The dentist tells me I'm not covered for caps. It's cosmetic.
I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.
Put your hand down. I don't high five.
No. Thanks.
Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
Now he's a real shit. Don't get friendly with him. I'm sure he's got his hand in the till. You know what he said to me once? "I want to fuck the whole world over. That's my mission." The shit!
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
We all played the field.
All right. As what?
Looking forward!
Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
Good God, no. But with skill like that, what do you want a job for? You don't need to work.
She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.
I had training. In the Republic.
You will?
Marion!  What did you tell the police?
What?
All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him.
I owe a lot of money.
I don't have any money.  switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.
The point is, they want a man inside.
Robbery's not criminal?
What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
Well, life's not fair. We know that.
It's all relative.  I need the money too.
No thank you.
You did?
I'm Lucy.
I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
She's my baby.
Some other time.
I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
No thanks.
What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.
I put them on together.
In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa.  You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you?
We do. 
I said good call.
What for?
How?
All right, Mr Reynolds.
Bruised.
It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack.
Time to start talking.
Talby, can you read me?
Do you remember the detonation time?
Armed.
I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
No.
And I saw that I was alone.
Exactly.
Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
I have no proof that it was false data.
Out where?
Ah, negative drop.
-- Remark.
You'll have plenty of time for that, you know. Figure it this way: twenty years in space and we've only aged three, so there'll be plenty of time to stare around...
Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...
I can't seem to locate the malfunction exactly...
Sounds good, Talby. Let me know if anything important comes up.
Calm down, Talby. I'm coming.
Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
Yes sir. Negative effect.
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
Phenomenology...
Justine was not an unwilling participant.
It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued, causing you to maybe take offense.
I'm really glad we're having this conversation.  You're right.  I was angry at you.  But talking about it-- The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault.  Can you ever forgive me?
Later.
I couldn't get to her.  It all happened so fast.  Logan had her, and I saw him fall...then Peter told me to run.  And then he...and I remember so clearly, thinking it's me they want.  If I run, maybe they'll come after me.  Maybe they won't think about her... So I ran...
No...
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
Thank God.
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
Whoever that is.
Who is...
The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, and destroyer, giver of life, who lives forever... I could keep going.
One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
Is the social studies class over for today?
It was open.
So saw my hands off, I left you a present.
We are not fine.
You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
Your help.
You believe that?
Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
None.
With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
Oh?
He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
He says he got it from a woman.  Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove.
You and me both.
Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
At least he didn't swing with your ride.
What?
You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious...
And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.
Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.
Not right now?  Okay, when?
But I'll take a rain check...
Max--
You left out condescending.
A toy?
She tells you how I've been--
How'd you get her out of town?
She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
Okay, okay, okay--
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before?
Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?
That'd be great. Hey, maybe someday your band'll play there. It's a college town, you know?
Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.
Bye.
What? That's disgusting!
You got in the car, didn't you?
So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!
The paint!
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later.
It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.
Well then, I suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing KISS tickets. I realize this is Detroit, but I personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as Lucifer's kingdom. I'll return in a little while.
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together!
Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us.
Hello summer detention.
I can see that, bright boy. What happened to it?
Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
Look, I want to live, but I don't know where the fuck I'm gonna find two hundred bucks.
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
Now that's what I like to hear!  Because too many young men and women today are paralysed by their fears. They give in to their feelings of self-doubt... they surrender their bodies to the temptations of drugs, alcohol and premarital sex. Empty solutions. These are toxic chemicals... and disease-spreading behaviour.
-- and be able to find one of these wormholes.
You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end.
You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
You have a request?
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
Sure.
He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
You want to kiss me...
Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.
And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
Hey. You OK?
Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills?
Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.
I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
Would you like to talk about this friend?
Frank.
What else do you think about during school?
I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
How does that make you feel?
Do you feel alone right now?
Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?
The good stuff.
But you were punished.
Yes. I went to jail.
That I did it again.
Why did you do these things, Donnie? Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes?
Because I'm so horny.
Thank you.
Why would I tell Mom?
Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum.
Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
But now you can't go.
Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.
Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
I AM THE PTA! And I say that this FILTH is directly related to this vandalism.
She's alive, sweetie.
She's right over there.
You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
My jacket. Take it 'cause, y'know, I got my costume okay'd before the pageant. You can wear it.
Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.
No. Loretta called. There's been a... a fire.
They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
That's it, I'm goin'...
Honest to God, if I got to do it over? I'd start walkin' outta this town the minute I took my first step. Practically the only thing I wouldn't do different is have you...
It's okay.
Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.
But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
Bye.
"Most smartest?" Oh, that's good, Loretta. Make sure you get a picture of that. "Most smartest." We're cuttin you off and sendin' you home.
I'll be right back. See ya later.
You don't know where this is gonna...
So? Be real easy.
Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
That's right.
Mm-hm.
All right, then.
The bitch.
And the year before that?
Oh, my!  Hello, Father Donigan! Sidewalks, sidewalks?
That's why we Lutherans use grape Koolaid for the blood of Christ.
All right, let's go.
"Proud... to be... an... American."
Yeah.
What, you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP!  Cut her outta this!
He should be king!
Suppose a pretty dame Into my castle came - And let us say that I was going strong.  She might be stuck on me, but what good would it be, if the king can do no wrong.
Take another letter...  to my tailor.
I'll have to enclose the check first.
Send for my car...
They'll know I mean business then they get that letter...  see that that gets out immediately and that goes for you too.
No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
Oh, yes, I remember -- and I should have slapped Mrs. Teasdale's face when she told it to me... I'm going right out and find Trentino.  You go right out and get yourself an army.
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?
Well, with you two fellows on the other side, this country should have no trouble keeping the wolf from the door.
Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum...  I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.
Once more! 
Yes.
Forget?  You ask me to forget... Why, my ancestors would rise from their graves... and I'd only have to bury them again... A Firefly never forgets...
I don't remember.
I still like UPSTART the best.
Take a seat -- you're next. 
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
The king can do no wrong!
I didn't come here to be insulted.
For you, I would do anything... 
What do you mean?
I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't be bothered, I won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
He fell.  He falls.
You listen, you're not going to have much of a livelihood if this man dies. He's got the rale, he's very weak, and I don't know how much damage has been done by his "fall". Now stop wasting time and fetch a cab.
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
You don't own this man!
So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!
It's quite nutritious, sir.
Oh, is he a friend of yours?
Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
I'm sorry too. He simply doesn't belong here. He's be much happier somewhere else, where he could be constantly looked after. Believe me, Frederick, it's better that it worked out this way. Good day.
Mmmm. Hodges, Pierce come closer. Mr. Hill, take hold of the rope please. It's a machine accident. I expect you'll be seeing a good deal of this.
Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me".
Oh, no. I would never think it! It's so beautiful. You are so... I'll give it a place of honor, here, next to my mother.
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you...
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.
You know, I saw you once there, in London. You're a great attraction.
Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
Say "Mmmerrick."
Righteousness...
Yes.
John.... how can you ever forgive me?
Oh no, I couldn't.
Fine.
Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?
Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.
No, he's very upset about something.
Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir.
I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.  That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
WELCOME?
What are what?
Those things in your hands.
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
Five this week; how many the week before?
Halfdan the Black.
Then let go!
No... no...
Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.
It was my master Keitel's idea.
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
The sky WAS blue, Erik... once.
The Gods decreed that if ever a sword spills human blood upon these shores, the whole of Hy-Brasil will sink beneath the waves.
Really.
And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?
Yes?
He wants to kill US!
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
Yes... oh, yes...
Aaagh! Rape!
Well... no...
It saved my father!
Very deep... usually...
You talking piffle, son?
Who have you been talking to?
She got me thinking...
Row! Row! Row!
You may need a real Berserk.
What "magic"?
Look out!
Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
Bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end and stop all this fighting and bloodshed.
But you're the Gods!
You'll be sucked down too!
Nobody gets killed.
Keitel Blacksmith?
But how could he know... unless...
How about making friends?
She MUST have a knife or something...
Bye... sorry...
Yeah... well...
I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
You're wasting your time.
Oh, yes! I hadn't noticed that!
You could charge him what you like.
You can't let Erik do THAT.
How can we stops him now?
You'll be able to throw it further than I could.
Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!
You fool!
Sh!
Helpless...
Erik's right! We'll all meet in Valhalla.
I never do...
They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.
Just a little overworked, maybe.
Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
I like it.
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
I'm Joel.
I don't know any jokes about your name.
Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Yeah, I guess.
It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
Sounds good. But right now I should go.
Well... if they're looking for me in memories I'm in, what if you take me to a memory I'm not in?  And we can hide there till morning.
Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden.
He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
Egad, were you horrified?
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
Remember me. Try your best. Maybe we can.
yeah?
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
I think she's great.
Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
At least I haven't been barking up the wrong tree.
No, it's our house! Just tonight --  -- we're David and Ruth Laskin. Which one do you want to be? I prefer to be Ruth but I'm flexible.  Alcohol! You make drinks. I'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth. I'm ruthless at the moment.
Tomorrow?
Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.
-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
I'm nervous, too.
A bully? Moi?
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.
I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
How's it going?
But I went back to my food. The next thing I remember, I felt someone sitting next to me and I saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye.
I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.
What? What do you mean?
The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
Hi, Rob and Carrie.
In a minute.
A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
Hi.
Yeah.
What?
Shit!
Yes?
Well, thank you, Mary.
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
Alexander Pope?
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
Jesus.
Of course. Please have a seat.
Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
This one's history. Moving on...
Patrick, we're in the middle of --
Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.
Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home.
Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
What guy?
It's not the air conditioner that's making me cold. Nothing moves in here. Not even your birds.
Why? Why do you have to go?
As I developed, however, I grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style. Time in terms of M.P.H. no longer interested me. I began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time: slow, ancient, vast. When I am really moving, stopping car after car after car, moving so freely, so clearly, so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass, then I embody the rhythms of the universe. I am in a state of grace.
Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender.
What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...
I'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it. Now step aside, old man.
Will it work?
I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you.
Goddammit, DJ, it was not a hallucination! I saw a man, he was on fire. And then he disappeared.
"Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...
You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
How do you know all this?
I built it.
I'm going in.
I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
Peters...
If it worked.
What about it?
I don't know.
What do you want me to say?
I don't know...
That's exactly what we don't have, Doctor.
Then who the fuck are you?
You're lying...!
I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me.
Something like that, yeah.
Love to.
You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you with me?
That's enough!
Captain, we got a problem.
What is it, Smith?
Come again, Skipper?
Let's go.
Come around to three-three-four...
It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.
No. It was someone else.
Who?
He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
Five seconds.
Yes.
DJ!  It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.
You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
I've seen bodies before. This is different.
Can you shut it down?
Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own.
Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...
Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
I wouldn't know anything about that.
What is this? Where's Reed?
This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
Yeah, nine years straight.
Got it, teach.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
Go back to the drawing board.
I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window --
What about you?
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
Blockhead started it!
As soon as you stop acting like one. Come on, you're smarter than this. You think those people out there care about you? You're just a fad to them.
Yes, thanks.
What...?  Oh.
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
No, I distinctly remember: you walked out my door. Ergo...
That would have kinda defeated the purpose. And Reed...  I'm saying it now.
Not at all.
Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
Ben's still out there --
Ben did this.
I don't want to understand it. This isn't one of your science projects. I just want to fix it. Fast!
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
Skeptical...?
On the ledge?
Yes. I think so. Show some pride, Hamilton.
No. I want my money back right now.
Hey-yo.
Your friends use the pool too.
Don't strain yourself.
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
Where did you hear that?
Well... it's true.
Get a ride with somebody.
How about both of us at the same time?
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.
Get going.
I'm really pretty busy...
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
What do you read? What's the last book you read?
And don't let them talk you into a diaphragm either.
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
They're fuckin' with us.
You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
My brother is gonna shit.
Do you think that guy's cute?
What should I do?
I can't do that.
Really?
What variables?
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
Not since November.
You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.
No.
God, I don't think so. Better look in the house.
I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing.
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
What class?
Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
Well, then, I'm glad I remembered to bring an extra copy just for you.
Aloha, Spicoli.
I know, everyone says that.
Where do you feel like going?
It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
Yes... I am really nineteen.
We keep them.
Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
Well... it's getting kind of late.
John Bonham?
Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
Two Cokes.
I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.
Not for me.
Righto!
Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."
We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
You know what I mean. We've done it before and we can damn well do it again!
I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.
That's a fine combination. You can't lose.
Don't worry...  ...and I'm actually the District Attorney from Ignoto County.  Just another good American like yourself.
Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this?
Not yet. I want to study its habits.
I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
Why what?
Get sheep over side... women and children to armored car... orders from Captain Zeep.
That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight. I have to put the car in the lot.
Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit." I want a rising sound.
BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...
What? Fuck telegrams. I'm in trouble. You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that? When I finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred!
I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.
They'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs.
Lucy is looking for you.
Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me. I got your message... what? Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what?  No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while. Yeah. I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out...
Never mind, it's absolutely pure.
No! I swear I'm not!
Of course, officer.
Part of what?
They can't get in here!  You said it yourself, they'll get in!
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
Nah, I got the gun.
C'mon guys--
Well, your last words can be "I told you so."
No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
Follow me.
What?
You weren't helpin'.
Oh yeah?
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
Your brother, huh?
Just cover me. It was built to move.
It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
What?
So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
Fully.
Open?
Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack.
YOU'LL HIT US!
Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.
I'm not lying.
I said I'm not lying.
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
You're afraid!
I'm not!
Who is she?
Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says "Dimout Zone?"  There's a war on, you know?
GET OUT!
Claire?
All square, Doc.
No.
And I can't understand how it can hurt to be honest, but the more I tried to explain -- 
I love you too, Francie.
Thank you.
They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood.
I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.
Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist --
Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.
Don't be a rat, Harry.
You're not the quiet type, Frances.
Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.
You jackass!  C'mon, let's get out of here.
Harry... I met someone.
You're telling me.
But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something... 
What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?
The hell you will, Harry York.
I know.
Have I told you how mean you're turning, York?
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
No. To thoroughbreds.
Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
That's fine with me...  Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
Who're you?
I live here.
But I want to. I'm trying!
You think I got it?
Smile, little sister, smile.
Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister. Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star!
No, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll wash them in the morning.
I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
What is that to you? Evil as you are.
Build for him a pyre. Light up the sky with his passing.
It can't be as bad as that.
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
Friend?
I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.  I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours.  You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein.
And you look so lovely.
Read him one of the old letters and rephrase it. We'll say it came today. It'll set his mind at ease.
She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.
And you?
...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.
Elizabeth. My more than sister.
It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
But you haven't listened, Never in history has so much seemed possible. We're on the verge of answers undreamt of... but only if we have the courage to ask the questions.
Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
I've been preoccupied.
A... week?
Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together.
What is your name?
Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?
Madness?
You told her to sweep the courts.
I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve.
Un-hunh.
And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes -- like you don't care about children...
Absolutely.
Wet. I don't know.
You're welcome.
Sometimes I only think about kissing women.
Coach, athletic director somewhere.
Wait, wait! When I was finding these goodies in the shed. I also found this letter which a camper never sent home. Listen.
Like waves. It's never been likes waves before.
No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
I got to.
The truth hurts.
He's running the show.
It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
It's about money, all right, but not yours. You see, me and my brother here are in a little hot water and we need your assistance.
Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?
I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business.
Yes.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
Didn't like it, did ya?
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
He backed down.
Are you so much a fucking loser, you can't tell when you've won?
Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.
I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.
Mexico.
Do what?
You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.
Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind?
What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?
Four Rangers, three cops, and two civilians. And they took a lady bank teller as a hostage.
He signaled the Ranger.
Gotcha!
One... Two... Three.
-- This conversation is over.
She's in the other room.
Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut.
Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks.
We are?
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
I'm lookin' scared?
It don't look together.
Thank you, ensign.
More than you'd guess.  It's just that we don't hold coffee klatches. If more then three of us get together at any one time, the guys think it's some kind of uprising.
-- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution.
Jordan, dear.  How are they treating you?
Of course, but there's more --
I'm fine, sir.
It's you, sir.  And it started the day I came here.
The shape doesn't bother me.  It's just that goddamn rotten stench.
Sir, if someone is suggesting that I'm a lesbian, they're wrong.
I find this as distasteful as you, lieutenant.  But if it's on my desk, it's on my shoulders.  There's going to be an inquiry -- it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty.  You should prepare yourself.
Would you have the discretion to end it right then and there?
West?
Did you hear?
Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously question whether --
I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now...
Would I be the only one?  The only woman?
Gonna be visiting that all-woman's America's cup team in a few weeks -- If I were a gambler, I'd say Dennis O'Conner's days are numbered.  But they're in San Diego, so I thought I'd take a quick promenade of the base.
Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
Should probably ask him that.
Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
"G.I. Jane."  And which one of you told me she wouldn't last a week? Huh?
It's really "F. Lee Montgomery" -- but that gets whittled down to just "Flea."  For short, ma'am.
Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take your minis, hit the water.  Go, GO!
If you can't feel the other guy's pecker, you ain't in tight enough! I want nuts to butts!
She's an officer.  There's a higher standard.
Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.
You'll try what we tell you to try, O'Neil.  Go regulation.
The Chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday.  By 18-hundred he was gone.  Out of the Navy.
Maybe it's not my place to speculate on his private thoughts.  But I think the Chief knew that his way -- his world -- had come and gone.
Gotta situation here.  Where are you?  Stuck in traffic?
This has nothing to do with you.
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
I can't walk two blocks in Washington without hearing about "G.I. Jane."  You're all over the place, and whether you wanted it or not, the feminists are sizing you up for that poster.
Jordan.  You watch your ass.
And this class officer... "Wickwire."  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for...
What about him.
Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
And how do you know that?
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part?
It seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs.  Israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives.  They don't use women anymore.
Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you got it for?
"Dad."
She led us right to you.  That's no threat?
I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
No.
Show us where you are, Chief.
Hmm.  Let's aim higher.
Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...
Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day.  Know what I mean?
Audrey, you're too damned nice, that's your problem. Nice gets you nothin' in this town. You gotta be a killer to get ahead, you know what I'm sayin'? I'm sorry, baby, but you just don't got what it takes.
What?
Well, I can be tough if I want.
Lucy'd kill me if she knew.
But we can get to the west side faster.
And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
I have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to nature.
I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?
Speak of the devil.
This is not the place...
Mr. Caiman...
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
I don't think so.
I'll try.
That is when we will go in.
Where's Luc and Pierre?
It's Tatopoulos.
Right. The worm guy.  Can someone get those people off the beach?
Yeah, you're the worm guy.
You're standing on it.
That's right.
What do we know? It was first sighted off the French Polynesian Pacific. An area that has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests over the last thirty years.
Oh.
Why do you need that?
It's okay. I know her.
I'm sorry, sir, I was only-
Thanks.
Uh uh! What did we talk about?
Open.
Leadership....
COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
I played Richard III...
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
A boy comes to the door.
Yes you did.
By Grabthar's Hammer, this is true. 159	NT. LIVING ROOM - SOMEWHERE - NIGHT	159
Okay, that's where you want to be.
How did you come to that conclusion?
What?  Up?
Yes?
I...Well, uh... Yes, absolutely.
You... know us?
Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
Guy... You probably don't remember me do you?   I was on the show in '82.  Episode 31?  Got killed by the lava monster before the first commercial?  "Crewman #6?"
Where'd they go? Back inside?
You smiled at me.
Oh come on, it's not like I haven't-
I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
No, I don't think so... Wait. They're not but...  Something is.  Oh my god.
Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
I... certainly, but-
It was a lot of fun. You kids are great.
... Maintenance facility...
Our former Commander was not... Strong.
Former Commander?
It's the Tothian mine field left standing from the Great War of 12185.
It's difficult to... On our planet we pretend in order to... entertain.
Wh... Where are we?
It doesn't have eyes.
It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
Jason? What about me? What do I do?
Because they're coming right at us.
Fire at will. hI~D  NT. PROTECTOR
You seem pleased by the prospect.
Exceedingly.  Besides, if I had half the wagons that were used to lug the rum to Philadelphia for this congress, I could move a whole army to the moon!
I've come to report that we've had a bit of luck!
Why in hell would John do that? Why in hell would any of them do that?  After all you've done, it's unbelievable!
The man's waiting for you to get wiped off the stage so he can become commander and chief.
Then, I need you.  We all do. Without your victory the men would have no hope at all.
Well... I misunderstood, then.
No.  I guess.
What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in?
Well, sir, then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear.
To learn to shoot cannon?
The last I heard, a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on Breed's hill.  With one stroke the British could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it.
Hancock led the Boston 'tea party' because he's a goddamned tea smuggler!  He wasn't protesting inequality, he was eliminating competition.  Now, you listen to me:  we need to get a Southerner elected commander-in-chief, or the south will not fight!  What have we been struggling for all these years?  For this moment!  And, if we fail now, remember:  you stopped us!
He has the soul of an aristocrat who'd like nothing more than to become a king in the minds of the people!
The British army, sir!
Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...
What can he do?  The British have massive superiority.
No, I did not.  Really?  Well, what the hell is a deist, precisely?
Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
How can you say that?
The one with 'Philadelphia' spelled correctly is the counterfeit.
And how rusty are these muskets?
Sir, these are our finest firearms from the armory at Charleville! They are a gift from the people of France!
Chose another.  Any general worth anything should have a brace of horses.
General Lee, sir!
Get these men back in line!
When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then...
Is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men? It's damned condescending!
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
Yes sir, it's a wise idea...
George, I'm sorry.
Well, we must be who we must be...
And 'others', say... have you even read Locke, Vattel, Voltaire, Diderot...
Well, I hear 'The People'.  Indentured servants, freed slaves... escaped slaves.  The world's castaways.  And, my fear is, in the scramble for power that's coming, you will betray them.
An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big.
Come here, Farrah...
Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline?
What about him?
The money. Fuck. I gotta think...
Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way.
He's around someplace.
You can talk to me.
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep.
Who?
That's all there is to it, huh?
First you and me gotta get a couple things straight.
I can't do it.
You positive about that?
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
It's not the kind of thing you do.
Who is this?
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
Or else use your fucking imagination.
Yeah? Which terminal?
Whatever you want, Ray.
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
I'm in the movie business.
Something shouldn't be there.
That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.
I want you to.
Come on, Harry -– Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you, uttering a bad check. I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position.
So you don't work for the casino?
I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.
"Mr. Lovejoy"? That's the title?
The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back.
You don't even know these guys.
What do you get out of this?
They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
His shrink's trainer.
Don't waste your time, Harry. The guy's not much of a movie fan. Now c'mon, gimme the key.
Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.
Exactly. You either get it from the wife or out of your own pocket, I don't give a fuck. You don't ever hand me a book with a miss in it.
What happened? The pressure got to you?
Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas.
Okay. I'm listening.
I'm up twelve grand today.
How? By taking my money?
It's all mine.
Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
That's right. Three percent.
Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?
He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
Yeah, well Martin is known for his flipping. He flips over a script, and when the time comes to make a deal, he flips out.
Yeah. Right.  Listen, "Touch of Evil"'s playing near my hotel. You wanna go check it out? Watch Charlton Heston play a Mexican?
Then you've read it?
I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin.
And you think the movie business is any different?
You don't like Martin much, do you?
Really.
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.
He already knew it.
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
What she did not say was, 'I just loved the way the director moved the camera so much it made me fuckin' seasick.' All she cared about was that look. All she remembered was that look. And why do we remember things in movies? Because we can see them.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
Chili and me.
Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them, it not only heightens the tension, it adds a wistful element to their love.
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
What is the vessel name, registry, and present position? Over.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. The vessel Chimera was registered to The Dobbins Kirk Line, Halifax.  Nova Scotia. Date of commission day nine month seven year one nine three two. Over.
I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.
I don't care what, ain't nobody just gonna let us walk away with a ship that size.
Morning, skipper.
She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it.
Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under the waterline. I don't think it's a problem.
It just occurred to me I don't know your first name. All this time and I don't know it.
Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
Or uninvited guests.
I tell you one thing, we're not gonna be towing no ship now.
What're you crazy?
Oh yeah.
Right. Wednesday.
Threw a turbine blade.
I know I know, two ways to do anything --
But how long?
Hard to say.
Yeah, yeah.
So whoever did this might still be around.
Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
There's a charming thought.
He'd let you off at the nearest port, that's for sure.
Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways.
Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.
Greer?
What?
February first.
If it was a ship she hit.
Either of you seen Dodge?
Right here.
We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
How's that?
Supposing he wants to get bad with us?
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
What's this?
Look at me -- I'm not even listening to a word you're saying.
Who?
YES.
God, how horrifying.
Are you going to yell at me?
She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
I just buzzed him in.
No, really I --
Oh, all right... Party-pooper! Just let me put a few things away.
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
I'm not sure... I mean...  I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking?
Let me know as soon as you can, Enid. This could be a great thing for you.
You can count on me, sir!
But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!
I just stopped in to say hi.
Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
Why do you have that stupid poster?
Because if you do, I'll kill you!
I know, she needs to die immediately.
How perfect.
He better watch out or he'll get AIDS when he date-rapes her.
I know, it hasn't really hit me yet.
That lets us off the hook.
Okay, well here's yours...  "Who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken? Not this one! Stunning bod, very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer."
God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him.
Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
Oh my god, he just ordered a giant glass of milk!
I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're out of your mind.
Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade?
It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
If I promise you there's really a party with a lot of guys, do you promise you'll go?
No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos.
I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time.
You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
You're gross.  See that guy?
He gives me a total boner!
Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
...maybe we should be lesbos...
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
I can't, it's Seymour's birthday...  Shit! What time is it?  I have to go to the store! I was going to make him a cake...
I can't imagine spending money on towels.
Do you still want to do something tonight?
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
I said "great"...
Maybe an orange juice.
Just because.
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
Who does?
Five hundred.
Well why do I care about that?
NO!!!
I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything.
You think it's healthy to obsessively collect things? You can't connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff...  I'm just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers.
Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.
Oh, right...
I appreciate the offer but you really don't --
Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests.  I hate my interests! Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself?
These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think.
This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
What are you, a fry cook or something?
Yeah, but still...
Never...
I won't even dignify that with a response.
So, what happened?
Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...
What, are you trying to get rid of me?
I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --
Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late.
Well forget the art show... let's do something else.
So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
...What do you mean?
Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more.
Yeah, sure. Of course.
What about Joe?
I guess I probably used to when I was your age.
Right.
He has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody!
Yeah.
Talk to us about it...
It's a "found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.
Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
That slut!
What are you talking about?
You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
Starling?
And it worked?
Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead.
Then why do it?
Nigel and I don't like each other much.
-well, it's just...  ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
We know three things about man-eaters. First, they always return to where they've attacked before. Second, they're always old- they can't catch other animals so they turn to us. And third, they're always alone- they've been cast out by their pride because they can't keep up.
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
What?
So that's what a lion looks like. 
-far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now.  There's even less of him than of Singh.
Got me out of trouble.
That's very considerate.
I'll have to.
I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
The workers don't get on?
Oh yes. But it takes time.
You've known him long?
You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
I don't care who he is.  He's not taking my baby.
I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.
Thank you, Frank.  I'll get the hang of this eventually.
That's exactly what you said last week.
You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?
I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional.
There's no doubt about it.  He's got his father's looks.  The kid is ugly -- extremely ugly.  And smelly.  You stink!  It's just horrible.  You are the stinkiest baby I ever smelled.  What's his name?
You're really good, you know.
I'll get Ray and Egon to check out the bathtub.  You better stay here.
For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me.  If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment?
Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century.
So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
Same difference.
Now you're talking.
Ghostbusters.
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong.  I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?
Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.
Maybe they just want to appeal.
Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.
Hello, Venkman.
I don't even want to know where that is.
They love you, Lib.  Keep it up.
His nickname is "The Hammer."
It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source.
That's it.  It's on the bottom.
No, the slime is rising.
Relax.  We're going to keep this whole thing nice and quiet, low key, no profile.
I guess so, Pete, because that's not all. Tell them what else we've got, Egon.
Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?
You finished here?
Wonder what?
It's okay.  I have my Senior Lifesaving card.
Miss Blue Blood?  Her family's been here since the year 12.
I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
Well, thanks a lot.
I thought I turned it off.  I guess I forgot.
Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
We'll get back to you.
Is that a game?
Die in what sense?
Yes, sir.  Don't worry.  We handle this kind of thing all the time.
Great!  How's it going?
And may I see this storage facility?
Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
See!  They are using drugs.
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
Wow!
Didn't see anything,  Didn't get anything. Nice girl - no ghost.  I'm starting to worry.  You said your graph was pointing to something big.  You told me things were going to start popping.
Don't cross the beams.
All right, Peter.  Good night.
You talked to Gozer?
Easy ... Easy ... I'm going to throw in my trap now.
Neutronize.  System shut.
I'm worried, Ray.  It's getting crowded in there.  And all my recent data points to something big on the bottom.
It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
For what purpose?
To go into business for ourselves.
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
Maybe.  But no one ever advertised before.
It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation.
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
Who was the architect?
Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
And the seas would boil ...
Judgement Day ...
I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house!  If it's worth something then sell it!
If I may be so bold...
Why not do it in the Colosseum?
You can't do that!  You came here to turn the crowd around not make them hate you.
Yes?  Go on!
Or perhaps into a new one.  But here's to your God and the courage of our legions...
Caesar?
Ignore that?!  The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
At the opening of the month of Janus, I will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship...
I'm serious.
We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.
He left us at dawn.
I met with Falco, and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce with the Germans.
He must have been.  He was on the list of prisoners to be executed.
I'm mentioning you in tomorrow's athlete's section, legate.  So, I'd love to know your birth sign; it effects how people bet.  And perhaps you could tell me a bit about... well, who are you?
Only from a distance.
Without him.  He'd be weeping if he overheard that.  Well?  The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.
But you do exist.  Narcissus:  hero of the battle of the Danube.
"But what if I wish to be purple?"
Hidden.  Where my brother cannot place hands on them.  He didn't have the guts to watch them die so... I took care of it all.  The sooner he is put out of our misery, the sooner will they be safe.
He's like you, sir, too tough for the Gods to swallow.
They fear me.
Let's hope he doesn't start giving orders.
Well, they die for it!
The battle is over.  The war is over.  You've won!
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
What you don't want to imagine is the things I've done.
How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...
Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
Death is a very light thing for you.
I refuse to be your slave.  I refuse --
So I pretend I'm dead.  You get gold, what do I get?
As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
I want nothing to do with the arena.
But, Elaine --
I just want to tell you something.
No. What I mean is -- that's why I've been acting this way. I'm not like this. I hate myself like this.
Isn't there one in the Taft Hotel?
Benjamin -- do they know you?
I do.
You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
Oh my God --
I've never been to it.
Oh. Well, I haven't either. I might just ride out there with you.
Here? In Berkeley?
Because it isn't true.
Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
Oh no. He said that.
Where did he do it?
The day after tomorrow?
Is the doctor anywhere?
Okay. Enough said. That's a deal.
I am going to call the police now.
Could you bring it up?
Look -- I was thinking about that time after the party --
Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
What? Oh -- no -- I'm just --
The Singleman party, sir?
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
A single room or a double room?
Please wait till my husband gets home.
No.
Yes.
What do you mean?
No.
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
No.
We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
Very much.
Will you unzip my dress?
Won't you unzip my dress?
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
On that chair in the hall.
Get away from that door.
Thank you for taking me home.
Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
Do you want to get it now?
Why don't you get it.
Yes?
Yes?
Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
Who said it was my first time?
Oh.
Go ahead then.
I don't.
No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
I got up.
There isn't any.
Always?
What?
No we don't.
How many times a year.
I don't.
I mean it doesn't sound like it could be much worse. If you hated him at least you'd hate him.
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
Think real hard, Benjamin.
All right. Now let's get to bed.
Not particularly.
At college.
Oh my God.
No.
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
But why shouldn't I?
You're not.
Are you?
Oh no.  Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.
This is absurd.
Where is Elaine?
Sir?
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
What else?
No.
-- then I'll simply invite all the Robinsons' over for dinner on Thursday.
I don't know. I want it to be --
Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
No. I think you'll want to wait on that.
Ben -- how old are you now?
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
Thank you.
Great.
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
That's quite a statement.
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
Yes, I can.
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
That what he says. Right?
You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
You might find a bullet through that head...
Oh -- work!!
Money -- Ever heard of it?
Too bad.
Poor child --  I wish I were free tonight -- we could --
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
Really?
Anything for you.
You live here?
And Baron, thanks so much for everything.
What do you want here?
I'm afraid not -- I usually do just what I feel like doing at the moment.
Go away. Who are you --?
I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
Just for a minute then.
What can you see?
I want to be alone.
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school, it was a monastery, I learned to pray and lie -- and ---
And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all.
Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night. 
Shall I see you again?
I can't.
No?
No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls. You wear them now...
I'm Baron von Gaigern.
Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- I am --
In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?
If the Baron -- if you would permit me --
All right then.
Yes -- but the audience.
I did not ask your advice.
As you will.
Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief.
No -- letters to two-eighty.
Mr. Preysing -- one sixty-four.
Anyone asked for me?
Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
You are ill.
Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk -- feels so nice on the skin... a London hat, see -- made in England, that's silk, too -- fifty marks... Look, the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron.
What, Doctor?
I was sent as a military surgeon to South Africa. Stinking climate. Taken prisoner. Home on parole not to fight. I was a surgeon in the Great War till the end. Grenade in the face. Carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound until 1920. Isolated two years.  I've been everything.
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
Yes -- that --
Oh -- you would!
Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
Then why did you have anything to do with him?
What?
It's agreed -- I will get a room here for you.
Here, hold up!
Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name?
I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --
You've decided against the merger?
I've admitted that at one time we had reason for desiring ther merger -- What reason have we now? The Preysing Company has fallon upon evil days, very evil days.
In that case give us the articles. We'll sign at once. We know all the details...
Good morning, Madam.
In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses.  Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette.
The house is not full -- Is it really full?
The performance -- the performance -- the performance. 
That theatre -- half empty -- dancing for those few -- I was frantic -- I finished -- the last beat and...  ...I waited -- I listened -- but the applause didn't come -- nothing. A man in the box -- and just the claques behind -- it is passed, Pimenov. We are dead -- it's finished.
But when did he go? How do you know?
You're discharged.
-- We must do something...
The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.
Did I say I wanted a cheap room to live in -- when I came here did I ask for a cheap room? Did I?
Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz.
The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?
But the situation is perfectly clear, If you will allow me -- 
No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on... 
What you need is some relaxation.
What do you want with her?
Bluff does it, Preysing, bluff does it. Goodnight.
Tell me about the oranges, Lilly.
It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh...
Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.
I like you, too.
These machines -- They're in here.
My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed.
Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo.
Take two, three days. Call when you get there.
But they must be! They cut glass!
Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars.
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman.
Just myself.
I don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. The idea is, we'll top it by fifteen percent.
I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
Thanks, uh, Lilly.
Don't mention it.
Sure.
He let me live. He let me be his friend.
You, too, Roy.
This way's perfect.
You've already made a start. Doesn't look that clean, though.
You must have some money.
A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this.
I don't see why not.
That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes...
I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
This time...
We'll work something out, Joe.
Scram. Go home.
Look at me.
You called the doctor, huh?
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
I'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that.
I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.
Myra, I'm not following this.
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
I thought these people were broke.
Sure.
Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
Sure. I'm pretty tired myself.
Oh, come here.
Running your broker scam, you mean.
No! Because I --
What?
I'm happy the way I am.
Gun?
I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.
They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
That don't match either of the victim's.
No blood on the knife.
I can be real stiff.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
My god...
It's not historically accurate, that's all.
I think someone broke into my house.
Checking out your place.
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top.  Somehow his opinion doesn't count.
The dorms are only fifty feet away.  You could practically see into my window.  So, what difference does it make?
Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
No.
John...
Please, get on the bus...
Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
I borrowed it.
I came to see you.
Alright.  I'll come out.  Just be quiet.
Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
He's my brother.
I can't believe this is happening.
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
Where's Shane?
But I've seen him!
He says things.  Bad things.
Okay ... But just for tonight.
You can't expect us to stay here --
Danny, you're just going to have to wait!
There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another storm.  Try to get some sleep.
Kids are what's ruining this country. Everywhere you go, it's the same.  No goddamn respect.
I've come to help your family.
What makes you think he'll come here again?
This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.
Halloween.
Kara, no!
That's the whole idea of living in the country.  I thrive on the seclusion.
I'm here now, Jamie.  You're going to live. You have to.
Any word on the location of the Strodes?
Sam, you know you never fail to amaze me.  Yesterday happily retired, today right back in the thick of things. Somehow I knew you still had it in you.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
Why did you take Jamie?
Jamie's baby ...
And I'm its deliverer.  Its calling card, if you will.  I follow it.  Protect it. Act as its guardian.  In a sense, Sam, so do you.
No, Dr. Loomis.  She's not the last night.
It's a bitch.
I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
Home is important to a man.
Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
At least!
I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
Can I have the Cadillac?
I sure didn't expect her to drop dead.
First Nagasaki--now this.
Really?
When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  To our women.
You're so low!  Look at that beautiful red meat.  You haven't touched it.
You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
Shut up, you ninny!  You were never to come here again-- for any reason whatsoever!
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
You never played a violin.
You did?
They were enemies.  We were at war.
You've come to the right man.
It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising.  It was a form of chemical castration. We became two more sleepy Indians.
I've considered that.
I'm interested in long-term expectations.
Things.  Oh--you silly people and your things.  Things, things, things.
You're my buddy.
Are you--do you--
The doctor was called away on an emergency.  I think it was birth.
Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
He worships Father.
College!
What's good about that?
Dad was never in England?
Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet?
Go on.
You're supposed to get hurt!
You're a very good boy to respond that way.
Go ahead.  No, no, no, no.
Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?
Mom?
Gee whiz, Dad--
Too late!  It's man to man now. Protecting your mother from me, are you?  Protect her!`
Everybody simply evaporates!  There are guest issues to be fought out here--or to be argued, at least. The enemy, the champion of all who oppose me, is in East St. Louis with his mother and his aunt!  I have so far done battle with a woman and a child and a violin.
Sir?
Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
Daughter--I love you very much.
You'd better get Dr. Woodly.
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow.
She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!
You're wrong.
People don't use that word any more.
You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you!
I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.
And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge.
And what is his most cherished possession?
Yes.
I don't think so.
That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
It isn't a matter of liking.  It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back--for anything.
You feel I've done a dreadful thing--leaving him?
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
Action!  Interaction!  Give and take!  Challenge and response!
You're begging him to kill you?
No you don't.
If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
What a handsome word.
Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
There it is.  Give it to me.
Load it for her.
Gentlemen--that's nice.
She still has just the one child-- the boy?
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
I came back.
We have, have we?
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
You haven't heard me yet.
We'll find out now, won't we?
You're old--so old.
Comical?
You hope.
In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
Cut me open.  Find out.
With spittle?
I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.
Oh God--you're really going to kill me. HAROLD It won't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee.  Heaven is very much like Paradise, they say. You'll like it there.
Get up.
I dunno.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I did.
Alice is dead?
Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?
Never mind.  It's a dumb theory.  I was going to say it was all sexual..but everything is sexual...but alcohol.  Peace.
I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didn't you say so?
All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.
A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
You know she has no feet!  You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet?
I didn't know that.
A lot of people don't.
I don't really know.
Shivers and sweats and groans.  His teeth chatter.  What'll we do?
You're going out?
I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?
He is my father.
Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
Yeah.
For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.
Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?
What?
It is?
He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old.  Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul has not gone into the park!
I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
Why would you do that?
To show myself how brave I am.  The issue's in doubt, you know--since I'm always for peace--
I'm amazed.
If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that.
You can believe that if you want. I talk to guys like you, and I want to commit suicide.  You get that weight-lifting set I sent you?
I feel like I've been double- crossed.  If you'd just told me it was Harold's birthday--
Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...
Do you have any particular choice of girl?
Well, I want to...
Cops aren't allowed to do that either. A judge ruled that that was entrapment. Don't ask me why. I guess he figured the sight of a Vice Officer's dong would make a girl unable to stop herself.
I said I just wanted to talk to you...
Pavonine. It's the same tint as the stripe in the fabric.
If you say so.
Too bad. I wasn't in it.
Nah.
Tod might know.
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
No.
A friend.
Not very.
It's an anagram. It comes from the Canons of Dort. Every letter stands for a different belief. T-U-L-I-P. Like -- are you sure you're interested in this?
So it's already worked out. The fix is in?
You really believe all that?
Yeah.  Well, mostly.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Just a second. It's my ass I'm risking. You better do it my way. These fuckers don't mess around.
Who's paying you?
That's like a stag film.
Get out!
Yeah, sure.
It's just a name.
But I'm here to help you...
Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
Pretty good.
How did you find me?
I called every L.A. hotel. The Holiday Inn gave this as a referral number. Your office said you had no business in New York, so I figured you had come out here.  What's happening, Jake? What are you doing? Nobody's heard from you. Anne's worried sick. We didn't know if you were dead or alive.
What?
Leave me alone. Go home. Go away.
That's not true, Jim. In fact, I think you're very close to the type we're looking for.
I thought you were quite good in it. I also like the girl in it. Really thought she was good.  I wondered if she was still around. If she was still working.
She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
What you got in mind?
Rucker.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You ain't goin' nowhere alone.
What?
They're all about the same. You want something?
I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.
But I...
That's all right.
What exactly do you have in mind?
I thought I'd invest in a film. I want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done...
It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?
Jake.
Okay. Keep in touch with my secretary.
You never heard of that?
I'll tell you, that was an interesting case. The Van Dorn girl. I've handled runaway cases like it before. Usually when you put the pressure on the porn underworld for an underage kid, she pops up in about a week. Everybody denies ever seeing her, but there she is at the airport with a prepaid ticket home. Well, I put pressure on all over town for this girl and it stayed cold as ice. In fact, certain people for this girl and -- nothing.  I guess I gave your brother-in-law sort of a raw deal.
I also want you to protect my brother- in-law.
Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble.
Isn't this your vehicle?
No, no. I just took it.
Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman.
You're welcome.  Did you know him?
Nice to meet you.
Oh, thank you. I think we shall be great friends, don't you?
What?
No.  I thought not.
Well, it's a new experience for me.  Good on curves. Shall I take you home, Harold?
Oh.
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
Oh, look! The birds.
Thank you, but I really have to go.
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
She seemed yare to me.
Really. Do you think it's wrong?
That's really great.
What do you mean?
Look.
But this is public property.
Is he all right?
An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
Look, the ice is melting.
What were you fighting for?
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
But I don't play anything.
Is he? Ah, the police. Always wanting to play games. Well, here goes.
The old double U-turn. Gets them every time.
Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello, Glaucus.
Why? There'll be a new block of ice in the morning.
You are the wisest person I know.
Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.
Maude, do you pray?
No. I'd feel stupid.
Where's that?
Well, be kind. I've lived a long time, Harold, seen evil as well as good, and it has been my experience that kindness...
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
I don't know. Perhaps.
You should have been a poet.
I took them out.
Farewell?
Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
But you're not going anywhere, are you?
I thought eighty was a good round number.
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
Well, I want you to go to bed directly after dinner. You know how susceptible you are to colds. Harold has always been a delicate child. Even as a baby he seemed to be abnormally prone to illness - Harold, dear, eat up your beets...
Mother.
Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
I'm getting married.
What?
A rough estimate.
Why?
None at all?
I'd have liked to talk to him.
What would you say?
You think so, sir?
It's the greatest excitement in the world.
To pit your own life against another.
Oh sure.
Yes.
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
Harold!
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
Well, thank you. Eh, officer, you might turn off the radio. Saves the battery.
Yes.
Julia.
I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.
What?
So you slept O.K.?
What do you mean?
WHY?
I KNOW I don't have to. It's just my time of the month to be a complete fucking idiot. O.K.?
I've got to finish it.
No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining.
Go on. But trick us again, child, and your suffering will be legendary even in Hell.
Nonsense, I...
Oooh!! Who was here? Nixon? Houdini? You mind sharing your mystic insights?
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
From where??!!
Grigory -- That's Russian, right?  Thought they were on our side...
Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
Well, I won't be around forever, you know?
That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
Oh, as opposed to -- ?
Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.  "Unique." That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here.
As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
On the desk, yes. In Latin.
Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years: He's barely out of his teens.
I knew those men better than you did --
I wish I could be more gracious but --
Each of us gets a belt.
My job.
Yes?
Just a scratch.  I wanted to see you.
Cocky.
A brute.
My uncle used to say... we like people for their qualities but love them for their defects.
-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
Just take it slowly.
Where's my father?
Lucky man.
Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?
It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
Kirsty?
What? What will you do? What CAN you do?  There's nothing to be frightened of.
Hush now. It's all right Frank's here.
That's right. Who are you?
I came for the wedding.
I don't want to see the dress.
Oh my God.
The Cenobites. It's only a matter of time before they find I've slipped them. I have to get away from here.
You're hurting.
Later.
Let me see.
So you were cheated.
And the blood let you out?
Well we can't just stay here --
There's a towel in the bathroom.
Just to your left.
Just a thought --
Ah!
It's just been empty a while.
No argument.
Just feeling a bit sick.
Oh, babe...
Sure.
Come with me then.
Please.
So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
Let's keep it that way, shall we?
No personal details?
What happened to me?
I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in?
Steve.
I'll come over and see you in the next few days. You can show me the mansion. O.K.?
Of course. Every day.
Kirsty.
I've forgotten.
I love you, honey.
What?
He's gone.
I don't believe it.
I see.
It's not what I heard.
It's a fetish of mine.
What happened to you?
Don't let them take me, Steve --
Sure. Why not?
I don't know.
Long time ago.  I was just thinking about her.  I was her first boyfriend.
I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
What's next?
I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
What did he ever do to you?
He offended me with his terrible taste.
I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
Ehh.
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
-- Barry, if I were to say to you I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet, what would that mean?
Just listen to me.  If I said to you --
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
How do you know about that?
Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?  You two have to stick together now.  Boners United.  United in getting some.
I didn't make up the name.  It's the Steely Dan song.  And it was in The Commitments.
That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --
No.  We need the gig.
No, you can't.
No, not nothing.  What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home.
Look if you can't think of anything, it doesn't matter.  I'll do one.  My five favorite from the old days at the Dodger.
Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a girl.
Look, I'm sorry about this, but I'd like "the Upsetter" by Lee "Scratch" Perry, in there.  Instead of "Sin City."
Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.  Listen.  Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man?
Great.  Gotta go.  See you then.
'Cause you like their second one, you said, Pop, Girls. etc.  The one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover.  You didn't see the cover though.
I think you know that.
Good.  So.  Is it my job?
I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.
Just the obvious stuff.
What, what?
I suppose so.
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
We'll talk some other time.
I guess.
We can meet for another drink if you want.  So I can explain it better. I owe you that much.
I figured it was.  Where are you?
You still together?  Going all right?
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
Ray.  I hate Ian.
I guess I am.
Mmnn.
C'mon.
I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
I didn't mean that.  I mean... was that all you used?
But what?
At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work.
That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.
I'm going to talk to you.
Hey.  It's Liz.
What's happenin'.
Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, "you know what?  Maybe it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." You know?
I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered.  Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo.  But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself.  And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know?
I'm sure it isn't.
Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
When I said before that I hoped it wasn't the end of the evening, I was, you know... talking about breakfast and stuff.
And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
Well call her mother.
Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
And I won't take a penny over ninety.
Whatever.
Maybe he's hiding from something.
Find the father.  That should clear things up.
Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this somewhere.
You're the expert.
There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.
It's my birthday.
Why?
Would you remember his name?
So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
Yes.
It's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years.
Probably.
Tradition.
Have you gone to the police?
Go home.
Not all of them.
The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in.
Yes.
I see.
My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity.
Damn you.
Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.
What is it you want?
Yes.
I'm just curious.
You're never "just curious".  You've met my neice, Brenna.
You and I should talk first.
All fashionably without heads.
It'll never stick.
You're an asshole, Moran.
Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.
Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
All I need is for you to check the name.
What are you doing man?
I should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation.  And a solution.
And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
First food, no?  A good meal makes conversation so much easier.
Pheasant.
In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.
This is madness!
You'd have to die first.  Aqui.
Hide.  Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn.  You must learn to defend yourself.  In this I can help.
Go to hell.
Oh, the boy has a mouth, now if only he had an arm.
You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.
I'll not take that kind of talk from you.  From those others below, maybe.  But not from you.
Like you.
Far away.
Certainly not me.
So sure?
I understand you joined up in Bremen.
You seem to understand a great deal.
Your father must be smart.
I don't know.
How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime?
It's all we have.
Steven, Conor didn't die.
Just your pappy scared some.
A double guard's been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings, railroad terminals, and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution.
Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
It will be perfectly all right, Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train.
If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.
Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
Bruce, you know I'm mad about you and stop talking like that.  Walter!
I'm Bruce Baldwin!
Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
That's right. -- Rubbers, too, I hope? A man ought to be prepared for any emergency.
I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.
I don't blame them.
Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?
Oh.  I wonder what's keeping mother? She was supposed to come down and get you.
Ts! Ts! Ts!
Say, I want to be sure, too!
You'll ask me to what?
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
We'll take a chance on that, Burns.  Go ahead, boys. 
Give me the District Attorney's office.  I'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the State penitentiary.  Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell. Come over to my office, will you? I've just arrested a couple of important birds and I want to take their confessions.
Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for?
I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us.
Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!
No!
I'm not working for any other paper!
Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
He's in the insurance business.
Now you got me.
No kidding?
Especially with an election coming up in a few days.
What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
We're not interested.
Never mind that. What's the story?
Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it!
Call him a love-child, if you want to.  Duffy!
All right, Walter.
What happened?
I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
Oh, for --  H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen!
Is this the Community Hospital?
Yes.
Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look --
Murder, uh?
Hanging an innocent man to win an election!
Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
Sure.
Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?
Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
Well, you're not too busy to know that the Governor hasn't signed that reprieve!
You said it!
They're always after me for interviews.
Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were here. No, Mr. Williams, we still have some questions for you. Sheriff, will you kindly extinguish the lights?
Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
I know, I just want to give him a thrill.
Don't you remember? He's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust, and gave out a statement that they were all sane. It created a sensation!
Who's this guy she's gonna marry?
Well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter.
What's the dope, Sheriff?
Where is he, before we beat it out of you?
Good coffee, isn't it?
You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
Not this gun!
What?
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
Earl Williams. The reprieve.
The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration?
What do you mean -- through?
I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?
So do you what, you hoodoo!  And now, Mr. Pinkus, if you'll come with us, we'll take you over to the Warden's office and deliver this reprieve.
That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
Phone for you, Hildy.
What's the use of fighting, Hildy?
None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! You stuck Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet! Now, give me that wallet or I'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either! It'll be for life!
No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
Yes. Isn't she beautiful?
How'd you get here, Earl?
It wasn't the Lord! It was the devil!
What do you mean?
Ssh!
Yeah, I'm feelin' fine.
The City Sealer's office!
No, I don't think so.
You can't bribe me!
-- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun wouldn't work, so --
I give that marriage six months.
Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself.
What's he want?
No, you're out, Grandpa. It's my turn.
But Grandpa, you said...
I only know one.
OK. You're in.
Not now. They wouldn't believe me.
Who with?
He's the worst liar.
It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart.
They've got the real thing outside.
Who pays for them?
Don't be so cheeky, Bruce.
I swear I don't know.  Here's your Christmas present.
Please yourself.
You need trees for an avenue.
Propaganda. We've been had.
And the bride.
We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
Just ignore her, Mac.
It's only a joke, Mummy. I'm fifteen. I'm still at school. I want to be a nun when I grow up.
How long?
Am I? Maybe I am.
Yeah, icky. This one guy stops and I look in and he's got his thing out waving it around like a drunk monkey.
Cool.
Things like that get a lot bloodier than ya think.
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
Oh, he was already gone before I seen him... but Tiny saw him and said he said he was going out to the yard to get a new wheel.
Where's that?
Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
Well, yeah, kind of.
Um, yeah sure, I guess.
Mmmmm, this is tasty.
Wondering what?
Now, what makes you think that?
Actually it's G. Ober... Gerry Ober, but the guys drew in the other O, fucking assholes.
Hey, wait take this.
A missing girl. I use'ta go to school with her, she just up and disappeared some day... real weird.
I figured that much. Why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for?
I don't drive cross country.
No, no I think it's really interesting.
Sqeaky! No way, she ain't that hot.
Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
Perfect.
OK, Boss.
Cat fight, cat fight.
Jesus, you think she was really gonna cut you?
She looks like a freak.
Whatever it is just do it. The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here.
And I gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... I figured what's the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.
Well, yeah... I think that if you knew him... I mean if you'd understand his urges, shit the guy's like forty or something.
Yeah, I guess I'll just help him hand out candy to the trick or treaters.
He tried to burn the house down, said it was possessed by the spirits. Tiny was sleeping in the basement where the fire started. I don't think Earl ever meant to harm us... but Tiny was badly burnt, his ears were destroyed and most of his skin.
I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
When?
Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up.
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
Someone is out there...  ...help, we're in here!
Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
I know, that was some crazy shit. I never in a million years would have believed it if I hadn't seen it.
Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
Oh, right.
Well, even though I know it seems childish to you all. Tonight is Halloween eve and it special to us so you are all invited to stay for dinner.
Where's Bill?
Let's go see.
Oh, alright... I guess I can trust you... being a man of the law and all.
No, I can't say that I ever seen 'em before...  ...he looks familiar, is he on TV?
Well, go get her.
I ain't got a warrant.
That must be him.
And think about what you've done.
I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no?
When you were a little French girl?
That would be good.
Yes. Happy happy.
Gabby, what is it?
Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
No! It is now that you must decide.  I love you, Doctor Nathan...  ...but I will not wait. I will not be your chippy. I will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish.  My love. I want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly... from you.
Unnhh.
Don't be silly!  And you were wonderful, too! I loved the way you said " au revoir."
Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.
That's Lila?
We still have you and I.
But I like being human now.
Yeah, well my brother is his shrink.
He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something.  Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with.
Lila, it's Rosie.
Your brother should have his license revoked.
No you won't. But it's okay. You have stuff you gotta do.
You are a therapist, right?
No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.
It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
You really enjoy my company?
You do?
Yeah  But I have some peculiarities also.
Why certainly!
Oh, and the sun block?
What SPF, sweetie?
I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that.  Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?
It's perfect!
Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?
Your entire body?
Shh. It's okay.  It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want.
Sure. Of course.
I've signed up for a ballet class. And look at my nails! A real girl!
Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.
Such as what womanly things?
Ummm. It's good.
Oook. Oook.
Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?
Unka unka unka unka unka.
Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?
I'm an ape, mom. I'm an ape. And apes don't drop lines.
Mm hmm.
Next game, ten bucks.
Packard. Sarah Packard.
I know. Been there myself. We've all been there, haven't we, Miss Packard?
To win.
You tell me.
That's the way it's done.
Deal the cards.
It's possible.
Twelve thousand.
Poker's not your game.
You bet he knows how.  You think that's a talent too, huh? Knowin' how to drink whisky? You think Minnesota Fats was born knowin' how to drink?
No, three thousand at least. He'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. That's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. He'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. But he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't count on it.
See that big car parked out by the fireplug on the way in? Well, that's mine. I like that car. But I get a new one every year because I make it my business to know what guys like you and Minnesota Fats are gonna do. I made enough off of you the other night to pay for it twice over.
Thanks for the drink.
That's a -- that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?
You think I can lose?
Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
Man named Turk Baker?
You know everybody, don't you?
You name the place, boss. I'll be there.
Miss Packard. How do you do?
What? And he -- he hustles pool?
No, no. When you play for me, I pick up all the tabs.
Play it again. Learn something.  Fats went in the john, see? Washed his face, cleaned his fingernails, made his mind a blank, combed his hair, came back all ready to go.  You were through. You saw him, you saw how he looked. Clean, all set to start all over again. Hold tight and push hard. You know what you were doing? You were waitin' to get beat. Flattened out on your butt, swimmin' around in glory. And whisky. Probably deciding how you could lose.
How're the hands?
You want me to tell her for you?
You don't pay me? You gonna get your thumbs broken.  And your fingers. And if I want them to, your right arm in three or four places.
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
You name it, we shoot it.
Want some free advice?
You well-heeled, partner?
Comes right in this poolroom every night, eight o'clock on the nose. Just stay where you are. He'll find you.
Okay... Okay. Nobody can beat you.
Eleven thousand four hundred, cash. Here in my pocket.
What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?
Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?
Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
What for? To play Fats again?
For who, Mr. Findley? ...Bert, he only beat me by one point. Now, you can't get off me now.
Charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please.  I'd show you to the door, but I...
Oh man, you're way out of our league.
How much are you ahead?
Couple of bucks.
Yours.
Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.
Can I buy you another drink?
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
Then why go to the bus station?
I used to be an actress.
Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.
Come here.
You want to go with me?
What, are you kidding? See that book?  I've been trying to get through that book ever since I first got here. I haven't finished the first chapter.  Did you read all them books?
What did all this stuff cost you?
Haven't you opened it?
From a rich old man who used to be my lover.
He knows. A lot.
First time for everything.
What do you want to tell me?
Come here. Come on, now.
He went off someplace.
I'm a little tired.
Yes sir, boy, they, heh, they say that old Fats just shoots the eyes right off them balls.
Now I know why they call you Fast Eddie. Eddie, you talk my kind of talk...  Sausage! Rack 'em up!
You miss?  Well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man?
Mm hm... Two ball, side pocket.
It comes back.  Flashes.  My name.
You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --
What do you mean?
Humans.
He wanted me to see -- he thinks I was -- infected by you.
Yes.
Virginia...?
Please.
I guess you could say that.
Round back.
This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
That's Mars.  The closest planet to us, now.  That's why it's more than just a point in the sky.
What, Jim, what?
Yes, Mr. Gardner.
Is that all he said?
We'll be very careful.  But we have to see.  If something landed there, there would be a big scar in the ground. Wouldn't there?
Maybe -- it landed in the bushes.
David, don't...
Haven't you been watching?
Remember I told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction.
You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.
And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
Spunky?
You punched the President in the face?
I can't shake her free.
We're being exterminated.
It had been deemed classified.
Well, er... it's slowing down.
Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
Dick-weed!
Oh. Sorry.
Don't worry, big guy. I'm sure she got out of here before it happened.
You're gonna break it. Just leave it alone. Here, take your medicine.
Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?
So far these things have not become hostile. For the moment let's assume they won't.  Connie, let's issue statements advising people not to panic, to stay home and take cover.
Many worlds...
Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?
Did you say...? Uh, uh...
The dog!?  You are named after the dog...
All my life!
The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.
Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.
I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
Not "supposedly," Doctor Jones.
Yes?
Except he's lost, and I'm not.
It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.
What?
Mine, too.
Knock it off. You're not mad.
Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
I can reach it. I can reach it...
It's important!
Don't worry -- I'm fine.
He was actually there? You saw him?
Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
...the solution presents itself.
Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
But what are they? Can't you remember?
I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
Good.
Relax.
Very well. I'm here now.
Thanks.
Who are you?
Just a routine inspection tour.
I remember first hearing your name when I was studying at Oxford. I am Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot.
Oh -- good. And maybe the present Maharajah is a little younger? And thinner?
A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
Sorry, I thought we were just talking about folklore.
Indy, they glow like fire and get real crazy! Then he talk in this real scary voice!
Two are still missing.
Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
They came from Palace and took sivalinga from out village.
Siam? But I'm not dressed for Siam...
Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
It was destined that I came here -- and the future cannot be changed...
Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off.  I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water.
A snake!
Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.
Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...
Yes.
Yeah -- this time you're gonna help!
What for?
Don't do that.
It wasn't him.
I just got here.
What street?! We're walking down QUEER STREET. We coming to Dopey Drive. We're about to be put somewhere quiet where they won't mind that we talk to ourselves.
...I need to make a phone call.
Do me a favor, Al.
You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything.
I'll talk to them.
Still clear. Just a motorcycle.
Then what are you stopping for?
How do you act when someone trys to kill you?
Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
You are CRAZY!
What do you mean we.
You gotta help.
Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
I'm not gonna make it easy.
Take a left and your next right.
Good. Get to a phone.
Just get there.
Are you screwing with any nerves?
You're out of shape.
What's happening?
Wait.
What?
Without your pants.
Not blue enough.
It lends you an air of mystery.
How do you know?
Can't tell. Every time I try her, you look away. Or you make noises. Maybe you don't want to know.
Not her. You!
What is it?
What if she says something important?
You get time off to sleep.
Osaka?
Run, stupid!
What do I do?
I know she's not with them. I know something else. What's bothering you isn't her.
Come on.
Well, don't let it. What are you doing?
I don't know.
Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
It's all we've got.
Good.
I know we fight, but I don't mean it. You're quite a guy. No one else could have dealt with this.
ya hyutn slulptsa?
I'll prove it. We'll repeat their procedures...put a man in our POD, bring it down, and then...inject him.
He's...more. Somehow, enhanced... He's...zxflbbgt!
Oh.
When you remember...
Right.
Take the card.
A little voice in my head.
Whatever it is, don't do it.
Nothing.
I am confused. Or maybe it's you.
...Rene.
I am sort of scattered.
You talk to yourself.
How often they come here?
What do you mean?
They kidded me a little.
Last night?
No.
This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
What'd he steal?
Too late, they won't come back out till morning.
He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
This going to work?
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
What'd...you forget?
Looks like they can. What did they do?
That I really don't know.
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
It wasn't me. It was him.
Like Al says..."Under stress, the human body is capable of impossible feats.
Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
You can't take that.
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
Yes.
What about Al...
Yeah? What for?
Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
Mom.
There's Dad, on TV.
Three hours.
Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.
Tell her I'll call her back in ten.
Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of "Kools" to the world.  "Sealed" doesn't hurt Scruggs' litigation, and since we're the only ones with the story, I believe we're sitting on an exclusive.
It's an alternate version. So what if we have an alternate version? And I don't think her being cautious is so damned unreasonable.
No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No.
No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
What caliber is your gun?
Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
Yes, it's on the stove...
I don't understand.
I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it?
I'm doing an interview.
No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
I have to take a shower.
What?!
Yeah.
What "Seven Dwarfs?"
No shit.
Who are these people?
What?
These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!
Yeah, that's right.
Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way.
This issue is a drop in the bucket. I can talk to you about what's in here. But I can't talk to you about anything else.
How much would I get paid?
To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
They're afraid of you, aren't they?
I can't talk about it. The work I was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. I don't know... it could have been beneficial.  Mostly, I got paid a lot. I took the money. My wife was happy. My kids had good medical. Good schools. Got a great house.  I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?
My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?
My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
Well, my father left us when I was five-years old. He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew... Let's get back to Brown & Williamson. If you decide to go on "60 Minutes," I got to know everything about why you got fired.
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.
I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
What?!
ABC...?
And I've got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before The Wall Street Journal runs.  I am trying to protect you, man!
Hello, can you hear me now?
I can't say that!
No, you can.  Tell him to get on the fucking phone!
You called me.
Where you staying now?
Our favorite hotel, honey... I checked into Room 930. Odd choice? Huh?
Mike's our Attorney General down here.  I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
You're saying that Brown & Williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia...
And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
"The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers..."
Chapter and verse.
Okay.  I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.
Here. Got pictures.
-- we realized we'd always been very attracted to one another.
And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
What part?
Mr. Dumbarton.
It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them...
Is she Asian?
No. I have the ring. Was I supposed to have a pre-nup?
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
You like kids.
Oh boy. If he only knew.
I told you. I was hungry.
No.
No. I haven't. Have you?
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
What is it you're after, Miles?
But why him?
Have you tried the duck?
I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
Miles?
Oh. And that is -- mom?
Huh?
No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.
Yes. Short notice you know, but I think there's nice closure to it. Hello Judge Muson. A pleasure as always.
I want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. That's all I've ever wanted.
Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --
May I come in?
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
Marylin!
Wait just a second there. You sent him here. You unearthed this pestilence.
I'm not leaving you. I took self defense
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
Dogs?
Marylin.
Are you alright? You lost weight.
Like I know his intention? Or yours for that matter?  I should join Sam. I'm too old for this bullshit.
So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
That's delusional.
Oh brother. Here we go.
Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe we're being too conservative. Seventy five percent.
Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
He never ate the pre-nup, did he!
She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup.
...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
But then... But then...
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
I don't know. I can assume...
Mmm... And to cut to the chase, forensically speaking -- is there a pre-nup?
I know that sounds rough but I'm about to close on a deal to develop some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged up to my ass. If this deal goes south, I'm ruined -- I'll lose millions.
Please -- let me handle this. Okay, Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your bottom line?
Berry spoons.
I'd stay away from her, Miles.
Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
And only two are hers.
It's not enough!  Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized. 
Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.
Because marrying that fool King Westley is—
Please. I can't fight on an empty stomach. Remember what Napoleon said.
South America!
We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
Stunt?
No.
Well, if it's as serious as all that—we'll move heaven and earth to—
Certainly!  Pay him off. He's entitled to it. He did an excellent job. Kept me thoroughly entertained. It's worth every penny he gets.
She hasn't had a thing yesterday—or today.
Yessir. She refuses them all.
Holy Smoke! I forgot all about that.  Send a wireless at once, "Lovington Detective Agency. Daughter escaped again. Watch all roads—all transports and railroad stations in Miami. Have your New York office keep tabs on King Westley. Intercept all messages. Want her back at all costs!"
You've got a good thing and you're hanging on to it, huh?  All right, You win. I'll just have to get used to you. I admit I'm licked. But only because I'm worried. I've had detectives all over the country searching for her. I've seen thousands of photographs. Fortune tellers, nuts, every crank in the country has written me.  Haven't slept one night this week. If I don't find her, I'll go crazy.
Oh, no. She'll be crazy about it. Well, see you later. I'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space.  Goodbye. 
I was gonna do it, but Ma wouldn't let me. She was ashamed, I guess.
Thanks.
All right, let it go.
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
Oh, yeah?
Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
That cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run!
Seems to me I've already thanked you for that.  What time is the next bus to New York?
I found it on the seat.
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
You must have me confused with—
Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.
Never mind. You know I had you pegged right from the start, you're the spoiled brat of a rich father. The only way you can get anything is to buy it. Now you're in a jam and all you can think of is your money. It never fails, does it? Ever hear of the word "Humility"? No, you wouldn't. I guess it never occurred to you to just say, "Please mister, I'm in trouble. Will you help me?" No; that'd bring you down off your high horse for a minute. Let me tell you something; maybe it'd take a load off your mind. You don't have to worry about me. I'm not interested in your money or your problems. You, King Westley, your father, you're all a lot of hooey to me.
What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
Oh, yeah? It's all right with me. Go on out in the storm, but I'm going to follow you, see?  Yeah. And if you get tough I'll just have to turn you over to your old man right now. Savvy?  Now that's my whole plot in a nutshell. A simple story for simple people. Now if you behave yourself, I'll see that you get to King Westley; if not, I'll just have to spill the beans to papa. Now which of these beds do you prefer? This one? All right.
Smart aleck!
I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
I thought maybe—uh—"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
Next week "East Lynne."
Then I'll fire you. I'll do all the parts myself.
I don't trust that chatterbox.
Why, haven't you—?
No.
You're crazy.
My uncle—Mother's brother—had four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggy-back."
What!
Thought you were hungry!
Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
Oh, no!
Well, it is simple. It's all in the thumb, see? A lot of people do it—
Now watch me. I'm going to use Number One. Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens.
You! Don't make me laugh.
Why not? I'm hungry.
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
Okay.  Cottage Number Three.
Who—me?  Want to see me?
Get out!
What time is it?
What's 'at?
Wait a minute, Gordon—I—
To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
That she's going to marry somebody else.
Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
Thanks, Joe.
If you ask me, I don't believe they're married.
They're married all right. I just seen the license.
They made me get 'em a rope and a blanket, on a night like this.
Yeah?
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
Said he was gonna stay a week.
Looks like it, don't it?  Here's the woman, ma.
Wife?
If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.
What?
I'd go fifty-fifty with you .
Why?
What's on your mind?
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
Yeah ?—How do I know?  I gotta good mind to plug you.  I shouldn't take any chances on you.
Nice guy. Just like you. But he made a big mistake, one day. Got kind of talkative. Know what happened? His kid was found in the bottom of the river. A rock tied around its neck. Poor Bugs! He couldn't take it. Blew his brains out.
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
Three, four.  He came in with a few Cubano swishes one time I remember...
I don't know how they got to me. Maybe cause I repped him here.  The Feebees run background checks.  On my mama's breasts, man, that's all I got.  There wasn't no conspiracy, Jim.  If there were, why the hell didn't Bobby Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney General, he was his brother for Chrissake.  How the fuck three people could keep a secret like that, I don't know.  It was Oswald.  He was a nut job.  Faggot, y'know, hated this country.
Bullshit!  Bartender, another round...  Here's to the New Frontier.  Camelot in smithereens.  I'll drink to that.
Get home my ass.  We're going to the office, have another drink.  I want some company tonight.
Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember.  Stick to what you can prove in court.
Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
Who gives a shit what he calls himself?
No, you're awake, Bill, and I'm dead serious.  And we're going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from three years ago.  How did you find out Dave Ferrie drove to Texas that day?
Gee, thanks boss.
It went to the goddamn FBI and they didn't find a goddamn thing.  It comes back a week later and one guy in the Dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all I know he could've taken off Oswald at the morgue.  There's no chain of evidence, Bill.  And what about the tow guns actually seen in the Depository?  One an Enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a Mauser, described by Deputy Weitzman... Maybe, just maybe, Lee Oswald was exactly what he said he was Bill - "a patsy".  Take it at face value.  Lou, Susie, I'm going with my gut here.  He's got an alias of Hidell to buy the rifle, "O.H. Lee" to rent the room, right?  What's in a name, right?  In intelligence, they're assumed to be fake.  A name is sort of like a postbox number, a code - several different people can use the same name, right?  Then why can't somebody be using Oswald's name?
Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson was involved?  The President of the United States?
I don't know who to trust anymore. Yeah, sure I could use a pot of hot coffee and a few packs of Camels. You got anything new in the investigation?
I don't have much time.  They don't even need bugs anymore.  They got these fuckin' satellite waves.  They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes.  He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment.  A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother.  You'd never believe half the shit the Agency does.  I'm so fuckin' tired.  Haven't slept since that shit article came out. Why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this?
I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds.
Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
Why?  What's wrong?
Same one.  I didn't know no impersonator.
Shaw's an "untouchable", man - highest clearance.  Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency.
No, because there were others.  There were admirals.
There were admirals.
Sure it is.  Freckle Face, if I ever handled a minor felon like that, it'd be all over the papers.  I'd catch hell.  And this is the alleged murderer of the President?
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?
How many shots you say you heard?
...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
Presumably so he can now exercise his intellect stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.
I would imagine a uniformed waiter helps.
Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  As you well know.
Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the man you had in mind?
Naturally.  Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
You really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters, don't you, Mr. Garrison.
Please answer the question.
Of course not!  Such a pity, that assassination.  In fact, I admired President Kennedy.  A man with true panache, and a wife with impeccable taste.
Nonsense.  What next?
Now just a minute, sir!  You're way out of line!
I know, but Mr. Garrison, the FBI is just not doing their job.
These books are getting to your mind, Mr. Garrison.  I wish you'd stop readin' them.
My sympathies.
Get a hold of yourself.
You and your government!  What's the matter with you?  Don't you have any feelings?  Your daughter!  What kind of man are you?
You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm taking the kids to my mother's.  I am - I am.
Huh?
Bring on all the motherfuckers! Bring their college degrees in here! I got nuthin' to hide.  They can't buy me.  You can't buy me.  I don't even need the parole.  This is about the truth coming out.  You're a goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you don't know shit, cause you never been fucked in the ass.  Fascism is here now, Facism is...
What are you driving at, boss?
Between six and seven seconds.
We need him back.
You think there were other men involved, Russell?
Some people would say you're paranoid.
I'm not with the Agency, Mr. Garrison, and I assume if you've come this far, what I have to say interests you.  But I'm not going to name names, or tell you who or what I represent. Except to say - you're close, you're closer than you think...
I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.
I keep thinking of that day, Tuesday the 26th, the day after they buried Kennedy, L.B.J. was signing the memorandum on Vietnam with Ambassador Lodge.
More than ten years.
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
Okay, you handle it, Numa.  I don't have time for this nonsense.  We've obviously got the bastards worried now.  I'm going to Washington.
The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
Virginia or Elizabeth?
Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
Then you don't stand a chance, Mr. Chief Justice, you have a lost cause. All I want is a lie detector test, and you refuse to give it to me. Because as it stands now - and the truth serum - how do you pronounce it - Pentothal - whatever it is. They will not give it to me, because I want to tell the truth... And then I want to leave this world.
Not a problem.
Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
That's not what they're tellin' me.
That's why they call it "fuckin' with ya." Now you wanna hear how we retaliate?
I need a favor.
Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?
I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.
How'd you know where he was?
That looks like fifty thousand dollars from here.
She wants to make a deal.
She wants to go back to work.
You have the right to say "no." And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. And if I don't want to go through all that trouble, I could just take you in on suspicion.
While you're at it, let me see what else is in there. You mind?
'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
Can you do it or not?
Okay.
I'd love one, but not there.
Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico. They're hard to find here. I was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat.
Sure.
Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that.
They wanted you to tell them what you know.
I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
Same as you. Ten thousand.
Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.
Yeah, if I cooperate.
I got a few. But I can't afford to start all over again. I got too much time and money invested in my records.
'74, I think.
It's nice.
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
It's not really something I think about.
It's different with men.
"American President"
How was it?
Right around here, in the food court.
You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
You're avoiding the question.
Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
That's my job.
Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
It's not that simple.
Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?
He say is a surprise.
Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking to you.
Yeah?
I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity.
You two meet?
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
Uh-huh.
Oh, that's taken care of. I called the State Attorney's Office. You were no-filed this morning in Circuit Court.
I was told ten thousand in each pack.
That would be one point of view.
She didn't give me one. I told you before, Melanie wasn't part of the plan. Ordell must of told her to do it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping bag, and takes off. What am I supposed to do, go after her? I'm in my fucking underwear. I had to get dressed before I could do anything. So I put this back on 'cause could put this on faster than I could my uniform.
You took the time to pay the saleswoman.
Not in the fitting room.
Do you think I took some of that money?
Better get me another Sam's.  Join me in a Jaeger shot?
Uh-uh.
You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess you have to trust him.  I'd have second thoughts on that, but then I know 'em.
So tell me. Having all that money in your flight bag -- Is it tempting?
You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?
I didn't tell 'em anything.
I been thinkin about that, too, and I got me a idea.
Talk to you tomorrow.
What did they say?
But you don't?
What'd you care?
Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
What does she think she's gettin?
Where you gonna be during all this?
How long?
Bank robbery.
No thanks.
No.
So what are you trying to tell me? I should get out of here?
No.
He went to meet that stewardess.
Uh-huh?
Yeah, down the end.
You sure?
Guess where I am?
C'mon in.
I'm in my underwear.
Who was Beaumont?
Yeah.
Over half-million dollars worth of merchandise.
That's what I gotta tell you. She bugged me the whole time. Got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag. Started running her fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. "Is it this aisle Lou- is, is it that one?" She was totally fuckin' with my nerves.
Pull the car over.
Or...  ...she gave it to somebody else first, before Melanie went in the dressing room.
Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other?
Haven't a clue.
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
The bond for possession is only a thousand.
It still sounds high.
If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit.
Looky here, I know you helped her and I know you know what I want. Jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers. Long as at the end of that story, she hands over my money. She do that, we're still friends. Now, she don't wanna be my friend no more, tell her to think about ol' Louis. And if she tries to turn me in, I'll name her ass as my accessory. We'll go upstate together. Hand in handcuffed hand. Now that shit's a promise, understand what I'm sayin'? You tell her that, and I'll call you back.
I thought you might be asleep.
You keep fuckin' with me, you're gonna be asleep forever.
Git your ass in here.
And you did that to protect my interest?
She's been there since Thursday night.
It's in the safe. She can't get at it.
Call her, tell her the combination.
I'm telling you, you got her spooked. She won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone.
I call your office, she better answer the phone.
Yes.
He's around.
I'm alive.
Then what are you doing here?
There is no out of here. You've been killed. Don't you remember?
Just to see you. That's all.
Well, how do I look?
Hello, Sam.
Short? It's ended.
Now what?
Don't go?  I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here, Gabe.  Come on, go back to sleep. You can still get a couple of hours.
Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you?
It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.
He told me he was going to Hell.
I say you should get a shrink.
How do you know?
She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
She hates me, Louis.
I don't know. I've been having them recently.  You know, you look like an angel, Louis, an overgrown cherub. Anyone ever tell you that?
I was in Hell. I've been there. It's horrible. I don't want to die, Louis.
Well, I'll see what I can do about it.
You ever read Meister Eckart?  How did you ever get your Doctorate without reading Eckart?  Good. Okay, let's turn over gently. Right side.
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
I'm walking, aren't I?
No.  I see them.
Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves.
This is healthy? I'll probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy.
Don't ask.
Maybe you left 'em in the bathroom.
Why you left.
I don't like things that make you cry.
I enjoy crushing into you.
Get your clothes off!
Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
In a way. At least now I have some idea of what was happening. If we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... I don't know. Maybe it'd clear things up in my head. I'll tell you something, Jez, honestly ... I thought they were real.
While you were in the shower.
What? What do you mean?
I don't believe this.
Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what?  Vietnam? ... What experiments?
Are you out of your mind?
Where are they?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
You look upset.
You look terrible. What happened?  Jake ... is it the antidote?
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
Never?
Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back.
Yeah, you and everyone else.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Paul Gruneger!
Count 'em on one hand.
What do you mean, not enough time?
What if we blow the walkways first? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship?
Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.
I think I broke my arm.
Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.
This is gonna work. If he sticks to the program. Will he? Stick to the program?
Then stop talking and work faster!
You're a teacher.
What if they're carrying? Did you even check?
Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.
Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.
JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?
No, you're dead! You're all dead!
Not an option. I'm going to hunt this son of a bitch down.
Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!!
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
We have to get off this ship.
What if we don't?
I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women.
Just come on, I've got an idea.
They'll make it.
That ought'a help the situation.
Let's just get out of here.
So what else is new?
Barbie from hell...
I'm afraid I cannot assist.
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
I just know.
Keep trying!
Then open the doors!
Thirty seconds.
4You're not going anywhere.
He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!
All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him...  ...along for ballast.
I almost had 'im.
He's taken him!
Don't be silly -– You're going to make summer better for them...
Here? You gotta be kiddin'.
Michael! Come inside!
I told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself...
No. Home here.
Why?
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake!
We towed Ben Gardner's boat in, Larry; he was dead and his boat was all chewed up.
It's a whale out there.
You from around here?
Some friends and me took a house.
We never had any. What's the problem?
What else could've done that?
I do.  But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere.
Anti-Shark cage.
Down here, Hooper!
Well, I'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. We depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished.
That's it! I'm standing here arguing with a guy who can't wait to be a hot lunch. Goodbye.
I don't think so.
Okay, cool.
The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.
We could get back together too.
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
I try really hard, actually...
That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
Can we make out now?
Yup.
Yup.
Well, there we have it. Would you like to know the sex?
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
I would never barf in your urn, Brenda. Maybe L.B. did it.
Well, I'm not ready to be a mom.
You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
Yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva. I've made a lot of sacrifices for you, Juno. And in a couple years you're going to move out -- and I'm getting Weimaraners.
It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.
Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know.
Shut up.
Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob.
Tell me about it. I used to play in a really tight band back when I lived in Chicago, and one night we opened for the Melvins... do you know who the Melvins are?
I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
Yeah?
I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
You're something else.
Why? What the big deal?
Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'
Why?
Cute?
I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.
Oh God, you're one of those guys...
You do?
That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.
Good. I'm good.  Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later.
No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by the way. He was very good in... chair.
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign.
Silencio! I just drank my weight in Sunny D. and I have to go, pronto.
I am a suicide risk.
Only the one in my pants.
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.
Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.
There are ads? For parents?
No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.
Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
Eww, he's all beardy!
Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
You don't make anything. It's for exercising.
They're yellow.
She answered our prayers.
Have you found a place to stay?
Adele for god sake please lis...
Could I try that?
It's a portfolio of my work.
Sure.
Early, you are so sweet.
Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn...  ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...
...I don't know.
Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
...Too bad.
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
You wanna hear mine?
No, it's all yours. It's on me... for saving my ass back there.
They picked up hitchhikers... young men... and brought them back here.
Just like that. Load up the Lincoln... point it West... stop when we hit the fucking ocean.
...I think it's the best stuff I've done.
I still think we should have met them first.
Beggars can't be choosers. They were the only ones who answered the ride share note, remember?
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
She wasn't feeling so good.
You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me.
Oh man... come on, I don't want no janitor job.
...That'd be my guess.
Umm. Altogether?
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
How many times have you gone unprotected?
You fucked it?
Oh man, that's the best.
Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.
Yeah.
She's probably smash you in the fucking face.
I don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I wasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. Show 'em some respect.
I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
You think he's got any herb?
Yep.
No, I'm serious man. I'm dead ass. Do you wanna try? We could be like the fuckin X-rated "Wonder Twins"!
Who?
Yeah.
Yeah. Why you give money.
Why not? You stink.
Hell ya. We broke that mothafucka.
Yeah me too.
Nuffin' G. Just forget it.
What the fuck yo? You wanna catch a beat down?
Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
Don't take a bath. Come swimmin' with us!
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.
Yeah?
But I'm scared Telly.
Nothing?
Oh man. You gotta see this. It's a spectacle. A real spectacle.
What do I want to do?
Why is that?
What?
Because gee, you don't look OK. I mean you're a very beautiful young lady. It's just that you look troubled that's all...
Yeah well, it's been a bad day.
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
No.
Oh hi Jennie. Do you want to come make out with me?
Telly's not here right now. I believe he went downtown. Casper too.
Boom!!! Boom!!!
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
I gotta find him.
Yeah. She should be at Nasa tonight. Why you lookin for him? You like him now or sometin'?
Making love is like.
I start thinking about what I'm gonna eat afterwards.
It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
Oh god. That's horrible.
Paul it's Telly. Open up.
Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
Yeah. I had sex with Jake, and it took him like an hour and a half.
Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.
What kind of problem?
What are you saying?
You are!  I don't like you.
I wouldn't know.
No it wasn't.
What if he doesn't bite?  What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
No, I need the original note.
I want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer.
No.  She just moved here last month from Portland.
She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.
You alright?
It's a voice modulator.
But a hundred men could move him.
It isn't him.  Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.
Why not?
What?
But you said you didn't know her.
Then call them!
I couldn't say it any better than Huxley.
What word did you leave last night?
Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds.  It's check, Peter.
Let me speak to my daughter.
Thanks.
Set up some pieces on the big board?
Have computer search for anyone that's used that opening against me.  There can't be more than a handful.
He's in his seventies and lives in Holland.
You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.
How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before.  This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.
Come here.
He was watching you.
He went down to the lobby for a minute. He should be right back.  Would you like come in?
Of course.
I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
For what?
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
Six, eight hours tops.
Bingo.
We're not sure.
But we heard him.
I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?
It can't be a coincidence.  The woman that owns it has a son.  She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days.  We're trying to locate him.  There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week.  We're checking that out too.
I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
Didn't you tell me that Debi Rutlege had just moved into her place also?
I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
I don't know.  I was afraid there'd be hours of questions.  I can't afford to miss a game.
Upstairs and downstairs in his night gown -- He could be saying the house he's picked is two stories.
I signed the confession.  What about the car?
I suppose you have something in mind?
Whatever's on your mind.
No.
Thank you.  I'm at 639-7393.
Because I love them, but they drive me crazy.  You know how parents are?
Chess is a reflection of life.  Life is violent.  The strong win.  The weak perish.
If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?
Why?
Because I think he's wrong.
You always want to talk about me.  What about you?
No.  You were talking about chess.
I said I didn't plan on getting involved.
Nothing.
--admit what?  That I was right about you in the steam room?  That you're willing to do anything to find out what you want?  Would you like me to leave so you can search the rest of the room?
Right.  Here!  c-4.
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
Well, you're beautiful.
Thank you, but I can wait.
Colwyn.
Colwyn. Colwyn.  I love you, Colwyn.
All the passages are guarded.
The new Queen lives.
I am too old to climb down a rope.
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons.
Darkness. Tunnels and corridors.  Wait.
She is too deep. The curved tunnel we saw is part of the Vortex, the place of The Beast.
No. She must agree of her own free will.
Never.
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
Let me comfort you.
He saved our lives.
What else is left for a man without friends.
Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?
You will follow me.
The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.
Go. I command you.
There's no way to outrun it. You know that. This is what Ynyr was preparing me for. It's what he died for.
No.
And what do you think a small person lives in, you one-eyed fool? Leaving me here to mope while you and the boy were arranging my assassination.
And mine goes with you.
Sugarballs?
I ...  ... am Titch.
I only want one.
And do you think I live on air?
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
No. He will master the leader.
Then look!
He will not!
He will not come. You will be my queen.
It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
I knew.
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
That I am, my lady.
Yes. We lost five.
How many did you lose?
With an old voice?
Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
We had no children.
You said nothing. You told me nothing.
Those are reflections.  <u>This</u> is my face!
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
Knowledge.
Come on, shit, tell me! Is he beautiful?
It's better...  You see, it's my turf, so I don't want contracts I'm not informed about, on my turf.  I'm not opposing, but the least they can do is informing me, isn't it?
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
Listen, think about what you want to do, but don't worry, your money is there and it's safer than in a bank... Banks are robbed every five minutes!
Take them, you never know... If you want to have some fun. Take, it's a gift.
OK.
Now, try a running guy.
OK.
I was nervous, that's all! Where is the guy?
What shall we do?
What do you do, with the money you earn?
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
It will take them five minutes!  How long ago did they arrive?
It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.
Can I sit on the stairways now?
Emilio? Due grappe!  ...Why the hell did you come here?
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
These guys have no place.  They change virtually everyday. And his name...  It's a surname.
I have new dreams now.
I finish the walk, and then we may take all the chances we want.
Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
A.P.B.... He isn't breaking any law.  He's a grown man... He can crawl on his hands and knees to China if that's what he wants to do.
We're very sorry about that.  Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
You need a ride, Preacher?
That's enough.
We operate.  We find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... I just did this procedure on a Senator and he's doing fine.
What are the odds?  Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
Pardon?
I'm going to ask you a question that may sound peculiar.
You have?
Well, I'm sure it's not Christmas, because you'd be worried about how much money we don't have to spend on each other... I know it's not New Years, because you'd be going on and on about wearing a tuxedo and how much you don't like to dance... and I'm sure it's not our anniversary, because I didn't find an envelope with a hundred dollars cash on my bureau with a note that says, 'Pick out something pretty'... Yes -- Maurice -- I'm virtually certain it's not a special day today.
Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
Anything?
Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night?  Are you going to show it to someone?
No.  But I want to take a walk with you.
It'll make it.
He's plastered.
The Gazette's small huh?
Write from your heart.  That's why the classics are great.
Walking where?
I always knew you had good instincts...  Goodbye Kris.  I'll see you when I get back.
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
She knew you loved her.
... The Grapes of Wrath.
What, come on?
I need your help.
Did you tell him everything you wanted to?  Did you do everything you could while he was here?
Someone should be with you.
Confused.  I'm not sure what to do now.  I'm not sure what he wants for me.
Hello.
Maybe you shouldn't stand in the road like that. You're pretty drunk.
Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately.
Of course.
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
Yes, that's right.
No, I can't have dinner with you.
Yes.
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
Me neither.
So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
Well... OK...
I tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me -- not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but I talked them into letting me walk you out.
Here's my speech...  ...I know this shouldn't be acceptable to me, but it is. Don't ask me why. I sense that your trouble is very big... and I'm scared for you... and so I'm doing what I think you need me to do. Falling down in casinos is little stuff. It doesn't bother me. It has nothing to do with us.
I think you should wear one at a time. One of these... and one of your others. In fact, I was going to buy just one, but I didn't think it would fly... as a gift, I mean.
Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
Yes. One of my friends was there. I wonder if you ever clipped her.
Yes... I guess I knew that.
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
Do I look that obvious? My name's Paul.
Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
I will keep you safe. We are both older.
I am lonely, Yuri.
Where have you been staying?
With an old friend.
No.
I loved him!
He was thirty-four years older than you. That doesn't sound so good to a jury.
Are we done for today?
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
I'm impressed that you took the initiative to go there and get it. That's what makes a good lawyer. And on top of that, you gained the client's trust and kept it. That's what makes a great lawyer. You're smart, Elle. Smarter than most of the guys I have on my payroll.
So everything you just said --
Aristotle.
You're asking the wrong girl. I'm with my guy eight years and then one day it's "I met someone else. Move out."
I couldn't help it! It was the most fun I've had since I've been in law school. Not only was I good enough for Warner -- I was better than him. He has to see serious I am now. Even Donovan was impressed, and he's a total hard-ass.
Which must be a nice vacation for his balls...
What's the point of staying? All people see when they look at me is blonde hair and big boobs. No one's ever going to take me seriously. The people at law school don't, Warner doesn't -- I don't even think my parents take me seriously. They wanted me to grow up and become a Victoria's Secret model who marries a rock star. Now, for the first time, it seemed like someone expected me to do something better with my life than wear underwear for a living. But I was kidding myself -- Donovan didn't see me as a lawyer. He saw me as a piece of ass just like everyone else. It turns out, I am a joke.
Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing?
Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you.
No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers.
She's completely untrustworthy.
We're here from Austen, Platt, Jaret & Donovan --
I can't.
That's not really a topic that keeps me up at night -- but maybe it should.
What?!
Are you sure?
Well, hurry up so you can come home! We miss you!
I do.
Well, in all likelihood, she's completely guilty as well. She was seen standing over her husband's dead body.
Elle, c'mon, there's no way you'll get the grades to qualify for one of those spots. You're not smart enough.
Really?
Are you serious?
Huh. Imagine that. Looks like I am.
Cunnilingus?
Fire moat... why do that?
You're magnificent.
Grotesque... monstrous...
You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
Not from me, surely...
No.  Now is the time for discipline. Some lessons in obedience for the future Baroness.
I can keep a victim alive for weeks... months, if I desire it... it's an art.  They beg for death... I keep it just out of their reach.  The pain remains constant.
Yes?
I didn't know... I --
Honeythorn Gump, is it?  I've not seen your ugly face since you sold me a jug of cow piss claiming it was dragon's tears.
Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark?
If you're looking for enchantment, Jack, that I can give thee...
Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
No less a creature than the Lindfarne Worm.
Now, Jack-lad, no one's asking ye to skewer the worm.  Even St. Michael'd have a job on his hands for all that.  But the serpent hoards a pile of booty, Achilles' armor among his treasures... if we find our way within the mound and him asleep...
Tricks, is it?  Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp!  I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk.
You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart.
We march on Castle Couer de Noir within the hour.
Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!
Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
Good plan that.
Better to kill than be disturbed.
Be gentle with them, Jack.  They only march to please you.  Were this a faerie journey, we'd ride the wind on thistledown and ragwort stems.
There's the way, mates.
Aye, lad... we've little else to go by.
Long as we don't lose heart, Jack...
Will you chance a miss?
That's it!
It's what we'll find there worries me.
It doesn't matter.
Nonsense!  Course it matters.
Easily... The question is, can we save ourselves?  Be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war.
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
Sunlight.
Never show mercy!
Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.
No, no, no... this is different!
They've fired the moat!
Or perchance...
Sport, indeed.
A gentleman would offer water.
I am a princess.  You have no right to order me about.
So, he's hiding in the dark...
Lili... I love you!
Nor can I.  Damn!  It's buzzing all around me.  Ouch!  I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!
I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.
Your fair smile be thanks enough. Better I stand afar to admire your beauty complete.
Dead, dead, dead.
What a fine meal you'd make, be the rest of you sweet as your tongue.
Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
No need for bells, Jack.  I'll nay enchant ye.
Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
You beware, Jack!  You and your porridge-pot heart!
Small miracles better than no miracles...
Or a kite...!  We could make a kite... Let the wind do the work --
We can work.
Oh.
What's wrong?
You'd better call and cancel.
He seems lonely.
Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys.  I hate nose rings.  And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.
I want you to try something with me, okay?
What did you think it would be?
I don't know.
He jumped into the ocean.
I'll get your back.
No.  That's okay.
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
Not really.
I don't wanna go.
Will he talk to me?
I mean, but did you both go camping on weekends?  Listen to music?  Masturbate together?  Talk on the phone?
A violation?
I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
For everything.
Well, it's the least I can do.
You're here early today.
You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
I did warn you.
You don't know what the deal is.  There is no fucking deal.
Why would you be there?
I'm not going!
Mom...please.
I can promise you complete privacy.
When are you going to be back?
You know that great thing, though?  Is that change can be so constant you don't even feel the difference until there is one.  It can be so slow that you don't even notice that your life is better or worse, until it is.  Or it can just blow you away.  Make you something different in an instant.  It happened to me.
We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father.
That's not true.
He's got nothing to do with me.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
Why wouldn't she leave?
I would have killed him.
Yes.
Here.
Isn't that weird?  I mean, I dated a little bit after my divorce, for four or five years.  Six years.  I know when my son was younger...maybe when he was ten or eleven even, he'd run up and wrap his arms around me.
Check the permits.  It was built as a guesthouse.  It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated.
You let him pierce his nose?
I'm not talking just physically.  Even your anger is perfect.
There's nothing anymore to stop me.
I love those doors.
Where will you live?
One of you would end up dead.
No, you don't.  Trust me.
That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
I'll say a lot of things I've never said before.  It's habit.
No.  Mostly me.
Not a perfect day.
You got any weed?
Don't even...I'm there.
She wouldn't even fucking go out with until she was sixteen.  I mean, that's not even a rule, just her own thing.  She like figures things out on her own and then that's it.
Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
I'll make you something.
Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
Lois will stay with them.  Or we can pawn them off on your parents.
Good.  That was the plan.  We couldn't stand him and George needed help.
So am I, Robin.  I'm working at something, too.  I'm even talking.  Do you want to be around for it?
I know.
I never asked for more.
That's the problem.
That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me.
Do you like red?
No.
Why?
In the bedroom.
Nagger?
That's my girl.
Hell with him. It ain't that.
You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
But you can't.
My name's Yvette. Sylvia sent me. You look just like she said.
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
Want me to come back some other time?
That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
He's right, Gibson. Put down the gun and we'll work this out.
Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
Sure, Claude, whatever you say.
That's because I've never been here before.
Did those two muscle heads shake you down? Swear I've seen them down at the track with Sure-shot Riley. That's it, ain't it? A gambling debt.
Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.
Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
No, tell me what's so funny.
The Negro League don't pay so good. And you're always on the road. That don't wash with Daisy.
Uh-huh.
What gave you that idea?
There are people down there having fun. I want to be one of them. I want you to be one of them. On Monday you can be a bank teller if you want, but tonight you're a bootlegger with a truck full of Puerto Rican rum and a fistful of cash.
Fuck that cheap-ass watch --  I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.
He just blocked it out. Nigger's crazy. He's the one who did all the stabbing. He's capable of some heinous shit.  How 'bout him down there?
I'm sure it don't.
My daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet.
The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
Absolutely. The map is very clear.
Let me take a look at that map.
Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
I'm serious, man. Don't mention it. Ever.
I know people.
Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
He said they keep it parked out behind the barn. Can't be that hard to fly a plane. Lots of people do it.
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys.
He's got my daddy's watch, Claude. I always knew whoever took that watch killed Winston Hancock. And that was you, Mr. Pike.
No, believe me, I'm gonna kill him!
That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
Don't call me soft, I hate it when you call me that.
They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey.
Damn, I shoulda let Spanky Johnson drown you in the river when I had the chance.
Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint.
New York. That's up north, ain't it? They'll find we do things different down here.
I heard some things so I went to see Spanky Johnson. He told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here. What happened to your face?
Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
I prefer bourbon.
Excuse me, sheriff. As we explained to your associate here, there's been a mistake. We didn't kill anybody. Now, as for the bootlegging, we happen to work for a very important man in New York.
Satchmo.
You should have come by last night, Radio. You woulda had yourself some fun.
Me? Willie Long.
I slipped in a couple of bottles of my latest batch. Help wash down all them pills they'll be giving you.
All I need is the front money and a truck. I could be back in two, three days tops if I had somebody to share the driving.
Alright, Ray, you've got a deal. Pick your man and get going.
I hear a train coming. Drink.
Is this a joke?
Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
You mother...
I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.
Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
You're already there...
It's freezing up here, Beefy.
Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
He's got 'til midnight tonight, Nicky.  You get your ass back up there. You save your father!
And I also happen to be a Jets fan.
Please, Nicky, get back up there.  Try to hurry.
What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
That's a pretty brassiere.
No.
Oh, would you grow up.
'Bout time...
The Dark Prince is here.
We know where to find Nicky.
Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
You smell like coconuts.
No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
You think I'm a tourist?
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
Wow. Maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles.
Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
No.
"Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head..."
That was Cassius!
I love you.
Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
No.
A black guy?
I've always wanted to kill someone. Can I do it?
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.
No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
Thanks.  I thought you'd be older. I expected a Red.
Your own work?
Not in my time...
Well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering.  You know, Logan -- you wonder a lot. Too much for a Sandman.
Of course not! I'm curious, not sick. 
Did you ever see anybody renew?
I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...
Where do you live, Mary?
Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
No.
How a Sandman lives.
Of course.
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
That's nice.
Uh-uh.
Muscle? I don't know that one.
I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.
Some kind of breeding pens... I suppose... They say people used to breed animals, fish, anything...  ...to eat, of course.
Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.
You know, Jessica.
You want there to be one... that doesn't...
Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
Yes...
I don't know.
What makes you think so?
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
Can you make it back?
This is our bedroom.
No, one of us is always here to let the maid in. Nobody else has a key.
Right... This just glided along.
Yeah.
Okay, then, I'll take you to dinner.
Sure.
Okay.
Are you positive he knows?
I'm not positive... but... he knows.
He works for Mr. Eddy.
What's he do?
In pornos?
No... A job... I didn't know what. He set up an appointment for me to see a man.
What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
You killed him.
You really don't remember the other night, do you?
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
The police called us.
Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.
The wife killer?
Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
Where is he now?
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
Yes, and we need to talk to him... if we can.  Mel, let's get Peter in here.
Who was the man?
Not even close.
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
No.
I'll get a manual.  and study it.
That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
What?
I don't know. Maybe a hotel.
Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
I'm sure you noticed that girl that was with me the other day... Good lookin' blonde? She stayed in the car?...
You know who it is.
Okay.
I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete.
No. No, I don't.
Great question!! In the east... the far east... when a person is sentenced to death... they're sent to a place where they can't escape... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head... it could be days... weeks... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced... This uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think? It's been a pleasure talking to you.
Sure.
Sorry... I...
I don't know.
What night?
Fossils.
A what?
Found in Asia!
You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
Why, of course. Yes.
Well, it looks to me as if we're traveling west.
I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
Do you think they're cannibals?
Mr. Conway, I don't like this place. I don't like it. It's too mysterious.
Yes.
You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
Well, there's nothing we can do until the morning.
Not for me, thanks. No, I'm too weary.
Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
Over by that hill.
Look, Bob!
Leaving?
When are you going to start?
We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.
Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?
They were.
Centuries.
Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?
Of course we have no money as you know it. We do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because, well, because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it.
I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
No thanks. Not tonight if you don't mind.
No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
Don't preach that cheap, second- hand stuff to me!  Go on, beat it. Beat it!
"Ungrateful fool . . . !"  Those were my very words to myself last night. "Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."
Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.
Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?
We have reason. It is the entire meaning and purpose of Shangri-La. It came to me in a vision, long, long, ago. I saw all the nations strengthening, not in wisdom, but in the vulgar passions and the will to destroy. I saw their machine power multiply until a single weaponed man might match a whole army. I foresaw a time when man, exulting in the technique of murder, would rage so hotly over the world that every book, every treasure, would be doomed to destruction. This vision was so vivid and so moving that I determined to gather together all the things of beauty and culture that I could and preserve them here against the doom toward which the world is rushing.  Look at the world today! Is there anything more pitiful?  What madness there is, what blindness, what unintelligent leadership! A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity crashing headlong against each other, propelled by an orgy of greed and brutality. The time must come, my friend, when this orgy will spend itself, when brutality and the lust for power must perish by its own sword. Against that time is why I avoided death and am here, and why you were brought here. For when that day comes, the world must begin to look for a new life. And it is our hope that they may find it here. For here we shall be with their books and their music and a way of life based on one simple rule: Be Kind.  When that day comes, it is our hope that the brotherly love of Shangri-La will spread throughout the world.  Yes, my son, when the strong have devoured each other, the Christian ethic may at last be fulfilled, and the meek shall inherit the earth.
Do you think this will come in my time?
Right, Bob.
Come on! Quick! This way.
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
George. George - do you mind? I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.
You can't leave, George.
So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
I don't need any proof.
Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.
Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
She came here in 1888!
I'm not wrong. She told me so. Besides, she wouldn't have to tell me. I'd know anyway.  I found out a lot of things last night.  I'm not ashamed of it either. It's probably one of the few decent things that's ever happened in this hellish place.
As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe.  Come now, child.
Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly—
I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner.  When he lands, we'll find out.
We'd be eternally grateful if you—
Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
Oh, you're going to make life very simple.
Why?
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
You'll wait till you rot!
Thank you.
Lose your name and identity, work endless hours an behalf people who don't know you exist, and abandon any hope that you might one day feel even the slightest bit sure of your place in the universe.
Your supervisors have no idea why you're here.
No-- it makes sense.  Cause I gotta tell ya, when I was in third grade they told me I was crazy cause I swore that our teacher was from, like, Venus or something.
Hang on. -- And this is the good part; when you're fully ordained, he'll come when you call him, too.  Dave.
Yes, air.  But I'm usually wrong. Sir.
Listen-- do me a favor-- don't mention the 140 thing--
Dee, you've been useful for 50 years.  We're clueless, you're tired. Why don't you go home and get some rest.
Home?  You gotta be kidding me.    Black?
Sir, you can't just--
We wear black.
Hey, I was workin' her.  I was workin' my thing.
I know, I know.  I read the manual. No attachments.  We work alone. Blah. blah.
The radio show?
That's the Loch Ness Monster.  And... Kay-- that's... 444-Eyes?
Well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they?
All of it?
I'd double it and add 20.
Kay!?
Kay.  Seriously.  What if he actually means what he says?
Man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all.
So... how did they get here?
What do we do?    Lean into it.
What the hell does that mean?
Well I'm going to give them something to be afraid of.
Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you.
I don't believe you, Mikey.  And you know why I don't believe you? Cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon.
I dunno. One?
Actually, yeah--
Did it leave?
Is it now?
Agatha...
What?
Do it.  Right here.  On the ground.
Wait.
You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
I am going back.  I see myself there.
Because I found out about her...
I know you're in a hurry, so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes.
The nano... what?
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
No... we have the two previsions from the twins right here, but...  ... I can't pull up any data from the female.  Probably just a glitch.
Lara --
If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
No?  How's an old man and a cop on the whiff ever going to stop them?
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
Everybody runs.
Red Ball -- double homicide: one male, one female.  Killer's male, white, 40's.
What?
I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
But you call this room the "temple".
Tell me how.
I'm your son.  I'm you.
Hold your breath, Dad...
Who made you do this?
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
Heal who?
You're talking about the precogs...
And how did Lamar become involved?
Not if I stay away from him.
Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.
We know why John was tagged.
Wait, just a second...
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
Yes.
Right here.
Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
Because he thinks he's innocent.
I don't know, why?
If you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?
How can you even tell?  You know how blind you are without your glasses.
I forgot my glasses.
Thanks.  You take anything in your coffee?
Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
Have you been there recently?
But John was with him at the pool?
What does he want with a precog?
What are you talking about?
Phone, room service, mini-bar. Any additional expense. If you need anything you can push the button marked 'Concierge', and they'll be able to help you.
Is it the good room?
Honestly, the suites are all about the same.
It's as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms.
Where's the place to go tonight?
Women?
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
No.
Will you paint the damn thing. Why do you gotta be such a baby.
Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.
Who's watching the baby?
Go.
Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin.
I want you to take her with you.
Look, man, I'm the bachelor, alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --
What's your record at?
Yeah.
It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing.
When's it going down?
He must have that shit troughed.
It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
Where's Ricky?
They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth.
Not driving Jess, you won't.
What?
You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.
So, that's it. I'm out?
Now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what I got to say?
Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me.
Not you. I want Ricky to answer.
I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.
You three are gonna meet him for dinner. Find out if and where. Now any of you motherfuckers got anything else to say?
Nah.
Traveling light. I like that.
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
Yeah.
Taken care of?
Excuse me, we need to make a call.
Ruiz isn't here.
We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to Max.
So, it was a draw.
I wouldn't keep bugging you, but you said he said he would have a job for us.
I thought you hate that club.
We don't need guns.
You wanna go right now?
I'll beat your ass --
I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
I like it.
See? Now everyone's got one on.  What do you got there?
She wants you to paint the ashtray.
What's the movie?
Great. On my fucking room.
Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
Oh really. Why's that?
Nothing else.
What the fuck do you...
You sold it? I thought they stole it.
Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.
I detected no vibe other than that Ruiz thinks you're a fucking idiot.
Back in.
She was jonesing for me.
Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up --
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
Eighty five.
What happened to the fifteen hundred?
Where do you get this shit?
Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy.  Whatever, I don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, I'm telling you one thing right now, I'm not gonna be late for the dance.
Fuck...
Yeah. Ricky Slade.
Ugh...
You strapped?
I don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard of the Westies?.
Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.
You want another drink?
You think it's funny, motherfucker?
The Soho Grand?
Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.
So, we're talking money laundering...
Who's up for a night on the town.
Red, and I ain't no punk.
Let 'em come. I'm ready.
Nnnnnnn!
I'm wearing, Archie.
Don't push it. You way ahead. You back on top. That boy loves you, man.
Man, get outa my face. I ain't nobody's punk.
Elijah who?
Elijah Muhammad can get you out of prison. Out of the prison of your mind. Maybe all you want is another fix. I thought you were smart.
I read. I study. Because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. Respect his body and his mind. Quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork.
Your mama had sense because the pig is a filthy beast: part rat, part cat, and the rest is dog.
What? Everybody knows God is White.
But everything the white man taught you, you learned. He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. And you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him. He told you black was a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary?
What the hell for, man?
Soiled with dirt, foul; sullen, hostile, forbidding -- as a black day. Foully or outrageously wicked, as black cruelty. Indicating disgrace, dishonor or culpability.
Where am I gonna start?
Who are you?
I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
I can't.
You want a new car? You want a new house? Is that it? It's the money, right?
All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister.
So it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat. The meat itself is foul.
Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
How do you like it?
Delicious.
Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.
I can handle it.
Yes. Did you eat?
You're with me even when you're away.
Because you're in trouble.
Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
That's enough, Brother Earl.
Let's cancel.
Just what are you saying?
You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?
Women are deceitful. They are untrustworthy flesh. I've seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by women.
No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
Yes, sir, I did.
Sure, man.
Are you Elijah's pimp?
Save it, baby. Save it for Mr. Right, 'cause your grandma's smarter than ya think.
Your control over your children, therefore --
Please make way, please --
What does Sidney say?
You're my father.
And don't come back.
C'mere.
I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna be Bogart sometimes.
Yeah.
What can you do?
You heard the Sergeant. Outside.
Yes sir.
This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.
Good grades. Fine athlete. President of his class.
Am I a suspect?
Sit, Creasy. Everything that happens from now on does so with my permission.  Really. You won't find a better carne asada in all of Mexico.
Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
So where do we begin?
He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
[Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]
[Who ordered it?]
[It's non-negotiable.]
[What do you mean?]
[And one of the founding members of La Hermanidad.]
[There was no ten million dollars.]
[That's what everybody keeps saying.]
Yes.
Show me, please.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
No, that was in Columbia.
Did you used to?
It's no wonder you're late. Why didn't she just come with you?
Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has a complete block about 'C' Minor. But remember, "Whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves." New Testament, Romans 13.
You'll be back in the water in twenty- four hours.
I'm fine.
Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.
[OK, repeat the drop instructions.]
And bankruptcy. Where will that put me in the social strata?
Our daughter.
I think it's fantastic.
You realize that you've brought a killer into the house.
Hmm?
That's ridiculous.
[That's good. Really good. He shot and killed two judicial cops and a kidnapper died in the attack. They're saying he's responsible.]
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
[He's the man, 'the Boss?' My guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots. We had to inject the whole Barrio. We bugged the house and stole the picture of him.]
He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him.
Two tourists who never went home.
Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better.
A man can be an artist in anything. Stone, paint, words. Food. Anything if his soul is true to it. Creasy's art is death. And he's about to paint his masterpiece.
You told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all.
All right, I'm having a fair time. It's just that I get one Saturday night off in three weeks, and I wanted to wind up with something tonight.
That big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend.
Yeah, sure.
There's a nice-looking little short one for you right now.
Where?
What for?
Brush her. Listen, you wanna come with me tonight, or you wanna go with this dog?
She wasn't so bad.
Catherine, you are a blanket of gloom. Wherever you are, the rain follows. Someday, you gonna smile, and we gonna declare a holiday.
Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.
No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home. Thank you very much anyway.
Well, at the time she told me this, she already had six. Every time I saw the woman, she was either...
I never thoughta that.
Don't worry about it.
You gonna die without a son.
Might as well siddown a minute, Clara.
She didn't look Italian to me.
I don't know! She don't look like Italian to me. Plenny a nice Italian girls around.
...and they sit down right next to me...
I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...
Hey, Louise, I want you to meet Marty Pilletti. Marty, that's Louise Kelly, inna back seat there.
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
I thought he was a big tall fat fellow. Didn't I meet him here one time? Big tall, fat fellow, he tried to sell me life insurance?
Well, there's the Stardust Ballroom. That's a kind of a big dance hall. Every Saturday night, it's just loaded with girls. It's a nice place to go. You pay seventy-seven cents. It used to be seventy-seven cents. It must be about a buck and half now. And you go in and you ask some girl to dance. That's how I met Virginia. Nice, respectable place to meet girls. You tell Marty, Aunt Theresa, you tell him, "Go to the Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes."
So she say, "You're spilling the milk." So she kept talking about these coupla drops of milk I spilled, so she got me so mad, so I said, "Mama, you wanna see me really spill some milk?" So I took the bottle, and I threw it against the door. I didn't throw it at her. That's just something she made up. She goes around telling everybody I threw the bottla milk at her. I didn't throw it anywheres near her. Well, I was sorry right away, you know, but she ran outta the house.
I think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling.
Lemme tell it, Tommy.
I'll see you at mass tomorrow. We'll sit down and we'll discuss the whole thing.
Virginia, I don't wanna hear no more about it!
...You hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time!
You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.
No.  Or why you should.
He said it for us all, Walt.
Where's he gonna use that kind of talk? 'The valley of the shadow of death.' Wait a minute, Ho-Jon...  I got something for you.
...No cases over the age of temptation but deliver us eight. from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, the power and...
Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
And it's the ninth inning.
Way we hear it, the Pride is supposed to have run up the highest lifetime batting average ever recorded in Wayne County.
Get out the scotch, Ho-Jon.  Don't mention the sex thing unless he brings it up.
Good thinking, Duke. How about it, Ho-Jon? Can you round up a few of the boys?
An application to Androscoggin College.
The nigra boy with the Philadelphia Eagles?
I worked with Spearchucker my first month over here, at the 72nd Evac in Taegu. Most of the colored guys know who he is but they're not talking because he asked them not to.
When?
Be right with you.
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
A football game?
Special Services in Tokyo are all for it. They say it's one of the main gimmicks we have to keep the American way of life going here in Asia.
At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
What?
I want to talk to you, Pierce.
Obviously you don't think so, and I don't know why.
So if it ain't staring us in the face, it's got to be retroperitoneal. And that, along with the look of the wounds, makes me figure he's got a hole in his sigmoid colon that we won't find unless we look for it.
C-A-M-E-M...?
If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
He's Trapper John! Only man in history who ever found fulfillment in the ladies' can of a Boston and Maine Railroad car! When the Conductor caught him in there with his Winter Carnival date, she screamed: 'He trapped me!' What have you been doing since those days, Trapper?
Part of him. Painless is the owner and operator of the Pride of Hamtrack. That's where he comes from... Hamtrack, Michigan.
The black capsule. Finest kind. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.
Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
How about squeezing him through into Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is catch lobsters, he can learn that here.
You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
What do we do?
And his track record, that don't count? Look, honey, when you watch the two shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss.
Okay, Major, honey.  I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. I'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine Regular Army clown. And that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine.  See you around the campus.
I think we could still have a chance.
Something else we have in common.
You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.
Precisely, Maria. Tonight you have the same privilege that comes on rare occasions to the chief executive of some state or nation... the privilege of restoring life, by one tender act of mercy, to a doomed fellow creature.
You think he won't.
I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.
At first is no doubt. But then I am seeing on his paper he work in American hospital. And I think there are so many drugs in such a places, he could take some by mistake.
Yeah!
Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
They missed the boat.
I'm too busy, actually. Not for the Army, of course, but where I live. Dr. Yamachi's New Era Pediatric Hospital and Whorehouse. I'm serious. The guy has this crude hospital for kids and a whorehouse on the side to finance it, all in the same building.
Well, one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eight-pound American-Japanese male.
Let's get his clothes off quick.
Poker sounds great. When do you play?
You noticed. I wasn't going to fool around over here. I've got these three girls I'm engaged to back home...
Don Juanism is just a cover... I've been reading up on it.  I'm a fake, I'm a fraud, I've been living a lie!
You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...
You guys got any black capsules?
Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.
That. It's out of the act.
Finest kind. Captain Forrests say you better haul ass home quick. We got new chest-cutter in our tent.
He's comin' this-a-way! The jaw- breaker!
Your tent?
Christ. All of a sudden it's West Point.
Yes, that's what I mean.
I did. First and only blow. So far.
I'm afraid so, Colonel.
Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
Yes, Colonel.
Good morning.
You got me.
Oh, yuh did, huh?
No.
Hello.
Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
Uh-huh . . .
You were? I thought you were chasing me?
I guess so. Then what happened?
Look, John—what we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek." It's just a—
Yeah, I've heard them a million times, too, but—there you are. Maybe they're like me. Just beginning to get an idea what those things mean.
Yes, sir.
No, no, no—that's your seat.
Well, don't say anything at all. Just sit down.
Huh? Oh, yes. Let's go.  Now, let's see. We want some action in these pictures.
Your purse. I need ten dollars.
The Websters.
You bet I will, Ma.
Oh, I can do that. I know this town inside out. Oh, give me a chance, please.
There is no letter. I made it up.
Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius— Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doe—and he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!
Sure!  When you get hold of a stunt that sells papers you don't drop it like a hot potato. Why, this is good for at least a couple of months. You know what I'd do? Between now and let's say, Christmas, when he's gonna jump, I'd run a daily yarn starting with his boyhood, his schooling, his first job!  A wide-eyed youngster facing a chaotic world. The problem of the average man, of all the John Does in the world.
John Doe.
Anybody! Er, er—Beany'll do!
Plus a bonus.
Yes.  What's he doing here?
Friend of his. They play duets together.
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
Where's Connell?
Go out and find her!
Take charge of him. Get him a suite at the Imperial and hire some bodyguards.
The heelots!
Yeh. Er, and my boss, Mr. Schwabacker made a job in his warehouse for old man Delaney—
Yeah?  Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
Shut up! If you weren't drunk I'd—
No, I didn't.
Well, the paper said there were some jobs around loose. Thought there might be one left over.
No you won't! You're through deciding anything!
No, she just left. I'm surprised you didn't run into her. She went over to Mr. Norton's house.
Oh!
Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get a—
Well, I was just thinking about this John Doe business. Why, as soon as it comes out it's all a fake, you'll be washed up in baseball, won't you?
Out the window! Something just flew by!
Not that we know of.
Dinner's on you.
"Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.
I'll take half of your action.
May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions.
This cousin of yours... What's his name?
Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
Fuck you! You know what he did to me?!...
Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail?
Huh?
Johnny who?
Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
Roper...
Yep.
SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
You're a real excitable sort, aren't you?
You caught me on an "up" day.  How about you? How did you end up in San Francisco?
Is there something wrong with that?
I don't really like to drink.
She grow up in Livingtston, too?
Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
We see each other every couple of months.
I need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so I can cut off his nuts.
I'm not good at lying.
Yes.
Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
He'll be running at the quarter pole.
How much you wanna bet?
And doing a very good job of it.
Pull up alongside.
Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
Let me show you something, Ray.
I ain't interested in your life story.
You worship yourself.
If you did, you never showed it.
No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
It's all over, babe, it's all over.
Scott...
The hell I am!
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
Who's running it!
Any verification on numbers.
What do you want?
Yes, I believe he has --
No, she said she had a son.  In a dream she once called life.
Of course they are.  Christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on.
What are you talking about?
But I don't know anything about programming.
Not you.  A copy.
Just like that --
Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
Resurrection.
Destination?
Access established.
What?!
Ah... sure.
Outside of his time warp he's aging at a vastly acellerated rate!
Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension.
... I just pray we're not too late.
TRICERATOPS!
Look closer.
Since Colosimo bit it, I gotta keep an eye out for his friends.
The commission don't decide how I spend my honeymoon.
Not another word.
That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
But from now on it's Lucky's spot.
Whatever you say, Boss.
Life knocked me back.
I guess I am. Just a little.
What do you mean?
Could we step outside?
We got our boys paintin' the house next door. Around the clock. We're gonna keep old man Profaci alive if it takes twenty coats.
That ain't what your mama said.
Sure, Frankie. Fuck me. Fuck Meyer. Fuck Arnold Rothstein who's made us all rich. All so you can be an fuckin' honorary Sicilian!
Ya never tell a guy about a broad.
As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war.
I'm gettin' married in six weeks. I'll already be in Atlantic City which is probably the best place to do it anyway.
It's not myself I'm worried about.
What's your problem?
Yeah. And no more Tommy Reina.
I know. When the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.
Calculated risks. But Boss, this one don't calculate.
He's trying to make it.
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
Joe Profaci. Carlo Gambino. Vinnie Mangano. Joe Bananas. They all gotta die.
Look at this boy. He hardly eats. Like that fella killed Caesar.
Not stupid. Fat.
Don, I'd be honored.
Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us.
And the Jews?
You're fuckin' crazy. You're all fuckin' crazy!
I turned him down flat.
Shuddup.
Spare us.
Best we got.
Guess so. Ya got a minute? I got somethin' for ya.
Most we've ever used is half a CC.
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
I'm sick of martinis. I'm sick of the waiting, and the carnival rides, and watching people's <u>nightmares</u>. And of course, I need not <u>add</u> -
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
I don't want to <u>stop</u> the nightmare, Hutch. I want to crank it up. I want to take it right off the charts. I want to <u>scare him awake</u>.
Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to -
Actually, Stu, Julie doesn't get to decide. That's why she was having the nightmare. <i></i> They're pulling the plug at nine AM.
It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
Well. As long as it's okay with Monkeybone -
Not me. Nope. You must've been dreaming.
That was <u>especially</u> Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be <u>us</u>. Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you.
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.
The ring...
Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense.
Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.
<i></i> I'm sorry, Kitty - what were you saying?
<u>What</u> union?
Mr. Hypnos - sir - I needed to talk to you -
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. ­- DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.
It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone?
You've been a hell of a figment, pal. I sure wish I could take you home with me.
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village.  I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night.
I don't want to talk about it.
You know, you never tell me anything.
That's not true.  Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York.
I'm sorry.
Mm hmm.
I'd love to.
Mm hmm.
Oh, it was such a big scandal.
... Manly?
Forty-five?  I thought it was only supposed to be thirty?
Thirty is base price.  Tolls, tax, tip ... it all adds up.
Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
I'm saying I didn't sign it!
I'll brain that guy! Well--call Paine-- call Saunders--
That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up.
Sure--sure. He must have a compass with him.
Huh?
Wait--wait. Let's see--watchdog McGann-- he's bound to move right in--get him out of the way first--  Pardon me, friend--I've got some telephoning to do--! 
Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
I don't mind *who* gets licked in a *fair* fight, Diz. It's these clouts below the belt I can't take. Sicking that horrible dame on him--when he's goofy about her--
--followin' Miss Susan Fass-Pass around--his little heart poundin' away--the sound of angels' wings in his ears.
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
Like a mother sending her kid off to school for the first time--watchin' the little fella toddling off--in his best bib and tucker--and you sink in the middle--hoping he can stand up to the other kids--won't get his feeling hurt--and--if you could only spare him the knocks he's gotta take--  Say--who started this?
Yeah.
Tunnel?
Is the wind tired out there?
Yeah--that's right. Diz--
What?
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
Right now--everything I own--!
Take me home, Diz.
No, no--believe me, pet--this is *most* urgent--  Hello, hello. Is Taylor there?-- Governor Hopper. Quickly, please--
Not at all. I've come to pay you a personal and official--and I might say--a *tardy* tribute, Mr. Smith, for your recent heroic conduct.
The--head?
Peter, I'm in no mood to hear childish prattle!
Emma! Will you *please*--?
Well, that ends that crisis. This way, Senator.
What makes you think he's got *anything* to do with it?
Has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--?
You don't have to tell me Jeff. We were a team, the two of us, a struggling editor and a struggling lawyer. The twin champions of lost causes, they used to call us.
No.
That's all right, my boy--don't bother--
The gentleman has said repeatedly that he is speaking to the people of his State. He has been waiting, as he so fancifully puts it, for them to come marching here in droves. Would the gentleman be interested in knowing what those people have to say?
We'd better see.
Office of--Senator Smith?
*No*!
I mean--gosh--I wouldn't be comfortable in a--I--I haven't got clothes and things like that--and--I couldn't keep pigeons *there*--No--I-- I just--just wouldn't be--
If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
A *day*!
Committee.
Why?
Good. Where are we?
That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be--
I said--shall we get started *now* or--
He did?
Well, if it's all the same to you--
Hurray!
A camp! Well!
Wonderful!
How are the pigeons?
And how's your bill, Senator?
Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week.
Senator, you can talk all you want to, now.
Yes, *sir*.  Let's *go* Henry.
Well--I can *manage*--
What! Who?
My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.
Tomorrow! Joe--he'll hear the section on Willet Dam. He can't be there!
No?
Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
Oh, now--that won't do--
Nice *compliment*!
What are you driving at? You want *me* to get him to sign that?
He's lost complete faith in me--
All right--*yes*! And what does that make me to him? *Nothing*! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!
Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
Well, what do you want me to do? Stand around like you chump and let that drooling infant wrap that Willet Creek Dam appropriation around my neck. Either he falls in line with us and behaves himself or I'll break him so wide open they'll never be able to find the pieces.
Oh, it's all right--it's all right. It seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years, especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe, I've put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends, but I guess we'll survive. We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense, that's all. In the meantime, you explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam. It's your bill-- it's your reputation, and if he can't find enough facts to break you with, you just send him to me and I'll give him a couple of good ones. I'm taking the next plane home.
Jim, it's just that I like the kid-- I don't want to see you get too rough on him.
*I* know what I'm doing! I'll say what I *want*!
Anything *better* to offer?
Keep doing it! This is the whole works, Joe--we're out of business of bigger than we then we ever were. We can't miss a trick--we can't stop at *anything*--till this yokel's smashed up and buried so deep he'll never--!
All right, we'll take Jeff with us--
Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"!
Senator Paine.
Uh-huh.
He sure is pixilated.
Yes, you own it.
Next, please.
Yes.
Yes!
You are , aren't you?
Tell me more about yourself.
Huh?
I'm not worrying any more. I suppose they'll go on writing them till they get tired. You don't believe all that stuff, do you?
What did you mean by that?
Yeah, then what?
Running away is no solution.
We're not going out tonight.
Is he really that big a sap?
Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?
You're crazy! You can't do that!
Just one little drink - and then we're ready to shoot.
Yes, sir.
Is that the best you've got?
Oh, yes sir.
Yes! Yes! Let's get on with it.
Hang up.
Okay, then. Go to it.  And, Charlie—
Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
How do you do.
Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates.
Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
Only common sense.
Arthur wants to quit!
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to—
Yes, I guess I'll have to.
Not hungry. I want to get through this work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on those trucks?
Come on, come on. What are you trying to do, kid? Keel over? You haven't been out of this house in two weeks.
That's what I thought. If you don't mind, I'm rather interested in the Treasurer's report. I'd like to hear it.
Well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.
Me?!
Uh-huh.
A farmer, eh! You're a moocher, that's what you are! I wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! You're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!
Yes. Your uncle's common-law wife. She has a legal claim on the estate.
A child? My uncle's?
If she was his wife, she should have all the money. That's only fair. I don't want a penny of it.
You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
Oh. That.
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
Proceed.
Don't pay any attention to her.
Now you keep out of this!
Where is your farm?
It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
What two policemen?
Yes, sir.
I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written."
What happened?
It's happened before.  I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. I can't understand it.  I'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't I?
What's that?
That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
I'm fine.
What kind of doubts?
Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.
Not for this. Not me, you're not.
What exactly is it supposed to do?
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
Yes.
What?
It was Henry Follett.
You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
Not sure. Let me think about it.
Why do you watch?
Okay.
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love.
You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
That would explain it.
Did you straighten her out?
What kind of doctor are you?
That's right, the fake kind.
Just who is here, can you tell me?
I'd better not, I'll fall right to sleep. I think it's too soon for me to be sleeping with you.
I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
Is she against you getting help?
You've got a funny idea of funny.
Be specific.
Uh-huh.
It doesn't matter. Go on.
It's pretty obvious to a trained professional.
Is something wrong, Sofie?
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
You're upset.
First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you.
I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well.
What was that?
I think you can understand why I have some serious questions about your methods. I mean, obviously it becomes much more likely that I'm going to have confusion about this when your idea of treatment is to go walking in the woods and up to make- outs-ville and do all these highly romantic activities --
You probably got the idea.
I know it! Please believe me, I know that...
In maybe three or four issues.
It's called pro bono.
It's my bit for the community.
What happened today?
True. Should we stop them?
Uh-huh.
He said -- "Which we already knew!"
He agreed?
Nah... scotch.
No, no... I have three billion dollars.
You'd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. They're busy. It's not as easy as you think.
Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily, runs the coffee shop?
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
Well, there's Lily.
It's just a thought.
Definitely.
It's time you did some talkin', Dr. Mum -- Wait a minute. That is your name, isn't it?
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
No... no training.
Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.
And then killing your sister.
I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
Why do you like to fight so much?
Immune from what?
Who needs smart women? I put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons, Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this mess!
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold!
And what did he say?
Broad?!
Who was talking about what?
You don't believe in curses, huh?
No. I believe if I can see it and I can touch it, then it's real. That's what I believe.
Something like that.
Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself
Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
The creature!? Are you sure!?
Oh no, not another worthless trinket, Jonathan, if I bring one more piece of junk to the Curator to try and sell for you.
Picked his pocket, actually.
Shut-up and get me off of here!
We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister.
We'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them.
What are you going to do? Shoot him?
I know that you're recruiting your old henchmen...
One last tweak.
Really?
I'm the Bowler.
But they all had one thing we haven't got.
The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.
I dunno.
Get on to yourself!
Ummm.
Have you considered my offer?
Should I kill them?
You're nuts.
They always call the great ones nuts.
Too bad. PLUG HIM!
What?
I saw him walk you home.
Date?
I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home?
Have you always lived here?
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
Monica, where are you?
And what if you get killed?
The wise snake coils before he strikes.
It is not dead. It is hiding.
Blow it out your bean hole, Pancho!... And to hell with the rest of you!... Look at you. Bunch of rejects. I didn't need you before -- and I don't need you now!  The great ones RIDE ALONE!  Adios, muchachos! 
How could I see him if he's invisible?
Because that's what it is.
A vague similarity? IT'S THE SAME GUY!
Who's chicken? 
Shhh.
Archenemies! Casanova isn't just a criminal -- he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our ticket to fame, fortune -- and babes!
Oh shut up.
Normal. What's normal? Does normal exist? And if it did, how would we know it?
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
Wow.
Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw.
You did?
Sorry.
Very well, General, what is it you wish to say?
Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?
I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
Proceed.
Where are they?
Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
I don't know, sire.
What cowardice!  What treason! Joseph has ruined everything.  How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come, come, turn your troops around, General Belliard.
Oh, shit, that's not right.
Come in.
Bastia -- and you?
I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
I see...
Why are you carrying the dog?
When you eat him, may I have some?
Four o'clock.
It is the work of incendiaries.
But to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible? It would take a carefully organized plan, tons of combustibles and hundreds of people.
No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again.
I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.
Then what brings you out on such a night?
Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.
Is it a nice warm room, sir?
Oh, yes... of course.
No -- Captain Charles commanded the cavalry escort, and rode outside the carriage.  In the evenings, he always ate at another table.  They hardly ever spoke to each other.
I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child.
Yes, of course.  Hortense, darling, will you tell Louise to bring some sherry?
Oh, you must forgive me, General Bonaparte, I'm afraid you will think me incredibly stupid but I know absolutely nothing about this. Eugene is so independent -- he hardly tells me anything any more, and he has so many things in his room, I must confess I wasn't even aware that he had this sword -- you know how boys can be!
Of course.
Go away -- I'm busy.
Where is Madame Trillaud?
How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.
I will be there in five minutes.  Go back to your guests.
Yes.
Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.
I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.
Why not?
Yes.
You wrote it.
My God, what do you think?
I believe so.  I believe Madame Bonaparte was not discreet, in Paris.
Of course, my dear.
Does she deserve anything better?
Very well, Citizen Lieutenant.  You have come to the right place, for I am Citizen Varlac.
Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone.
My mother has always loved me.  She would do anything for me.
Life is a burden for me.  Nothing gives me any pleasure; I find only sadness in everything around me.  It is very difficult because the ways of those with whom I live, and probably always shall live, are as different from mine as moonlight is from sunlight.
Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs.  The amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much.
Anything you need.
Don't move me.
That's cron-don, sir.  My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite?
Shut up!  Fo' I pump this Glock in yo' ass!  What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach?
This my baby.  I feel like a new nigga in this car.  I get mo' phone numbers rollin' this, than I ever did on the bus.
Thanks, I just wish my mother had a chance to see it.
Yeah, I'm alright.  Is my face still orange to you?
What's the matter with your girlfriend?
That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too.
Yeah, that's why I walked down here.
Damn...how much money ya'll got left from the lottery?
I know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters.
Ain't no windows in here.
Sorry about today, man.
How you know?  It could be anything.
No.
Me too.
That pump was full of money.  I saw where they put it.  Stay right here, I'mma climb in and go get it.
No, man, just wait.
Make sure.
Hold on.
I said hold on!
Could you hurry up, please... it's kinda hot out here.
I don't play for no team.
I feel you.  I've just been practicing that one move all week.  I thought that was it.
R-U-S-H Intensely.
This is a knock.
He's a boy, dude.
Thanks for the help.
Joker, a man like yourself can do a lot for this community.  By letting us go, you can improve black and brown relations.
Huh?
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
I don't know.  Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them.
What's the matter?
Well, Craig, you're welcome anytime.
Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
What you doing to my nephew?
Craig, you ain't the only lightweight around here.
Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
For what?  We ain't gonna have no house after the auction tomorrow!
What happened here?
What?
Huh?
I...
I love it when pistolero's talk of trust.
Don't worry. She's good with kids.
Good.
Yes, I'm listening.
The gun...
Me?
Keep your voice down.
I want'to talk to her.
No, that's,..that's fine
No! You can't! They're in on it.
Yeah, all right, listen...
Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.
Thank you.
No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
I don't think so.
Why?
Just put her on.
What do you figure he done with it?
Would you have free candy for the kids, Preacher?
What religion do you profess, Preacher?
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
No.
Yes! Yes!
Throw that money in the River! In THE RIVER!
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
Don't need no soap. I'm boilin' down the fat from my hog.
You don't hardly get settled till you're frettin' to git home again.
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
Mother, I only --
Sshhh! He's in there.
I would love to be satisfied Harry Powell don't think I've got that money somewhere.
It's for the pick-nick. And you won't get a smidgen of my fudge unless you stay for the pick-nick!
She tarried around the kitchen after I'd gone up, and when I went downstairs to see what was wrong...
You better not sing that song.
Hm?
Pearl! Oh, Pearl!
I didn't figger ye rowed that skiff from Parkersburg!
Nothin'!
No. No.
What?
Don't you believe me?
I knowed your Daddy.  And do you know what your Daddy said to me? He said, "Tell my little girl Pearl there's to be no secrets between her and you."
Tst-tst! Then I reckon I'll have to try again! Where's the money hid?
Can I have milk too?
Pearl and John.
Yes; from the first night.
She turned me out of the bed.
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the bureau.
Harry, what --
Right funny, hain't it, how they rowed all the way up river in a ten- foot john-boat!
You'll whip me!
The Drugstore?
He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
Since the murder. She was fine before that.
Thank God.
She's entering deep sleep now. Heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed. All normal. She could dream at any time now.  Right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet. Waiting to see what shows up.
You believe in the Boogey Man?
One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.
I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway.
What!?
And you'll be here to catch him, right?
'Anything funny' like what?
Get into bed.
He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
Really. Turn 'er up a little.
That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
I have nothing to hide.
I see.
You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia!
That's another thing... it's spring.
If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason.
Imagine, we don't have to whisper any longer.
Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?
May I ask how much your rooms are?
Which part of the room is mine?
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
We have opened a restaurant...
Well, if your mother turns against you, you have to look for someone to adopt you.
That's all right.
Shall I draw your bath, sir?
Good evening, Monsieur.
I don't feel like any breakfast.
Eight forty-two, sir.
I guess it is eight forty-two.
And Gaston, I was happier all day long. I felt I'd contributed something.
No, sir.
Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case.
...the Russia of piroshki... people will eat and love it.
But you can't...
Get out of here!
I think she covered you with the parasites.
Two thousand francs.
A week?
Just three people in a room this size? Whew!
But, gentlemen, I am afraid...
All right -- go ahead... you talk to the lawyer and I'll talk to the judge!
She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!
All right, then make an appointment with her so I can see her!
I will not repeat your mistake. I will have no dealings with the Grand Duchess nor her representative.
No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?
What can I do about it?
Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately.
Don't hold that against me... please!
Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
Confess what?
Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
How long do we have to wait here?
Suppress it.
And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
Do not misunderstand me. I do not hold your frivolity against you.  As basic material you might not be bad, but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. I feel sorry for you.
I will start with you.
Your general appearance is not distasteful.
The telephone is ringing.
Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
Probably not.
I have never heard one.
Foolish? If this dress were to walk down the boulevard all by itself I would follow it from one end of Paris to the other, and when I caught up with it I would say, "Just a moment, you charming little dress, I want you to meet Ninotchka... you two were meant for each other." Ninotchka feels more comfortable.
That's when one half of Paris says to the other half, "What are your plans for this evening, madame?"
No... go on.
Now, Ninotchka... please!
...and we won't clench our fist...
But I can throw it out of the window.
Yes, sweetheart. 
The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
Good morning, Swana.
Oh, Leon, you are so good to me. 
Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
Tell him I won't be able to see him for a half an hour.
Darling, calm down. Why do you need a lawyer? Haven't you your little Volga boatman?
Oh, please, Swana! I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels. Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her.
Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.
I'm going, Leon...  but before I leave I must compliment you on your gown, Madame Yakushova. Is that what they're wearing in Moscow this year?
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
Hello.
Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little château in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...
I must ask you to leave.
Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...
I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
That depends on the tip.
Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
Please... sit down.
Thank you.
No.
I haven't either, but I've heard about them. You must realize it was only on the strength of your Paris report that I sent them to Constantinople; without that I never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal.
I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be?
Raw carrots and beets.
It's just a place for workmen.
Where is it?
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
I mean, who the hell cares about this penny-ante shit.  Goldwater put it right.  He said: "Well for Christ's sake, everybody bugs everybody else; we know that." ... It's the cover-up, not the deed that's really bad here.  If only Mitchell could step up and take the brunt of it; give them the hors d'oeuvre and maybe they won't come back for the main course.  That's the tragedy of all this.  Mitchell's going to get it in the neck anyway. It's time he assumed some responsibility.
We have nothing to hide.  But the only flaw in the plan is that they're not going to believe the truth.  That is the incredible thing!
John, you don't want to start down that road.  I remember what Whittaker Chambers told me back in '48 -- and he was a man who suffered greatly -- he said, "On the road of the informer, it's always night."  This is beyond you or even me.  It's the country, John.  It's the presidency.
Yes ... I got the money.
Is it?
I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.
Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you.
I figured that out.
Yeah?
Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"? That'll be the day.  The whole suit of armor'd fall off.
Mitchell?
No!  Magruder!  That sonofabitch tests my Quaker patience to the breaking point.
He left his White House phone number in his hotel room.
Uh, we've never done this before, sir ... How do we pay?  In ... hundreds?  Do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills?
We should set up a Cuban defense fund on this; take care of all of them.
Looks like he talked to Joe Kraft ... and to the Times.  Told them he was dead set against the bombing, that you were ... "unstable."  Claims he has to handle you "with kid gloves" ...
He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
That's what they're doing.
This could trigger the impeachment. They'll go to the Supreme Court next.
Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
It came over from Vietnam, you know.
We were working on China.
"Security" is not strong enough.
That's right, and it's more a problem for Ehrlichman.  He fixed Hunt up with the phony CIA ID's, but ... what else does Hunt have on us?
He'll need a pretext.  He'll never figure one out for himself.
The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice.
He didn't veto it.  I ran the White House side.  The mob contact was Johnny Roselli.  One of the CIA guys was that jackass, Howard Hunt.
And not just Hunt.  Frank Sturgis, all those Cubans.  All of them in the Watergate.  They were involved in Track 2 in Cuba.  Hunt reported to my military aide. But I met with him several times as Vice President.  That's what worries the shit out of me.  I don't know how much Hunt knows.  Or the Cubans.
Because ... because Dick Helms knows too much ... If anyone in this country knows more than I do, it's Hoover and Helms!  You don't fuck with Dick Helms!  Period.
Because he didn't even know about it. The CIA never told him, they just kept it going.  It was like ... it had a life of its own.  Like ... a kind of "beast" that doesn't even know it exists.  It just eats people when it doesn't need 'em anymore.  Two days after the Bay of Pigs, Kennedy called me in.  He reamed my ass ...
No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
Don't forget, the most important thing in your life is your relationship with your Maker ...  Don't forget to be on God's side.
My God, my God!  He talked to the New York Times?
Why would they?!  Who the hell's Sulzberger anyway?  Their parents are gold traders from Eastern Europe. They buy things.  They come to Jew York City and they buy up things.  One of the things they buy is the New York Times.  And you know what?  Be proud because they'll never trust you, sir, because we speak for the average American.
... worrying whether someone said something "nice" about them.  All short-term, frivolous bullshit; Ben Bradlee worrying about Teddy Kennedy liking him ...
Then this shall be our little secret.  Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees.  Thou may fool the world. Even thy father.  But not me, Richard. Never me.
Did he have to die for me to get it?!
What ... ?
You're not gonna quit on me, are you, Harold?
Firing you, Mr. Helms, wouldn't do any good.  Of course you'll continue as DCI.  You're doing a magnificent job.
And of course I accept.  I'm flattered.  And I want you to know, I work for only one president at a time.
We have recent intelligence that a Soviet nuclear submarine has docked at Cienfuegos.
It is not my practice to spy on the president.  Doctor Kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own.
Turn this crap off, Clyde.  It's giving me a headache ... You may go, Joaquin.
You should ask Bobby.
I know ...
You asked if you could count on my support ... As long as I can count on yours.
Who do you think is behind it?
Well, you have CIA people all over the place.  Helms has seen to that.  Then there's Kissinger's staff. Kissinger himself, I believe, maybe the leaker.
I always get my man.
Yeah, you do.  I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes?
A guy named Gordon Liddy.  Thinks he's Martin Borman.  You wanna meet him?
So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
Dogs ... Season starts tomorrow.  It keeps me calm.  I don't like going back into the same building four times.
Anything goes wrong, head for your homes, just sit tight -- you'll hear from me or Howard.
She's quite pretty.
Churchill, DeGaulle, Disraeli.  They all went through the pain of losing power.
What I think is ... they're cowards. Their opposition represents the cowardice of the Eastern Establishment.  They don't realize as you do, Mr. President, that the Communists only respect strength, and they will only negotiate in good faith if they fear the "madman," Richard Nixon.
Oh God, I'm going to throw up.
You know, this kinda thing, you gotta be brutal.  A leak happens, the whole damn place should be fired.  Really. You do it like the Germans in World War II.  If they went through these towns and a sniper hit one of them, they'd line the whole goddamned town up and say: "Until you talk you're all getting shot."  I really think that's what has to be done.  I don't think you can be Mr. Nice-guy anymore ...
But I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied about knowing Chambers.  The documents were old and out of date, like these Pentagon Papers.  The key thing we proved was that Hiss was a liar.  Then people bought it that he was a spy.  It's the lie that gets you.
Four.  Two boys.  Two girls.  And eight wounded.
You're doing the right thing, Dick ... don't let 'em shake you.
That was a long time ago.
... Use his women.
... Any information you have, Edgar. The sonofabitch is not gonna steal from me again!  Can you back me up on this?  Can I count on your support?
She must be very attractive.  Would she like an autograph?  She might remember me ... Where's Trini?
I know.  I know.  I've seen a lot of kids die, too, in World War II.
It sounds like you're talking about a wild animal.
That's right.
It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
You're not a failure, Dick.
No.  I'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again.
The girls will grow up.  They only know you from television anyway.
Is that the truth?
Are you okay?
Because ... I have to relax.
You personally?
Tomorrow.
Brezhnev's coming in three days.  I don't want to deal with them.  And him.  And you.
You can't expect me to explain that to you.
Repartee, Dick -- very good.  Hey, I feel ten years younger!  It makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life?
Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it.  I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court.
You know: how the voters are gonna play your divorce.
Not hardly nothin' in her room. And that establishment was no stickler on registration. Well...
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
I suppose. Though they was leavin' in a hurry.
Yes.
Try "old" on for size.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
That don't hardly say it. He shoots the desk clerk one day, and walks right back in the next and shoots a retired army colonel.
No I ain't.
Not word one.
He won't neither. He never has.
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
Yessir. We should a brought wieners.
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
You figure him for a dope runner?
But you don't believe it.
It's a mess, ain't it Sheriff?
Believe you're right.
No sir.
Yessir.
You gonna drive out there?
Yessir.
I think I'm goin' to commence dedicatin' myself twice daily. It may come to three times before it's over...
When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.
What do you think.
I mean, would you care to join me.
Okay. Two of 'em. Both had my father. It's peculiar. I'm older now'n he ever was by twenty years. So in a sense he's the younger man. Anyway, first one I don't remember so well but it was about meetin' him in town somewheres and he give me some money and I think I lost it. The second one, it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night.
Things happened. I can't take 'em back.
I don't know, I had the sheriff here from Terrell County --
What's that.
You go to hell.
You know she won't be there.
No. Do you?
That's foolish. You pick the one right tool.
With what?
Why would you be comin' back? We'll be closed.
You live in that house behind the store?
Just call it.
Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin?
All right. Heads then.
They'll give you a wallop.
That's twenty-six dollars.
There's somebody lookin' for me. Not police. Just call me if anyone else checks in tonight.
Okay.
Why don't I set you down here and we won't argue about it.
I want you to take me to another motel.
How well do you know Chigurh.
Yes?
I know, I've seen him. Sort of.
Not that way.
What did you do?
He isn't. You're not cut out for this. You're just a guy that happened to find those vehicles.
That is correct. And how do I decide?
Are you in the service?
Nam?
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
You know, Elden, some people actually read more than just the Classifieds...
Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
Did you send anyone out there?
You better handle what's in this garbage can first.
Junior year!
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
Any idea where it is?
Little place called "Williams," why?
I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night.  Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
No, I was just... How you doing?
They're fine... you miss it?
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
Well, I certainly would have heard about that.
Alright. Oh, and one more thing about what you did yesterday... Well done.
Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
I know that. I can't tell you how many times I've said that to myself in those exact words.
You're late, Eric.
Yes, she is.
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
Stop calling me David. We're on set, for Christ's sake, you don't have to call me David here.
Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
They're new to us...
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
Make sure it's elevated...
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
Roy! What are you doing here?
He's a prick. Merle?... You're a prick.
I'd slap his face.
Sure I loved it! It was great.
Worse.
Yeah, but at least I knew Rome was gonna be there when I arrived...
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
I married a car salesman.
'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
No, this one was worse... I had to have the place sprayed when he left. Twice... He was two guys before the last one -- not counting a little office thing in there, which I'm trusting you with, 'cause if it gets out, I'm on the street...
Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?
He has a wife?!
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
You said in L.A., anything goes.
What? Where was he?!
Shhh! I heard you the first time.
IT'S NOT ABOUT GAS MONEY!!  You have a thing for an actor on a stupid white soap opera, and we searched all over town for his character! Not the actor -- whose name is George, by the way. His character!
Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
You never know who you'll see.
You still in love?
To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
Rosa...
Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
Really. And where was that, old man?
Andersonville.  They did horrible things to men there...
Ahh... my wife's.
No...
...and put them in your mouth.
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
You told me how to do it!
Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry...  ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. She's an amateur, just like Del was.
Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
Well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband?
What?
It's a very moving experience, trust me.
One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.
'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...
I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
I said 'got it?'
No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
No... before that.
David Ravell.
Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges...
You can't do this - we just been pardoned!  By the Governer himself!
Good Lord, what do we do?
And no transmission belt for two weeks neither.
You should a joined us, Everett. It couldn't a hurt none.
Pull over, Everett - let's give that colored boy a lift.
I left my pomade in that car! Maybe I can creep up!
Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R- U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!
We're adventurers, sir, currently pursuin' a certain opportunity but open to others as well.
Not that I'm aware.
Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.
Oh Lord yes, any parish'r precinct; I was makin' the larger point.
Devil his due.
Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.
Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.
No - you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you?
No weddin'.
Not your...
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
Well now honey, that ring is at the bottom of a pretty durned big lake.
Yes, but honey -
Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!
The hell you say! Wash is kin!
It was in his bureau.
That don't make no sense!
Pete, the personal rancor reflected in that remark I don't intend to dignify with comment, but I would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism. Consider the lilies a the goddamn field, or-hell!- take a look at Delmar here as your paradigm a hope.
Damnit, I just hadda bust out! My wife wrote me she was gettin' married! I gotta stop it!
Sir, the Soggy Bottom Boys been steeped in ol'-timey material. Heck, you're silly with it, aintcha boys?
Oh I remember 'em, colored fellas I believe, swell bunch a boys, sung into yon can and skedaddled.
Well I guess folks don't mind they's integrated.
Blooey!
Who gave you this idea?
Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk --
The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
A long time ago.
No you're not. You're failing the big one, baby, and I don't just mean in here. I mean in life. I've watched you, Mayo, and you don't mesh. You grab-ass and joke around but you don't make friends, not the way the others do.
I don't want to do something anybody can do.
Maybe there's hope for you yet.
Mayo, you didn't hear me -- I said I I'm busy! And so are you! Go get cleaned up!
I know.
No, sir.
Yes, sir!
Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
Is your brother a flyer?
Vietnam?
Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.
See you in a month when you get liberty!
But in what ways?
He'll show. I'd bet my paycheck on it.
No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same!
Of course there was a baby. I'd never lie about something like that. Would I, Paula?
He didn't give you much choice.
You got no manners and you never tell the truth! You're nothin' special. And if you ask me, you got no chance at all of being an officer!
What's stopping you?
Who says I'm not going after what I want? My mother's thirty-nine years old and she still works in that factory. Every time I see her, I know exactly what I don't want.
I've seen all that a hundred times.
I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises.  Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
Why?
I can't risk it.
I hate to tell you guys, but only two out of every class make it into jets. Which one of you is going with me?
My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died.  I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette.
Jesus Christ, Sid! Is everything your responsibility?
What do you think?  Get us into that room.
Are you gonna open the safe?
Not that one.
I know.
They're not supposed to be here!
So we keep an eye on her.  Raoul can totally administrate that part.
When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
Okay, fuckball, you think.  What are we gonna do?
Adios.
Everything okay?
I don't get it.
Huh?
Master closet.
It's just the woman and the kid?
No, you will not, because without Burnham there's no way in hell we're gonna get into that safe, so as far as I'm concerned he can paint your ass blue and run it up a flagpole and you won't lay a finger on him, you understand me?
What?
And with kids like he's got, no wonder he wanted a place to hide.
Got us in here, didn't I?
Feel okay?
Nope.
Chills?
They're coming in here, aren't they?
Say fuck.
Get the fuck out of my house!
I don't know, why?
On the floor!  Get on the floor!
Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
Shhh...
Not in the bedroom.  Do it!
Uh uh.
Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?
And they sure ain't from the neighborhood. Figure Sabu's in there?
You gotta. You gotta stay alive. You know what they were trying to do here. You got the pigs dead to rights. It's like Huey said, you're more important than any of us.
I have confirmed to you my address, that's all I'm required to by law to do. We have broken no law.
I hear you. Alright. I'll go, you stay.
Just hold on a god damn minute. I...
Yeah, it's me.
Shut up. Just shut the fuck up.
You know that's bullshit.
Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
Look this is bull...
Party needs the bread.  Be hip to the struggle, only a dollar!!!
Hmmm. As you know the Bureau -- and Mr. Hoover -- is particularly "sensitive" to anything that might agitate or solidify the coloreds on the left.
From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
We're working on that...
So talk...
Look... can we deal with this tomorrow... I'm tired...
Tell that to the pigs. Better yet tell that to Malcolm.
Right on Brother Judge...
You fit the profile, Brother. You look exactly like the kind of nigger they think they can trust...
Well, act like it. Come on.
Yeah, well, cops kick the shit out of kids too.
Anything happens to Huey it ain't gonna be a finger. I'll...
S'alright. I'm sorry too. Shit, I gotta take a leak... Pull over at that gas station.
What are you saying?
You don't look alright.
I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
Uh... uh... I...
You call that a compliment?
It worked.  How many men can you raise?
I've done nothing and for that I am ashamed.
Of course, I do.
Goodbye.
Lovely.
First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
My pleasure, sir.
I will do so as soon as possible.
Apology accepted.  Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable.
Sir?
Are you going to meet with him?
Probably.
Rioting both sides of the bay, in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent.  He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats.
Yes.
I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
Is that so?
How old are you?
She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan.
I don't believe it... and I wasn't there for it...
She said that?  Oh, my Lord, she said that?
Yes.
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
Who's in command?
What are my orders?
Not held, just slowed down.
Four thousand infantry and around six hundred cavalry...  ... including the Green Dragoons under Tarleton.
How many men have we seen die?
Thank you.  Maybe all of this will buy him some peace.
About a hundred and twenty.  Less than a third.
Yes, he does.
Remember Braddock?
That bad?
Six-pounders.  Lots of them.
Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
Ellie...Ellie...what...
Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee.
Well, I thought it was safe--
Well, it's always better to take precautions--but I'm sure Church will be all right, honey...
I know.
I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?
I'm sure you're not.
What were you listening to?
I like rock and roll. No...I guess that's too mild. I love it. Since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music I can really hear. And since my wife died...I dunno, some- times a little rock and roll fills up night. Not always, but sometimes.  One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope your time here will be a happy one.
Sure.
Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
Then come on.
Wouldn't wash?
Why, then, things should be fine.
What?
And because the dead walked.
You don't understand--
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
Do you think I didn't hear her tonight, crying as if her heart would break? Here she is thinking Church is going to die.
And Church will be fine.
Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise.
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
And Jack.  And the crew.  Free and unharmed.  If you agree ... then ... I will remain with you.
Quite, boy, or you'll lose your tongue.  Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship.  I agreed to set them free.  I didn't when ... nor where.
No you won't.
The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?
Track you down and --
See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.
You're playing this as close to the edge as any man, I'll give you that.  We might just have to sign articles, you and I.  Jack, you're a pirate at heart, that's certain.
Bosun!  Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters, nice and fine ... in the brig.  Meaning no disrespect, of course.
Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
Fetch a hook -- haul him out of there!
You're speaking up for him again?
He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.
Well, I am not going to stay hidden in some cabin, or I suppose it's going to be heaving bosoms and bare for the remainder of the voyage!
Women in London must have learned to not breathe.
I know the code.
Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
At least once more, Miss Swann. As always.
Truthfully -- you were a bit late.
-- then we never would have met.
No.  This won't work.  I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on.
I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child.  Let's hear it.
Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.
I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.
Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold.
I know.  That was for the smell.
That we are.
Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
That so?  I've heard of one, supposed to be fast, neigh uncatchable ... the Black Pearl?
You would do that?
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
Only a little.
Move!
Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
Is that so?
I swear, you look just like him.
My name is Will Turner, the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner.  His blood runs in my veins.  You need my blood.  And on my word I will pull this trigger, and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!
Jack!
The worst.  On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and who knows how to get what he wants.  Now that's a great pirate.
Yes.
No.
He may be.
Mentioned it, is more what he did.
An explosion in the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed.
You got it, Dr. Argon.
Dr. Argon, I demand an explanation.
You'll forgive me but all the excitement has left me extremely parched.  Poppy?
Susan, I sense you are having difficulty understanding the situation you are presently in.  I ask that you keep in mind that I am ready to reduce an entire city to gelatin to get what I want.
Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
She says it's not.
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
Nebbleman.
You're right.  Place a call to our friends at the network and to Mr. Joplin at the E.P.A.
Do you think she loves him?
Icarus, please!  This is important!
This is what my entire life has been directed at, this moment, this threshold.
Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
That's right.  C.D.C. found out and closed them down...
Opportunity?
Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said, Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you?
Who isn't?
You mean the designs for the nanobot?  You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
So, I guess it worked.
Been out for six months now.
Really?  What have you been doing?
Oh no.  Not by a long shot.  I may look like the old Daniel O'Brien, but on the inside, nothing is the same.
All I'm saying is that the companies that have money for the kind of research you're interested in, have money because that's what they're interested in!  Money!
I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something.
And I'm sure you thought Columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world!
Daniel, I didn't hear you come down...
What did you want my hair for?
Sort of.  We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers.
Where is it?
Yes.
What would happen if I threw him into the core?
That's right.
Yeah, I have something I've been meaning to give you.
Oh yeah?
It's a miracle.
Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
Don't worry, four eyes.
Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
No? Why not?
Well, I tell you, yesterday when I was here, I had one of your books in my hand, and when I got outside, I realized I still had your book in my hand. So as long as I had your book in my hand, I thought I might as well take it home and read it. This morning, I got up and put your book in my hand, and here's your book in your hand.
You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and — 
You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do you think I am? You think I'm going to live here in your house - on your dough?  What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not me!
Oh, I love that nose. It's such a sweet nose.
You wear them of course, silly.
I know that.
Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.
I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile.
I see.
You're acting like a child.
I should say you had. At the rate you two are going, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces.
Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.
You're the Tribune man?
Yale '21, I believe.
I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?
Now get this mug. You've got the kind of chin I just love to touch. And if you don't get out of here, I'm going to hang one right on it.
No, it's just little Bingy Baker.
You've raised it up to the chin, I see.  Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.
No? Well, where were you when that happened?
Now get this, Conroy. My name is Smith. Always was Smith - and always gonna be Smith.
—and that—
And the rest of us are truck horses?
Remember, she's a Schuyler.
Staring at us?
Must be my wife.
To Old Madrid.
I don't know a thing about him, but isn't he the one you're always yelling about?
Right.
And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!
It'll be ready in a minute.
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
Holy jumping swordfish!
No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
Now don't be absurd, Smith—  May I come in?
Thanks. May I sit down?
Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
I don't eat waffles.
Pardon me, madam - but what am I to say to the newspapermen?
Are the cars ready?
About what? Your marriage to Anne!
Have you seen this? 
I know, I know. I waited outside till she went out. She's a very nice lady, but we don't vibrate well together.
That's what I think of it, Bingy!
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
I just putter.
Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
Yes sir.
Well sir, to be a putterer, one's mind must be at ease. A person with a problem could never be a putterer. For instance, sir, a fish can putter in water but not on land because he'd be out of place. An eagle can putter around a rugged mountaintop but not in a cage, because he'd be restless and unhappy. Now sir, if you will pardon me, with all due respect, sir, as a Smythe to a Smith, you are an eagle in a cage.
No. I want to know.
We're in Pleasantville?
What?
I love you too.
But your sister is a fine young woman and she would never do anything for us to be concerned about.
I was in a bowling-alley.
No I'm not.
Um ... It's ...
Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me.
I think ... I might be ill ...
Trust me ...
What are you doing?
We were gonna ... You know ...
It's better, Mary Sue.
I don't believe it.
That's not going to happen!
But it could happen.
No it couldn't!
No. What?
Yes I did.
Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
Oh. guess I could do that, then.
Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.
Hello Mr. Simpson.
The one in your mind. The one that you see on a bright cold morning. The one that you see when you walk in front of your house and you just stand there and stare.
Upstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any STEREO!
I'm not sure.
You--you gotta get us out of here.
What's going to happen?
We're supposed to be in school.
One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
What do you mean?
They don't have that kind of potential.
It's okay.
That's great.
How come I'm still in black and white?
What?
Look, I probably shouldn't be asking you this--not knowing you that well and all ...
Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
It was a prop for the school play ...
... Like Prince Charming.
But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.
Look--it just sort of "happened" ...
Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
Oh no? Let me show you something!
Because you're coming home.
Why don't you just take me back without it?
Well you can just put on the lettuce, finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along.
Yeah.
Open it.
Yeah. TV busted?
Remember the one where Bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?
Somewhere in Utah.
D&D Mattress Man.
Well I don't want to do something like that.
I know.
Did I say that?
I have work, I can't leave.
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
Hi, is this Jack?
Hi. This is Jack.
I'm in my bedroom.
It was cool last night.
No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
They don't get opened until eight.
I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
I'm sorry. I thought you said --
Nothing.
What?
Yes no not really.
Yeah.
So what do I do then?
I don't freak out very often.
OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing?
You don't have a boyfriend or anything do you?
About six months ago. Why?
Yeah......yeah.....
I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
I don't have any business here. I came here for you, I didn't have any business.
Right. Alright, lemme call you first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna run the numbers, see what's what and I'll give you a call back --
For what?
Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
It's fine. I can just get you at your office.
How?
Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
337.....I'm sorry....
Why don't you shut the fuck up?
Fine, thank you.
I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today -- I have to leave today --
Um....I bought one. I thought maybe it would be nice to get dressed for work, can I show you something?
I'll tell you...the guy...with...just talk to me later about it, ok?
You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn?
Where you goin?
Alright: And I have to go and buy some more pudding for this trip to Hawaii and as I just said that out loud I'm realizing it sounds a little strange but it's not. So can you come and help me out?
Yes.
You know, please, I just wanna say that I didn't say I would help her out; I was very clear about it....I don't think that this is fair.....wait, wait, wait, ouch, ouch.....
Are you serious with this?
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
What are you doing?
Yes, yes, right.
I'm only paying two of you guys.
He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --
It's not bad, it's ok.
It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
Will you call me later to talk about asking Walter for the shrink? And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something?
Ok. What should I do about Eric?
No.
It's fine.
He did seem a little strange.
I think he's weird, but that's me.
I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
I hear he's got a whetstone and chisel, and he uses them to sharpen his teeth.
He's a writer, not a madman.
I think she's sweet on him, that's what I think.
He's not the man who's cast a shadow here.
You'd deny a dying man his salvation?
It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
"Part the gates of heaven," as it were --
Valcour. His chair.
-- and your meat shall be de-boned.
What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!
You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
-- the passion in your heart --
AND DID YOU?
Who's to say I did not?
Then it must've been love --
You're a man of Science; I'm a man of God. Charenton stands to profit from us both, I'm certain.
His wife's?
Yes?
Have you tried bleeding him with leeches? The calming chair? Maybe you should flog him at the stake?
You find this amusing, do you?
I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
Of course.
It was not inspired by circumstance.
I'm not the first man God has asked to shed blood in His name. I will not be the last.
Will you sleep soundly tonight?
But I am history.
Of course, Your Highness. Nevertheless... cure the Marquis de Sade... succeed, where countless physicians and priests have failed...
I'll pass the word on, then.
I suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours.
You've already stolen my heart, as well as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator...
He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --
What thought is that?
Now is the time to secure your epitaph. The benevolent Marquise, Charenton's most revered philanthropist... or Satan's Bride.
....shame on you, truly...
It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.
Am I?
Don't insult me with your cute press quotes Save it for Louella.
With about twenty of his spies on my tail. No thanks.
I can't
And director.
Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private lives should not be public property.
Why is that, Louis?
It's not really--
This picture--
There's a different between want and
Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
You are slovenly and unattractive and I won't  t-t-t-tolerate it.
I don't want you to--
There is nothing to understand but this:   I am a man who could have been great, but was not.
Sir? 
That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music--
Nix, sweetie. You shelve it
Oh for God's sake, Louella-
But you keep coming up with the same elitist crap - - HEART OF DARKNESS with a million dollar budget?! - - no one wants to see that.
Butts on seats. That's what movies are about. You got one job in Hollywood -- everyone has the same job, in fact -- putting the butts on the seats. You gotta sell 'em popcorn and Pepsi- cola. It's all about popcorn and Pepsi-cola.
Not for me.
But with compassion and insight--
Who the hell's Manolete?
I don't wanna write about no spic.
The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.
Fuck you
Don't do this
Fuck you--
Why her?
And what does he see?
What?
Craig is one syllable
To my invaluable comrade Drink up!
Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.
I don't care.
He was a drunk. And he was my father and I was ashamed of him.
Hedy Lamarr?
Christ.
They won't let it out. Not Hearst. Not the other studio heads--
You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
Kinda.
Yeah, you're probably right.
Get out
Again
Ah, it's a grand title.
The ad..
"Your movie" -- I am so sick of that! It's your movie -- but it's his life! Did you ever think about that?! Did you ever think about that old man and Marion having to watch as you tore them apart?!
Who the fuck are you trying to kid? You are that soulless monster.
I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back?
Five...? Yes. No. We're done today
Yes!
He's Christ?
Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?
How can he embarrass you?
Make it on his own? Does he know the kind of money involved? I mean the real money. He thinks he's gonna become champ on his own? We're gonna sit by and see some nut come in there and hold one of the most important titles in the world? A nut who don't listen to nobody or respect nobody? Is he really crazy? Listen, Joey, you understand, you tell him. I don't care how great he is or how colorful. He could beat all the Sugar Ray Robinsons and all the Janiros he wants to. He ain't gonna get a shot at the title without us. I'm not askin' you to do another thing except get that message into that thick head!
I don't follow no gamblin' Commissioner. I'm just a fighter.
I want to believe you, LaMotta.
It's not done.
Here's your steak. You can't wait for it to be done. Here.
See that, I don't feel it. I can take it. I know I can take anybody.
Nah, not now... I wanna wait. I don't feel right...
Probably. You know she talks to everybody, and not just him.
Nah, not now -- all those hard-ons around. I'll wait. Not now.
Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.
Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...
What the fuck they want? I took the dive. They want me to fall down too? I don't fall down for nobody. I never went down in my life. Joey, what do I gotta do? Crawl on my hands and knees? I made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' Garden! All the newspaper writers make fun of me. I'm the bum of the year. All I want is a shot. Just a fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do? I'll do anything.
Yeah, except fall down. That's right.
I can't eat a steak. If I eat a steak, I'm gonna have trouble making the weigh-in.
When?
Why didn't you tell me about it?
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
Well, I heard some things.
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
Did you ever fuck my wife?
I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.
Stop it. What're you, crazy?
Does that mean...
You sound bitter.
Just keep your eye on the ball.
Should I hit it?
Go 'head. Do it.
All I did...
You're hurting my arm.
Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
Then what?
All right, just don't make any noise.
What friends?
Yeah, the weight's Ok.
Excuse me for living.
No, you're his wife.
When the lock is broken -- yes.
I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.
You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
Six ayem.
Who left -- where?
Jeff -- huh?
Well -- what good is his information?!! It's a second-hand version of an unsupported statement by the murderer himself -- Thorwald! Anybody actually see the wife get on the train?
I hate to remind you -- but this all started because you said she was murdered. Now did anyone, including you, actually see her murdered?
Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.
I can hear myself starting out. "Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --"  He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes.
One thing I don't need is heckling! You called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer!
A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
For what?
You asked for something dramatically different! You got it!
That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
Yeah.
For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
Then if the police get me -- you won't be around to laugh!
How can you tell that from a thermometer!
She's just not the girl for me.
People with sense can belong wherever they're put.
She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
He and his wife splitting up?
I have a feeling we've just begun.
I handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in New Jersey asleep for the winter.
Would four of them -- ?
There's no point in taking unnecessary chances.  Give me the phone book, Lisa.
Not yet, Jeff.
Anything else bothering you?
I wanted to, Jeff.  Oh!
Well, I'm going to make this a week you'll never forget.
Tired?
She looked very cool. She had on a mint green --
Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?
Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain --
So do I.
Tell me about it.
A lot of things. She's an invalid who needs constant care -- and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there all day.
You could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the streets and the backyard?
Don't you see how silly you're being?
What's the apartment house number?
He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
You'll have to clear that through my landlord --
Lisa, I won't be able to give you any --
I'd be no better than Thorwald, to refuse.
It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
Thank you.
And the last thing she'd leave behind would be her wedding ring!  Do you ever leave yours at home?
Think you've got enough for a search warrant now?
A new disease.
I'm glad they let you out.
I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.
What's eating you, Judy?  You want him alive?
What?
Chicken?
Know the Millertown bluff?
Buzz Gundersen.
Glad to meet you.
Hold it, Jim.
And listen--watch out about the pals you choose--Know what I mean? Don't let them choose you--
It's just this get-up.  The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.
Yes.
The kind we've been talking about. Can you answer me now?
We'll make time.  Where's some paper.  We'll make a list and if we're still stuck then we ought to get some advice--
I just want to show you how foolish you are.  When you're older you'll laugh at yourself for thinking this is so important--
I'm in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction?
That's not what I mean.  I've never done anything right.  I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it.  I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
Well--
You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something  Mom?
You don't?
I think I know my son.
Let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand?  The kid has no friends yet and--
What's that pounding?
Come with me, John.
Well maybe she better start.
Jim.  What's yours?
Plato.  It's a nickname.
He has a knife.
Why don't you come home with me?  I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you?  I don't have many--people I can talk to.
If you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to--  Gee...if you could only have been my father...we could...
Yeah.
No.  I'm scared.
Wowee ow wow!  Let's take it for the summer.
It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
I'm here.
I just have a feeling.  Where are you?
We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.
Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back?
Goodbye, dear.
Wash up and go home.
All the time!  I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up.  I'm going to smash somebody--I know it.
I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
Here.  Look, will you do something for me?  If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.
Okay--
Now that's true!
See?
I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody!  Judy, what am I going to do?  I can't go home again.
There's just one thing.  What about--
Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
You disappointed?
Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
What?
So do you.
He hates me.
Do you think your father means that?
No.
I'll never get close to anybody.
I didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.
GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!
I've been doing good, though.
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
What, he should see me help you catch him?
Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
Ash, you've gotten me enough --
Fifty percent off, motherfucker. Ho ho ho.
For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?
Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants!  I hate him, Nick... you know how...
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike.
Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.
What?
Part of... with them?
Merry Christmas.
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!
I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended I was him! I knew about her letters! Jesus Christ, whatever you want from him -- I'm not Nick!  I -- I just wanted to be --
So you could get down her chimney.
Wish I had a brother like you.
And I worked there. For a year.
Wrong, convict. You walk in there, they recognize you.
More than you know.
You do.
Shut the fuck up. You play what your girlfriend plays. Ashley's going in with you. You talk to her, otherwise you don't talk to nobody. You walk the room as many times as you want, but the second you come out, I want to know the run of the place.
...never... tried...
We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
No.
What, we walking in there and delivering toys?
How'd you know my name...
How'd you know my name was Rudy.
How'd you know my name.
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
Leave the tree.
Capades? They don't do it. Mittens? Outlawed. Why?
Because down there this is money. Up here this is heat.  You wanted Vegas quality, I brought it to you. You wanted Vegas press, I gave it to you. But guys, please, guys... I can't get you Vegas profits... till one of ya does some spirit dance and does something about this snow.
What?
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
No, the place. The remodeling. moving everything around.
Not with you.
He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me.
DROP THE GUNS! NOW!
Haven't thought about it.
Get a hot mug of chocolate.  First thing I'm gonna do.
Yeah.
Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.
Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going.
Tell Ashley... I...
Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley?
Always wanted to rob that casino, Rudy. Way back when I worked there. What better way than to get some guys to rob it for me.
There is no other table --
THEY'LL OPEN ONE!
Now where were we?
Yes.
Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew.
Was he all pissed off?
Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on.
There is no fuckin' set up!  Look, this is the news. Blondie, you stay here and take care of them two. White and Pink come with me, 'cuz if Joe gets here and sees all those fucking cars parked out front, he's going to be as mad at me as he is at you.
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
The Milwaukee Brewers?
Yeah. They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em.
Oh fuck, Toby's that little china girl.
Dead as Dillinger.
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
Blonde, shoot this piece of shit, will ya?
He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.
What for?
Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake. He's a good kid. I understand you're hot, you're super-fuckin' pissed. We're all real emotional. But you're barking up the wrong tree. I know this man, and he wouldn't do that.
You don't need proof when you got instinct. I ignored it before, but not no more.
Mr. Pink.
You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
I don't believe in it.
I don't tip because society says I gotta. I tip when somebody deserves a tip. When somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned, they're just doin' their job.
So's working at McDonald's, but you don't feel the need to tip them. They're servin' ya food, you should tip em. But no, society says tip these guys over here, but not those guys over there. That's bullshit.
Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
Dead.
Let's go in the other room...
Splash some water on your face. Take a breather.
How can you be so sure?
Then where is everybody? I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house. We ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could both be dead or arrested. They could be sweatin' 'em, down at the station house right now. Yeah they don't know the names, but they can sing about this place. I mean, that could be happening right now. As we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin' here this minute.
I swear to god I'm fuckin' jinxed.
Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.
Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.
Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat.
That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
Look, asshole, I'm right! Somebody's a fuckin' rat. How many times do I hafta say it before it sinks in your skull?
Oh, I don't doubt is was quite beautiful -
Don't fuckin' patronize me.
You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
Not these guys.
Yeah, those guys too.
Yeah. Keep a closer eye on her --  And him. Shootin' going on, we'll never find Lednov.
Just about.
Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
His letters will keep.
I'll make the soap myself.
What?
I can't help how I think. You're trained a certain way when you're a kid and you can't change.
Goodbye, Mary.
A fellow sees a fire go out all of a sudden, he don't take chances. My name's Clayton and I'm looking for someone.
No they won't.
A little hot.
Why?
Sure. You'll find it under the wagon seat. Like I said before, a twenty- two's more your size.
I won't again.
I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
Oh... that's the time you went away.
Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder.  Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.
Sure. What other reason would there be?
I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.
Three men on matched roans?
It isn't that --
Just a thing I was workin' on.
The way you act, it must be something pretty secret.
Then why stay in the hills.
Even women?
Go ahead.
Why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in Aspen. I told the man in Sonora there were four of us. If only three show up, he might call the whole deal off. We've got to stick together. Like we've always done.
No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
Maybe you are. I'm not.
Since I can remember, Ma'am.
Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
Would they be good to eat?
Let me do that.
That's always tough. How long were you together?
That's it.
Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.
But he could still be haunting the house. He's angry that he had to leave.
He's so brave.
That we should take our friendship a little further?
Yes...
Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked.
Let's get a hot dog.
That's what your man is supposed to do.
Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.
Are you?
That turned out to be a good thing! It's gonna make smuggling a whole lot easier. Remember that weed? I'm about to get paid.
Any of them hot?
Willing? I like that.  And, this one?
That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.
And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
Sounds good. I'm just going to run up to my room. Hop in the shower. Jump into my jogging suit, and I'll be right there.
What do you know about it?!... Listen, the ghost is too powerful. The only chance we have is to use this machine.  I need you to go get the others and meet us upstairs.
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
Soon. First, I must bless this house.
What?
Shorty, why don't you say grace?
"Fucked me."
Mother? 
Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets.
Well... he was an asshole... but he didn't deserve to die!
Why?
I don't feel like rewinding it!
I know this sounds weird, Mr. Sutphin, but the Department of Motor Vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.
Misty, that's a terrible thing to say!  Detectives, it's time for you to leave. My wife knows nothing about this terrible... accident.
No woman would!
I've identified every little birdie we're going to watch tomorrow on the Eastern Shore.
It's Ok, Eugene. I understand... I'll go fix breakfast. 
Sorry, ma'am.  We're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.
It was her! Beverly Sutphin! Sittin' right there!  I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!!
You bitch!
FUCK YOU! 
Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company. I understand you're having problems with obscene calls.
Yes, I am... I'm sorry Mrs. Wilson... It's driving me crazy... I've changed my number twice already... Please help me!
Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
But... but... she... Rosemary, I heard her voice! It's her, I tell you, IT'S HER!
Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty. 
Rosemary, honey. Good morning. I'm fine.  Thanks for remembering.
Ewwww!  Thank you, Rosemary.
Yes... but... I didn't...
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
Now, here's a babe!
Nice one, huh? Winter's coming.  Three dollars?... I guess that's what I marked it...
Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
I don't know if I want to go with you or not.
No.
But why? She's been ill --erratic, but I've never heard of anything like that!
Hello, Frances.
Nothing.
Yes.
Thank you.. .goodnight.
The important thing is, the police won't believe you.
He was a kind little man in his way —— and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.
The people at the restaurant?
Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things.
Look here, just because Mrs. Romari asked you to amuse us.
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want —- surrender herself to the police —— stand trial —— I don't think he knows.
I have something even better.
I don't know.
Such a simple matter. This figure is the symbol of the Palladists.
It's all clear to me now -- so clear.
You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
I'm a good boy, but no one listens to what I say.
Bella Romari	If I were not seated, I would embrace you in three movements like a sonata.  Ah, my wonderful one. Fly with me tonight. We will take your coffee machine and live with the gypsies.
I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
I've lost my knack.
Uh—huh.
Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet ——	one as a detective.
I'd forgotten.
Tell me where Jacqueline is -— we've got to find her.
Tell me what?
I think it's time.
A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?
I don't know.
It will make you unhappy to find Jacqueline. It would put her in danger --- great danger --
She's not been here for a long time.
Could you let me see that room? If it is hers, there might be something there to help me find my sister.
I don't know no Gibson. This is a restaurant. Many people come here.
No, Nancy.	You've got to sleep two more minutes.
When?
False alarm.
Oh, no problem. It can wait.
Oh.
Oh, uh-huh.
Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
Nine years?
Why? Didn't you know him well?
Thank you.
Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.
Agreed.
I believe in it for some people. I mean, for me it was silly, I was confused going in. So I just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesn't know you intimately.
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.
You had sex with you therapist?
Are you in the middle of something?
I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.
The... interviews are about sex, Ann.
To you?
No, not to me, for me, for the camera.
I'm sorry this came up.
This is just... so...
You know?
She said it on her tape.
It's not my place to tell you these things, Ann. You have to find out by yourself or from John directly. You have to trust me on this.
Yes.
Yes.
You're not like your sister. You couldn't be like her if you wanted to.
I thought I made that clear before, when I said I would go down on you.
If I asked you to, would you? Not on tape, I mean?
Her name was Elizabeth.
I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...
Subtlety?
Interesting analogy.
I don't know. Possibly.
But that was part of it?
Because.
Are you having an affair?
If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.
Always the lawyer.
I want out of this marriage.
Do you have any idea what triggered this concern?
What do you mean?
If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over.
God, no.
So it was recently that you tried this.
Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
That you are under no obligation to me?
Yes.
Yes.
Because all she thinks about are these guys she's after and I just hate her she's such a little slut I thought that in high school and I think that now. Why do people have to be so obsessed with sex all what's the big damn deal? I mean, it's okay and everything, but I don't understand when people let it control them, control their lives, why do they do that?
Jesus, Ann, get a life. I just asked what he looked like.
I have a pretty good idea.
I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...
Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work.
Did he touch you?
I mean, I couldn't do that in front of John, even.
What is it?
Nothing.
You just want to ask me questions?
Whichever you prefer.
My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
How unfortunate. So when did you finally get to see a penis?
I'd like to make another tape.
I never do more than one. I'm sorry.
Who said I was jealous?
I'm intrigued.
How about inviting me over to dinner?
Nothing wrong with trying.
What's so stupid about it?
I like the way he dresses.
Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.
By definition you're lying to Ann, too.
I can't believe I let him stay in my house. Right under my nose. That deviant fucker was right under my nose and I didn't see him.
God, you... you're mean.
You have family here also?
You were prying before?
Where are the tapes, Graham?
What tapes?
You know which tapes! Where are they?
John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property.
I'm not kidding, Graham, you'd better do what I say. Give me those tapes.
No.
Shut up!!!
Mr. Kirkland has asked me to inform you that he has obtained legal representation elsewhere, and that if you have a message for him to leave it with me.
Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.
Hi. Want a drink?
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
You knew these people?
OK. But late.
Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands. That's all.
Nick, you're so strange...
Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?
Gonna cut me open?
You know and I know that Hobbes was a lousy teacher, eh? Lousy. Dry, academic, afraid of women, lousy. But he was always a genius at one thing -- getting grants. Could he get grants for crazy projects?
Rollo, you know me. Once a GP, always a GP.
I don't get it.
IT'S TIME FOR BYE-BYES IT'S BEEN A GREAT DAY THANKS A HEAP NOW IT'S TIME FOR EVERYONE TO GO TO SLEEP
BREAKING OUT
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
Yes, Betty.
Yeah, well.  Here, Betty.  I just came to give you this.
TENDERNESS AND INNOCENCE IN DENTON`
THE ART WILL START WHEN I PLAY MY PART AS THE HEALER WHO WILL STEAL YOUR HEART
Of course.
Who?
He's a lame dog, remember?  But even he wouldn't want to see you like this.
What show?
If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me.
Do you really think so?
But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?
Fast!
YOU'RE NO GOOD
WHAT A JOKE...
We all love Janet...Who do we love?
I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
You guys having fun?
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
Honey, I'm just saying you know I need a little space before the wedding. Isn't that the point of this? Isn't that what we talked about with Dr. Gertler?
I love you.
Bye.
How's the trip?
And?
And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.
Huh.
Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
I'm worried about you, Miles. Do you need some money?
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
Good. How're you?
Not so bad yourself.
Couple of wrong turns.  Thanks to Magellan, here.
100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.
It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free.
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
What color is it supposed to be?
Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it.
It does. Feels right.
This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
No, see, I want both of us to get crazy. We should both be cutting loose. I mean, this is our last chance. This is our week! It should be something we share.
About a month ago. Six weeks.
What?
Cute? She's a fucking hottie. And you almost tell her I'm getting married. What's the matter with you?  Gotta love it. Gotta love it.
Count me out.
What?
Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a movie.
Yeah.
Oh yeah. Sure.
Nope.
What do you think's going on?
Is what the money thing?
He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.
No.
Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me.
You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
Yeah.
Looks like you were in a bad car accident.
What?
That's five clicks, Jackson.
No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
So what the fuck were you thinking?
Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
Me?
That was quite a day yesterday.
No, I'm okay.
See you.
Hey.
It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
Um... yeah but it's more...
Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
Sure.
Yeah.
Okay. See you around.
Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend?
Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.
Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.
Then buy a bottle and go outside.
Quaffable but far from transcendent.
Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
Only for pee or poop.
Why do you talk to mom when you're by yourself?
It tastes funny.
I don't feel much.
...Tell Graham --
Are you going to do this or what?
Yes it was.
They already know we're here.
While they were trying to fix her up, all she kept asking about was you.
They're right behind the door.
Me too.
It's getting stronger.
I know.  We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham.
I have some upstairs.
I just asked his name.
What's that?
Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
It's like War of the Worlds.
There's nobody coming?
Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie.
Have to.
McKendrick's men got him.
Goodbye?
How's Mr. Parker doing?
And you're not Baxter, either?
In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
I had to get up anyway.
Looks like that's not all they admired.
Yeah, maybe a bath.
Oh, I was just checking the, ah...  ...you know, lookin' in.
Pleased to meet you, Sheriff.
Tomorrow we're going to town to straighten that out once and for all. The next day we'll be back here... farming. And these cattle better be gone.
I don't believe in luck. I know what Conrad was like. Don't tell me what you think I want to hear.
I want to build something, make things grow. That takes hard work -- a lifetime of it. That's not why men come to a pretty woman.
Right!
Let's get out of here.
Howdy.
We're going to make some adjustments. I wanted you to be here when I offered Paden your job. I think he could do it without getting greedy. Stella and I are tired of you skimming our profits.
I'm done talking. Get out.
We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.
We'd rather stay.
You're kidding.
It's none of your business.
I don't have any family any more.
I heard that too.
So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
You've got a legitimate job.
It is that.
Here he comes right now.
I meant, seemed like a lot of whiskey.
He left me.
You better get in there with her until this thing is over.
No, I understand.  That's what I want to talk about.  I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once.
I think he owes more to you.  But that's not important now.  I know what's going on between you two.
You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone.  I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.
I'm not --  He's not.
-- I'll tell you why.  It is because Miss Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card God's gift to cinema, has it written into her contract that all cherry Mike & Ike's be removed from her candy dish along with strict instructions that any room she walks into should have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her three of them opened, that there be a personal jacuzzi within eighty paces of her dressing room, and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first class.
Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
How can I?  Your last three pictures tanked.  The board is giving me hell.  No bankable star will work with you after this.  If you just compromised... a little.
They're yours.  But how are you going to finish it?  Without a star there's no movie.
I don't need a star.  All I need is an actor -- I'll reshoot the part, cut out Nicola and replace her with a real actor.  A real leading lady.
Good to see you too, Elaine.
As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
No problem.  Do you want to come in?
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
Even the fall from the plane.
-- We have to talk to her, Viktor!
Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start.
It's a crowded summer.  We need every photo-opp, sound-byte and column inch we can get.  Good night, Viktor.
I can imagine.
Not quite.
Impossible.
I just read somewhere --
I know.  I know.  They'll say anything.
Obviously, this can't last.  She's going to dump him.  Viktor won't be able to take that.  He's too sensitive.  It'll destroy him.
No, thank God for you, Mr. Taransky.  How many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?
And what may I ask brought this on?
Hello, Hal.
You never were together, Hal.
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
But she's right there!  I must feel her!
What's that?
We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
Really?  Who?  Where do you meet them?  In a chat room?  How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?
I read.
-- I know, I don't know anything.
I'm sure you'd tell me if you thought it was important.
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
There you go again, blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone.  I've got to go, Dad.
This is the story.
I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed.  It gets cold out here at night.
I'd like to see that, Sayer. Invite me.
It's a yacht.
I know what you're up to.
I don't buy the whole recluse scam. How are you doing it?  What is it -- drugs?  Blackmail?  Mind-control? All three?  What do you do -- keep her locked in a box somewhere?
I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.
I will when you're finished writing it.
I don't understand.
-- Is this about the new pages? -- I made the changes you wanted, you're in virtually every scene --
It's not the size of the role, Viktor.  Am I or am I not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?
Yes.
You could play the lead.
Good.
She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.
Do you have any idea what this means, Simone?  Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
And now look what you've started. And now look what you've started. And now look what you've started.
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
Thanks.
I work with young people who might be sad or upset or just want to talk. I try to help them figure things out.
Congratulations.
How do you draw now?
That I'm a freak.
Yeah. Sorry.
She died a long time ago.
Words.
You just kept the penny in that hand the whole time...
No gas... Hey, that's good.
I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk.  I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.
Cats?
And the tiny hairs on your arm. Are they all standing up?
Yes.
We're not gonna start crying again, are we?
What do those ghosts want when they talk to you? Think real careful now, Cole...
Lots of things.
You'd cry. Cause you miss grandma so much.
Don't get mad.
Standing next to my window.
Got it.
She wanted me to tell you, she saw you dance.
S-ssstop that!
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
It's our pleasure.
Chuck E. who?
Chicken blood on the crops.
See?
I happen to be a professional.
The band.
Missed you at church this morning, Jeremiah.
Manure... is life.
It harvests! It threshes! Look at these blades.
"Blood?"
I don't think so.
Not while you're driving.
Yeah. Our own. I don't see why we got to go along for the ride.
Down boy.
He started it.
Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!
Yeah. Sure. I'm screwing up the song. You're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off.
Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
Which means we've got ONE week to start acting like a professional band.
About what?
Nah. Just you.
Spider.
What'll we do?
Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
Hell, Starla. I always regretted that.
You took Bill.
Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
You're my princess, aren't you?
I got a super--special birthday present for you this year. I couldn't risk you finding it, so I had to put them locks on the doors.
It's just one of my students, Grant.
Through a wound on his stomach?
Well, if your breath is as sweet as your personality, I got a lot to look forward to. Adios.
I can make it to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours... that's no sweat.
Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle.
Seriously?!?
You just passed your nemesis.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
You know, you're not a bad passenger.
A Texas Bear in Arkansas.  Something's up and at this point in my life, I don't want to know what it is.
Ciao.
Like what?
You want to lose this putz or not?!?
Then let's change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing?
I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
Is that any way to talk to your ole partner?  Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way.
Running blocker.
Two is one.  Listen, let's just stay on the odd channels and switch everytime. Start in the basement. Now, let's haul ass.
Pull your hammer back, Smokey's coming at you.
Right. Give me your pen. We'll tell 'em to bill Kyle.
On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
If I knew, Cledus; I'd be on College Bowl.
Do I have a choice?
I ran into complications.
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
Yeah, but...
Thanks much, Silver Tongued Devil.
Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.
If that sumbitch was in the race, he'd be in the winner's circle by now.
Chickenshit money.
-- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
-- Yeah, I heard. But they won't hold him for long. Anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money.
Maybe he's that good. Never been caught, no criminal record.
Based on what we had, I thought Sparazza was a mid-level player at best and it turns out he's this mob relic, running the show out west.
Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.
All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
Did the Justice lawyers sign off?
Have them mobilized. I'll phone security and have the elevators locked down and stairwells secured. We need to keep Israel sequestered in that penthouse.
Wait a minute, what other agent?  What other agent?
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
That's not possible. I told you.
Shit, if you're on a crazy jag, why stop there, why not take Fort Knox with a fucking slingshot or go into Hell after Hitler... I like your chances a lot more.
No, what did you say on the machine?
I left him a message.
I -- uh, yeah, I guess, yeah.
That's right! RIGHT NOW!
I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
I thought Heller was a double op?
What are you doing here?
-- Okay... hang on, I gotta move --
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
Good. This thing's on track, looks like it's gonna get done.
Cold blood Sid, dead eyes, y'know?
A Fed? Like FBI?
Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'?
No, but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --
Leave the light off.
You're being tricked.  Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field.  Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth.
A puppet.
The same thing that could happen to any of us.
Her?  Who are you talking about?
Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
Why, who did you see?
Who was it?
I don't know.
-- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
No.
You do, you don't.  She's willing to give her life, you're willing to give yours, it's touching and magnificent, anything you want but -- this isn't the place for it.  Don't you see?  No, you don't.
I'll be right back.
Yes.
When I saw you were gone I got scared.
I been thinking about how much I hate you.
I don't know.  I couldn't understand why you didn't tell me.
Good.  Because I want you to know. I really like fucking you.
I'm glad.
Stop.
Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.
Not this time.
Then you'll die.
I want every second I can get with you.
Thank you.
Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.
Chris --
I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.
Am I really her?
When?
He won't.
Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
Can we go then?
Queens... You know Queens?
I'll come with you.
Listen, that was my fault.
Yeah.  It was.
I'll miss you, Mike...
No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...
Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct.
No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really.
Long enough.
Yeah.  It's all over.
Your what...?
What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
Let 'em eat their hearts out.
Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
I might stop you.
I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...
Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
What about Tommy?
You apprehended him after he gave himself up --
I asked for the man in charge...
Is she injured?
She met some friend of Aunt Millie's who works for a record company.  He thinks she's got a great voice.
We're gonna pass the street.
Shooting.
Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a Milky Way.  Anyways, I was never much for, ya know, discipline.
Oh, sure.
Hm.  What a lump.
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
Why home? The real world beckons, man!  The possibilities are endless.  Want to go up to the World Trade Center and laugh at New Jersey?
You print pictures of Bigfoot!
Mr. Jameson--
No!  Now get outta my face, kid.
Frmpph-yrr.
A spider.  Eight legs.
Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
What if the world ends tomorrow?
I hate--
"Flash," Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself "Flash."
I think I'd like that.
I know what you mean.  I...
Ssh.  I always thought she was a strong person.  She is-- but not for the reasons I thought.
Strong...
Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
So you've found Thorkel?
Waldos.
You sure about all this?
That's the understatement of the year.
No.
Aunt May, what happened?
How is he?
I don't care.  Cretin.
I will finish what I've begun…
Ach, theories!  This was first hand, experiential knowledge, the essence of the universe.
Actually, I got this spider bite…
Really, Professor, I--
No, thank you.  I'm sure you've got your own problems.
I don't think I'll be running into him.
Nah.  The big mask was better.
Imagine how I feel.
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
Coming up.
In this barracks?
A lot sharper, Sefton! I'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers!
Maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh, Duke?
Why not?
We're looking at it.
Okay, Security -- what happened?
How much more do we have to take from him?
Only he ain't quite finished yet. Blondie -- get that smudge pot. Tie it to Steve's leg.
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?
I'll live.
No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.
Of course you did! Twenty-six carloads of munitions gone off like a trick cigar! The S.S. is running around in circles. The Gestapo is arresting the wrong people. And von Scherbach has caught the fish. Most amusing, isn't it?
What exactly is he charged with?
Jawohl?
Animal! Animal! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? A couple of guys are trying to escape and you're thinking of broads. Broads?
I don't care if they wear galoshes!
You want Betty Grable!
Betty Grable!
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
No?
How? Pinky Miller from Barrack 8 tried to get over there and they shot him in the leg!
You did?
She'll never forgive me!
Blind? How stupid can you get, Animal? I drank the stuff myself.
Hey, Animal! Animal!
No. I want to draw.
Curtains would do wonders for this barrack.  You will not get them.
Take some men and get the antenna going. Let's see if we can catch the BBC.
You have elected me Security. The way things have been going in this Barracks, I guess I've done a poor job and I want to make up for it. Is that asking too much?
What radio?
Borscht?
We did it.
Look, Sefton, I had my hands full so they wouldn't tear you apart --
Check.
Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
What about the radio?
Are you questioning me?
Just getting acquainted. Trying to make one friend in this barracks.
A lot of people say that and the first thing you know is they get married and live happily ever after.  I wonder what they're trying to pull out there?
Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
Good morning, Schulz. And how's Mrs. Schulz? And all the little Schulzes?
Here. Take them.
The Kommandant also sends you clean blankets. He wants every man to have a new, clean blanket.
I don't know. He bathed, now he is roaming the ship. He must be the only Engineer in Starfleet who does not go to Engineering!
No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling.
The destruction of the Amargosa star has altered the gravitational forces throughout the sector. Any ship passing through this region will have to make a minor course correction.
And destroy every planet in the system.
Population?
During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
We better get you back to the ship  La Forge to Enterprise.
I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
Signal the closest starship. We're in no condition to mount a rescue. We don't even have a full crew aboard.
On screen.
Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.
But why destroy a star?  Thank you, Guinan.
I don't understand.
I told you, time has no meaning here. If you leave, you can go anywhere, any time.
It's our pleasure.
Better?
I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
I thought you might.
What's normal?
I was ordered to by the Captain.
No.
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
Bad food, brutal discipline.  No women.
Make it so.
Well, I appreciate your concern, but I'd rather not discuss it right now, thank you.
All right, all right. You've made your point.
Thank you.
Lock phasers and return fire!
Plasma coils...is there any way we can use that to our advantage?
Right. And they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds.  Data,lock onto that plasma coil.
Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
Thank you... <u>Sir</u>!
Underground deposit?
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.
Spock's burial robe.
It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
That may be difficult...
Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
And Spock with it. They are joined together.
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
I'll go...
No!... I'll do it.  Give me your phaser.
You said there wouldn't be any.
Do you have an explanation?
Request permission to beam aboard immediately.
None that I can detect, sir.
Come, come, Scotty. Young minds. Fresh ideas.  Be tolerant.
Thank you, Mr. Scott. I'll try not to take that personally.  My friends... I can't ask you to go any further. Dr. McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not.
You would have done the same for me.
Because... the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many.
Very well.  Mr. Chekov, I need pre-approach scan... Take the science station, please.
I'll need it, Sulu.
Mr. Scott: as good as your word.
What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov?
Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in.
Hmm.. Very odd.  Scotty. Progress report?
Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
May I ask why...?
Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.
Yours...?!
Who I am is not important. That I have them is.  I will let you speak to them.

You should take the Vulcan, too.
But, why?
Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
Yes...
... Or the one.
You will find a way, Kirk. If you honor them both, you <U>must</U>.
Great power... to control... dominate... destroy. If it works.
I only meant, my lord, that if it's prisoners you want --  There are life signs on the planet. Perhaps the very scientists you seek.
But sir! Federation Starship approaching.
Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.
Our mission is over. I have failed... A human has been bolder and more ruthless than I...  That -- is the real dishonor.
Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor.
Exactly. Happy birthday.
I can spare me...
How can you think of food at a time like this?
We have received new orders. Upon our arrival at Regula I, all materials of Project Genesis will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing at Ceti Alpha VI.
... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
Jim please --
And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...
Starfleet has kept the peace for a hundred years, I cannot and will not subscribe to your interpretation of this event.
I'm Doctor Marcus!
No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
Mainly.  And also that I'm proud -- very proud -- to be your son.
Let them eat static.
We can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. We must withdraw!
I shall avenge you --
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
Admiral --
My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space.
Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power.
Aye...
She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
Yes, we've been through death and life together.
I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.
How far?
Really, Dr. McCoy; you cannot ban the acquisition of knowledge because you distrust the moral implications of what you learn. Logic suggests --
And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area...
Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
Aye sir --
Be careful, Jim...
Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power...
Yes, sir.
You may ask, Lieutenant.
<u>WHAT</u>?
Aye, sir.
Scotty!
Try again.
Ready, sir.
To Earth. To offer testimony.
Why don't I?
I mean <u>him</u>, back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters.
If you have a better idea - now's the time.
Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
... My shoes...
Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?
You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
No, Spock. It means he feels safer about your "guesses" than most other peoples facts.
Yes, under "U.S. Government." Now we need directions.
I have the coordinates of the reactor...
The top of what?
My name?
Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm:
We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
Communicate? Communicate what? You have no right to be here!
Is there something wrong with the one I have?
You've already been that. C'mon.
In fact, we may be able to help -- in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine.
... Who are you?
Right.
Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in...
It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
Thank you. For everything.  Beam me up, Scotty.
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
Is there any other planet where this species exists?
Yes, sir.
283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...
On screen.
Humpbacked - people.?
Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
Oh I see --  Tell Them phasers on stun. Good luck. Kirk out.
Mr. Sulu, if you please.
I will. Can my assistant come, too?
I notice you're still working with polymers.
Oh, here and there.  I flew something similar in my Academy days.
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
There are caves in those mountains.
I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
Really.
Why not...?
It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
Yes. But look at this medscan...
Safer than leaving her here.
From the mission...
Will the structure hold if we blast through?
It is not over.
Understood.
In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...
Our partners are nothing more than petty thugs.
Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this.
If we could lure him away from the bridge...
... had regenerated.
The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
That's your expert opinion?
Options?
Nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey...
You Klingons never do anything small, do you...
Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That'll get his attention.
The metaphasic radiation in those rings is in a state of extreme flux. Steer clear of them, Mister Worf...
Prepare to enter the atmosphere... we'll use the ionospheric boundary to shake him...
They're composers, Worf, from the nineteenth century. Data was rehearsing a part in H.M.S. Pinafore before he left...  "A British tar is a soaring soul, As free as a mountain bird, His energetic first should be ready to resist A dictatorial word..."
Decloak the holo-ship and engage a tractor beam, Mister Worf.
Better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums...
Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
What you're doing to my neck...
... I'm not sleeping well...
All ship functions are off-line.
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
Not yet.
It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
What a cold description... for such a beautiful gift.
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
No.
The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.
Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery.
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.
Today is March second, 2063. The time in Montana is oh-eight-forty- five.
I told you, there's no --
I have the password right here.
There should be some kind of manual release...
Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
What's still there?
There's a red light on the second intake valve.
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force.  And you are?
Jean-Luc Picard.
Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
Thank God this plate was already fixed.
Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
You'd have to try real hard. No one's used currency in over ten years. What are you, from another planet?
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.
On screen.
We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.
Western hemisphere... North American continent...
On screen.
Life signs?
Can't tell. Long-range bio- sensors are off-line.
Then make it so. Have you determined how to recreate the temporal vortex?
Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.
We have to cover both possibilities.  We'll take care of the Bridge. Worf, take your men and seal off Main Engineering. Turn it into a fortress -- nothing gets in.
I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
I'll bear it in mind, Admiral. I think that's all.
Fascinating...
Thank you, nurse. Jim, she's ready! Lock and load!
I wish I knew. Uhura?
We're not finished.
Are we playing multiple choice?
Still think we're finished?
More than ever.
If they did we'd all have to turn ourselves in. How CAN we rely on them?
We were until your torpedoes!
I beg your pardon?
Take them away.
Yes.
Those words WERE spoken by me.
I have on occasion disobeyed orders.
Uhura, monitor!
What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
Kill him! He's the one!!
And your coat.
Anything else you want to tell me?
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
Candidate for what?
Captain, may I remind you that regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock?
Only don't try putting words in my mouth.
You hear that?
You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain.
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
Not for the actions of another. No one is responsible for any actions but his own. Human beings -
Spock, you want to know something?
I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
Not as yet, sir.
In nineteenth century France, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by machines, flung their wooden shoes - called SABOTS - into the gears to stop them. Hence the word SABOTAGE.
Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
That could take hours!
At present, he's surrounded by a magnetic shield. If my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his escape planning by this time.
No. My name is Data... I am your brother.
No.
He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.
But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.
Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...
Well. I suppose it does a bit. I'm very happy for them, of course, but I'm going to miss them. The ship will seem... incomplete without them.
I can see that.
Why?
Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.
Why is it moving?
The resemblance is... striking.
As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
How could I not?
Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.  I need you at my side. Now more than ever I...
Counselor?
No!
What do we know about the population?
That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.
Deanna, on my mark.
Won’t do what, Mister Worf?
What sort of signature?
On screen.
Thank you, sir...
Sir --
A coup d'etat?
It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.
Yes.
You know I do.
As happens so frequently here on Romulus, a new government came to power. They decided to abandon the plan -- frankly, I think they were afraid I'd be discovered and it would lead to war. They weren't ready for that.
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
Were we always explorers?
Yes.
New worlds.
I won't defend my life to you.
It amazes me how little you know yourself.
Long ago.
Don't you think it's time to surrender? I'll have my cloak back in a matter of minutes and your poor ship is shot to pieces. Why should the rest of your crew have to die?
Should I raise shields?
I came this far alone ...
I thought we discussed patience, Commander.
It's there. The fog's thicker now, but it's there. What do you think started those fires?
We should have. Let me see.
Eh... yes.
Where's that?
Shermin, I want you and Bell to start looking for the one on the ground.
None. And there's another one in the area that's alive. I don't know if it's the only one. I don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva...
I don't like it, George...
I'm gonna be here if you need anything.
I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.
I've never been taken off an assignment in my life. Give me twenty- four hours and I'll have him for you.
You can change a directive, George. You've done it before. Listen to me. He's going somewhere in Death Valley. Lathrop Wells was never anything but a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. There are no roads in there. She was teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling you. We block the four roads into Death Valley and we got him.
We'll do that. But how are we going to hold him? He can change himself into a man. He can disappear.
That's the chance we have to take.
Then you're going to have to do it without me.
What?
If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
Watch it. They're coming out.
What.
Smile.
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...
What are you doing?
Gas good?
You want to try it?
I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep...
No.
I feel like I'm going crazy here. You're Scott. But he's dead. I don't know what's real anymore. I can't be here with you.
No... The closest...
'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
Then don't be smart.
Not every car, but... a car will stop... Maybe not the first car... maybe number eight, number fifteen...
Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
Yes?
A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
I don't know.
Don't be afraid... I'd really like to hear it.
You can have one.
I will go. But not you.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
I will. I will. We still have another day.
You promised.
We'll get a ride in the morning.
You don't make money gambling. You lose it.
I want to gamble.
You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
I will wave to you.
He's kidnapping me!!!
He doesn't understand... just walk away...
Would be kinda neat if they were. I think I could outrun them. Maybe get my picture in the papers.
Pull over. I've got to get back there.
Don't worry. I'll be all right.
Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like that?
Did your people have any contingencies rehearsed?
Save us all a lot of trouble.
Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
Can you see under the faceplate?
We better get it into the box. Come on...
I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't
Just not the eyes.
Yeah, right.
You're too goddamned paranoid.
A tragic story, no doubt.  How'd you get up here?
Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
You talked to Iris?  When?
That's a good one, coming from you.
Damn right.
Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
No.  Mace is in this.
What a nightmare.
Talk to me about costs, here.
Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
Yeah.  No, not really.
And he records it.  Thrill kill. Wants to see it again.  And again.
W'sup, Max?
I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.
Okay... what about Strickland?
This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig.
Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
I always do.
Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
Mr. Fumitsu, good evening sir, Leonard Nero, Security Express. Lornette Mason here is just completing our routine driver evaluation.  We do it to make sure that out VIP clients, such as yourself, are always treated as honored guests.  I just need to ride up front and take some notes, if you don't mind.
Coming with you.
No, you're just trying to get off.
Look, I gotta get some sleep.
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
And what about the guy that was following me?
It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case...
The gas tank's going to go any second!
Uh unh.  I won't do it.
Why?
To break the trail.  If those cops had gotten hold of her, they would have beat it out of her who she was wearing for, and then gone after them too.  Our killer is running as scared as we are.  Which makes him really dangerous.  Judging by how scared I am.
Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.
Why didn't he just go public with the tape?  Save himself that way.
Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that.
No.  It didn't.
I still got one ace to play.  Tran's got what I want... and I've got what he wants...
No.
Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
You got that right. Low became obsessed with the Green River murders, the case had been inactive for ten years at that point. He argued the Green River Killer had actually become Suspect Zero, this master murderer who killed without pattern, killed literally hundreds of victims -- male, female, old, young, straight, gay -- and who was still killing, even though there were no bodies. It went against everything we knew. Low became increasingly paranoid. Every suspect was potentially Suspect Zero. Anybody tried to talk sense into him, he'd accuse them of being out to get him. Deputy Director Koessler was "out to get him." The decision was made to relieve him.
Well, the victim was killed at the turn-around over there, then his car was pushed over here...  ...right across the state line. That makes it Federal. This is Officer Wallace, he's out of Alamogordo.
You're thinking...?
Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response.
Her body turned up. In a Minnesota cemetery. They brought her back.
I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
I'm sorry. This won't take long.
I have 6 tons.
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
Not as much as you'd think.
Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
Just an observer.
Speck. Harold Speck.
I'm hesitant to...
I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
There was talk of a file photo.
You better hope the Director doesn't stop abruptly one day, David, you might break your nose.
How did a girl like me end up in a place like this?  The Deputy Director here, he believes in Tough Love. A cop's cop. Shape up or ship out, righto? Agent Kulok, when you get a chance you might want to check the victims of the recent serials. You'll find that some of them have been credited to other killers, some years ago. That's a Dave Koessler trick, find a pliant sociopath, preferably a dead one, attribute to him unsolved cases, clean up the backlog-looks great in the yearly report.
They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. I'm on my best behavior. I've got to watch what I say.
This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
This is some serious shit.
You got a point there.
I saw him on a talk show once, talking about these killers like they were his friends. Not the victims, not the families of the victims, he doesn't talk about them. Blood money, that's what it is.  Did he hit on you?
You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.
No. Cut off while he was still alive, look at his wrists, damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free. Must have been screaming real loud when the killer chain-sawed his throat. Unfortunately, he'd soundproofed his van.
Sue Ann Hanson.
I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.
I just need to go a little slow.
Jaime? Where are you?
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
Start killing people for real?
When you exit, head east on 10th.
He's moved on to TV.
I already have an employer.
Whatever happened to MyDick?
[Follow me.]
[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
What did you do to end up here?
Speck is dead.
He wants us to know he's out there, what he's doing. It's not enough just to kill somebody like Speck, he wants us to know he did it.
That's because it was a challenge. You has control over you're situation. It was hard, but you rose to it.
You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
You're a comedian?
Are you sure? Maybe...
You better pay the man.
Tell me about it...
It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.
You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?
I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...
Why not? This place is dead anyway.
Yeah, I'll tell her I don't remember and then I'll ask what she looks like.  Then I'll ask if we fucked. How's that, Tee? Is that "the money"?
...Four days..?
What an asshole.
I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
It's a rebound.
We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.
Well... You can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone's watching you.
Hi, Mike?
How are you doing?
Fine... I guess. You?
So I don't call either way.
Hey man, don't sweat it.
It's definitely a step back for me.
Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.
I don't talk about her that much.
Oh no?
Well, until now. Tend the pin.
It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing. It's kinda cool. It's like you're in on some kind of secret. You tell a chick you've been some place, it's like bragging that you know how to find it. The only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there. You have to have someone come before. There is a direct line connecting you back to the original, unequivocally cool, club patrons. It's kinda like Judaism...
Bud.
I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
Darwinism at its best.
I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.
There's the rub.
Him?
At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy...
...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
You always know the right thing to say.
Give me the money. I'll get it.
...He's derivative...
I can't believe you.
...Whatever. You're like a whining little woman. Big deal. You got a fuckin' number. Whoopee! You'll fuck it up...
Hi, Nikki. Mike. I don't think this is working out. I think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. It's not you, really. It's me. It's only been six months...
I don't know...
We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? It makes me want to puke.
When?
I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
I'm not going to Vegas.
Just bring your card. Half an hour.
Be downstairs. You're beautiful.
Vegas!
Look at it, baby. Vegas, baby!
Tee, the beautiful babies don't work Wednesdays midnight to six. This is the skank shift.
Baby, don't talk like that, baby.
Okay, Tee's the asshole, but Mikey's the big winner.
What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
I don't think so.
I don't know...
...gotta...
Oh fuck that. You don't have to try and impress anyone. You think I give a shit? You think I sweat that skanky whore waitress...
They know what you want, believe me. Pretending is just a waste of time. You're gonna take them there eventually anyway. Don't apologize for it.
No! Not the camera guy!
Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time.
She was hot.
That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
...a day...
I hear she's getting real fat.
No. Doesn't that suck?
It starts at eight...
...It looked money.
Yeah. I guess you could call it that.
What an asshole. Didn't you see "Boys in the Hood"? Now one of us is gonna get shot.
...shivering...
You're money.
...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think?
Don't listen to him. You call whenever it feels right to you.
Be smart about it.
You don't have to wait three days...
Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.
What do you want of me?  I'll give you anything you want, but do what I ask!
Some day, and that day may never come, I would like to call upon you to do me a service in return.
I swear I'm innocent.  I swear on the head of my children, I'm innocent.  Mike, don't do this to me, please Mike, don't do this to me!
OK, OK.  You gonna make me something to eat at least?
No, just you and Paulie.
So.  I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection.  No worries about operations, is that what you tell me?
And with prison record.
I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
Tom said he'd take care of it.
For killing a man.
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
You want him to stay in this country.
Godfather, you understand everything.
Beautiful all over, eh?
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse.
Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
And when they shot me father...
Yes, even the shooting of your father was business, not personal...
I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
No.  I guess I'll see you Christmas. Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right?
Not so perfectly if you noticed.
Yes.  Tell me.
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
Michael, I love you.
My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in.  He's a good lawyer.
No.
Tell me you love me.
I don't think so either.  I better go.
No, you eat...don't wait up for me.
Don't ask me.
Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.
Theresa.
That's not how Pop would have played it.
I know I'm not the man he was.  But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.  When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
All right, Sonny.  All right.
Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to pick you up in an hour and a half on Times Square, under the big Camels sign.
Probably a year...
Yes, I promise.
He talked to you?
Sure. Any time.
And be careful in the sun. Your gray's in danger of turning a little pink.
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
Shut up!
It's vile.
Then I'll go to your place and you can move in with Tom.
I hope it wasn't cheap.
You know, a primer.
Marge! You've got to hear this!
Sure. I love Venice.
Like Clark Kent.  Now Superman.
I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...?
I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
Sure -- I know, that's too dangerous for you, fair enough, hey! we're brothers, fine, then you do this sordid thing with Marge, fucking her on the boat while we all have to listen, which was excruciating, frankly, plus you follow your cock around like a -- and now you're getting married! I'm bewildered, forgive me... you're lying to Marge then getting married to her, you're knocking up Silvana, you've got to play sax, you've got to play drums, which is it, Dickie, what do you really play?
Listen, just take one of mine when we get back. Don't worry about it. I did the Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is enough in anyone's life.
Marge-maintenance.
Who is it?
He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't get a cable or a call or a note or, frankly, a fart.
In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.
Far cry from New York.
Hello, sir.  Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
Frances?
My fiancée.
Didn't Dick say? -- He talked to Freddie... apparently it's not going to work out --  Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
That's a terrific idea.
I can explain.
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
How would you know that?
He's not coming till the morning. Evidently his stomach -- I don't think the food here is agreeing with him.
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.
What?
I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer.
Peter Smith-Kingsley? I haven't seen him in months. No, I'm alone. 
A ragione. A ragione. 
Ten thirty?
Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow.  It's really good to meet you.
Not at all. Morning Tom.
Hi.  Sorry. You okay? You look as if you've seen a ghost...
That Dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport. I know, ridiculous.
Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome.
But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody...
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
You try. You try talking to her.
I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me.
I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's my, that's my -- terrible and alone and dark -- and I've lied about who I am, and where I am, and so nobody can ever find me.
Does he stay with you here?
I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
You can't carry in a cab even with a permit -- so why bother?
Sure, here, take this card, go to this place and give 'em the card. They'll charge you, but there won't be any hassle.
It's hell out there all right. A real shit-eatin' war. I'll say this, though: It's bringing a lot of fantastic guns. The market's flooded. Colt automatics are all over. 
Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President.
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
After this job, I'm looking forward to being alone for a while.
The moon?
He'll, what else can I do with it all?
I'm getting a taxi.
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
Just what?
Awh, come off it, Pal.
No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola -- without ice -- and a large buttered popcorn, and...  ...some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a box. They last.
That's fine.
That's a dollar forty-seven.
The kind with a brush.
Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
Look who's talking?  Who else would stay up all night to catch the morning rush hour?
For a fee.
And the kid says, "Yeah. She's about 19, good-lookin." McCall says, "What can I tell you?"
I drive a taxi. You tried to get away one night. Remember?
Don't you want to go?
I was stoned. That's why they stopped me. When I'm not stoned, I got no place else to go. They just protect me from myself.
That's not hard to do.
He looks like a killer.
He's worse than an animal. Jail's too good for scum like that.
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
You a narc?
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
There must be something...
There's porno theatres for that.
Why do you ask?
I've seen a lot of suspicious-looking people around here today.
Oh?
O.K., cowboy.
Show it to me.
Carla Pestalozzi?  No. Definitely not.  You could have posed for the Mona= Lisa.  Sophia Loren looks Swedish next to you.
Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it.
I'm not the chemical weapons expert.
You knew?  All this time?
Hi.
Thanks, I like it.  I think.
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
That's my girl!  Did you...?
Honey, I... I can't... it's the...
Be a gentleman.  You have to help me down.
What did... what did I want to be?
Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.
Yeah...
We've done this before, so many times.  The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
Have you got a cigarette?
Oh.
Delly.  I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father.  And I'm not... I'm not Luke.
I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident."
Yes it does.
Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party.
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
Give the man a hug, boy!  That's your father!
The Jimmy Stewart picture?  I remember that one.  Saw it over at the Bijou.  So, you remember that, huh?
That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
Bought the bottle, didn't I?  To the United States of America. Long my she wave.
Zackly.
Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.
Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up.
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
Lucky you got out, that water's got quite a pull, and it empties straight into the ocean.
Thanks.
I... no, I... I just can't...
Huh?
That's not the country Luke fought for.
Luke didn't smoke.
Well, then, why do they call you "Old Tim?"
They will.  They w-w-will.
Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.
You're leaving after you see Cathy?
Well... something like that.  I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
How do you like our little hamlet?
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
It's what you said, Mom. Mr. Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.
If your father were here...
Mom, they're in a cage!
They're birds!
Take them.
Did you put the cover on that cage, Mom?
Why are they trying to kill people?
I wish I could say. But if I could answer that, I could also tell you why people are trying to kill people.
Try my best.
Yes, but where?
And the white house?
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
The two kids?
Of course.
That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?
I hardly think either species would have the intelligence to launch a massed attack. Their brain pans aren't large enough for such...
Shall I call the doctor?
In a bird shop.
I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
I know, Mother.
Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
I don't know.
I mean. I want to...
Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
They won't be.
If they are?
You don't have to.
I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
Annie's there. She'll be all right.
I wish I could be that way.
And locked it.
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
Didn't know how he got in there. Had a broken leg, turned out. Just fluttering all around there. 
We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army uses.
Yes.
Yes. I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?
Bodega Bay? Where's that?
I'm awfully sorry.
Well... yes, sir, there are.
No, of course not.
Those are canaries, Miss.  Doesn't this make you feel awful?
I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
All right.  She smiles back.
You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?
I am.  Good day.  Madam. 
Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
Why would I want to see you, of all people?
I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and...
What?
I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
Oh. That. Rome.
No.
But you tore it up.
Why?
Cheers.
Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
Like what?
On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
On Thursdays I have my meeting and lunch.  I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and... things like that. 
I'll get it.
I think I should, don't you?
Really? Tell me about it.
It's an uprising.
Well, they'll go along with anything.
Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
We've got to get Cathy.
I... I don't think so. If we get through town, I think we'll be all right.
No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.
They're different, Daddy.  Thank you.  I think these were crows. Yes, hundreds of them. Yes, they attacked the children, attacked them.  Daddy, a little girl was sent to the hospital in Santa Rosa. Well, all right, but you act as if I'm... all right, all right.  No, I can't come home now. I just can't, Daddy. How is it there? I mean... are there birds? In the sky? But no trouble. Well, I hope...  I don't know when. I simply can't leave now. Tell Mother not to worry. All right, Daddy, good-by.
Birds are not aggressive creatures, Miss. They bring beauty to the world. It is mankind, rather, who...
I like Bodega Bay as well as any man. If I thought... 
Can we go on living here otherwise?
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
Take it easy, lady.  There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.
I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
Yes.
But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.
If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him -- for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more -- Burke and Hare and Knox --
But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
He has his own idea of a joke. Perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs.
I've just been to see Mrs. Marsh. Georgina is doing splendidly.  The incision has healed -- clean and fine -- but she doesn't seem to have any desire to walk.
Glencorse -- that's a lonely cemetery, Fettes, not a soul around for miles.
Hold that lamp up -- I must see her face.
But you'll have to stand great pain, Georgina.  Greater pain than you ever dreamed of in the worst time of your sickness.  Do you want it that much?
I am the best man for the job.
I'm not concerned about the child, Toddy.  It's you I'm thinking of, I'd like to see you prove that a lot of things I know haven't hurt Toddy MacFarlane any.
No.
I am a doctor. I teach medicine.
Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.
I take no gifts from you.
Get out of here!
But then I wouldn't have the fun of having you come here and beg again, Toddy.
What did you hear?
We could do that. But when he had them there, then what?
Perhaps -- a delicate operation -- an operation which has never been performed -- but it could be performed.  I'm sure it could be -- I could incise the columna dorsi --
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
He must leave me alone.
See, I heard you were looking for some guy with a scar. How's that going? You find him? Yes? No?
Bullshit. You're a killer, that's all you are. A clown with a bird and a rising death toll. You think the world did you wrong?! You did the world wrong.
There's no scar, you freak. The Corvis kid made it up.
There's no scar. Corvis made it up.
They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
Good thing in a situation like this.
No...
Yes I do, I really do.
It's what Lauren would do.
It's not. I can't take it.
You know.
Christ. It was Corvis. Tommy Leonard was right.
Sign of the dead come back to life.
You two are majorly demented. Anyone ever tell you that?
I mean Lauren.
Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message.
It's not what you think.
You killed her!
Stay away from me! Stay away!
About you.
What do you mean, dear?
No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you... I saw it!
No -- I'm afraid not.
I was speaking of earth men. I meant the greatest philosopher -- the greatest thinker.
Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.
Well -- there are several ways to reduce landing speed. You see, the velocity--
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to know about anything.
We went to the movies -- and we had ice cream cones -- and we went to see Daddy--
Goodnight.
Just Klaatu.
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.
I was only hoping to make you understand.
Apparently I'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are.
Under the circumstances I'm afraid that will be impossible.
There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
What about him?
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
Are you crazy? After what happened today?
But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
Why not? Somebody's got to get rid of him.
Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions. Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon, but he wasn't in. Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind.
You see -- the electricity's been neutralized -- all over the world.
This technique, in certain cases, can re-stimulate life for a limited period. It's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people.
I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?
But I suppose you know the answer.
He's my brother.
We don't ride with vampires.
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
Whattaya mean?
That is very probable.  What's your reasoning?
There's a cop behind us.
I don't want names!  Just lead me to him.  Where's their nest?
Sam, don't --
It's called the Indian walk. Walkin' without makin' a sound.
You have a T.V.?
Great.  I wanna get some new comics.
No.  Just you.
Oh, no, you won't.
I'm tired now.
Wait a minute, kiddo.
Ocean air!
I guess no one cares what I got a job.
We can't talk about it on the phone.
Lucy.
Okay, Sam.  Thanks.
If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
Don't be a baby.  That didn't hurt and you know it.
Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
I'm weak... Soon I'll need to feed.
Take laddie.
I'm so excited I just can't hide it.  I'm about to lode control and I think I like it.
Wanna go to the comic book store?
Nanook...
Sure.  You think there's a connection?
... You think this Thing wants to become an animal?  Dogs can't make it 1000 miles to the sea.  No skua gulls to imitate this time of year... No penguins this far inland... Don't you understand?!  It wanted to become us!
Fuchs...?  No, it's not Fuchs... You must let me back in... I won't harm anyone... I promise...
If it did get to him.
He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
That's impossible, man!  Okay, Clark, out of the john where I can see you!
Clark, you come on out here!!
He's gone already!  Do it!
Cut the bullshit... Okay, Sanchez, you come with us.  Norris... you stay here...  Any of them move -- you fry 'em. And if you hear anything, anything at all you let loose the siren.  We all meet back here in twenty minutes regardless.  And everybody watch whoever you're with.  Real close.
What for?
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
After all this mess then.
What's that?
You reach anybody yet?
Well, stick with it.  I want you at it round the clock.  We got to get help in here...
Little over two hours.
Move it, Palmer.
We going to make it?
Hope so.  Another ten, fifteen minutes.  What I don't get is...
Can you think of any other tests?
What are you going to do?  Drink it?
You know damn well what we both make of it.
Well, let's get down there.
He came back screaming... He never talked about it after that.  I don't think he even got this far.
But there's nothing here.
I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
Oh yes... They found our knowledge useful for a time.  They used us much as your people did.  Then they decided they had learned enough so they tore us up for spare parts.
You'll live like this forever. Alone.  You were meant to help.  To be with people.  Not like this.
Send him away.
No...
I won't leave you like this.
I'll never forget this.
Created?
They survived above.  Became what they are.
It can't all be like this...
When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
How do you keep the water temperature stable?
No -- wait -- the moon's falling out of orbit -- that's not possible!
Dance with me...
What?
I need to... um... talk to you.
Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
And what do you propose, Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
Darling.
Shhh.  Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right?
I want to get into the light, that's all.  Please...
I've seen it.
Tonight's the night?
You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
But shouldn't it be better? Shouldn't we be teaching our students to imagine a world beyond all this?
That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
But you won't listen.  You won't see me, you won't see anyone.  What would you like me to tell Jamie? That Uncle Alex is busy?  That Uncle Alex is hiding up there in his laboratory --
It wasn't your fault, Alex.
Do you find her?
I can't leave when I'm so close.
I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
Mm.
He's gone to a better place.
You're not from beyond the valley.
Then you can speak slowly.
How long ago?
Yes.  Or forward into the future. I suppose I really should check on the machine, see that it hasn't been damaged...
We share everything.
What you need is an engineer.  If you set up a system of pulleys and counterweights, some basic block and tackle mechanism, you could to this a lot more easily.
Most things.  We're very high on purpose.
What are you?
You liked it there.
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
You lost someone.
Is it?
Please, I beg you.  Take him away from here --
I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
Exactly correct, sir.
Do they?
Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?
Of course.  You're just tired. Mara, will you look after Alexander tonight?
We don't know.
You know that's not true.
[Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you...
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
[Uncertainly] In that thing...the Jacket.
I don't give a shit about your patient!
That's too bad.
It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?
The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.
You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker.
I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.
That's too bad.
I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
Maybe it's not such a waste.
[Beat] What do you need me to do?
And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.
No, it hasn't.
Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you.
Unfortunately, I'm not familiar with Dr. Becker and Dr. Gries passed away three, four years ago.
Mom, he just fixed our car.
Why?
Yeah.
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
No, it's not. [Beat] It's December 25th, 2004.
Yeah.
What?
I don't know how you got the cut to your head, but you died bleeding from it.
I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...
I know.
Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
I guess I'd ask you why.
You're not crazy.
I never knew my father. Did you?
Why would we do that?
No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from.
Maybe.
So what am I supposed to do?
Sure.
I don't think so.
Why "of course"?
[Beat] Real is overrated.
That when you stopped being a nurse?
No you won't.  You'll be back today. Now!  You get your ass back here, Thelma, now, Goddamnit.  Thelma, do you understand me?
In the leg.
Well, you're not exactly an expert witness, but what makes you so sure?
If waitin' tables in a bar don't make you an expert on human nature, then nothin' will, and I could've told you that Harlan Puckett would end up buyin' it in a parkin' lot. I'm just surprised it didn't happen before now.
You girls are in some hot water.
You want to come on in?
Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.
Oh, definitely.
Darryl, that's my husband, he says he's not ready.  He's still too much of a kid himself.  He prides himself on being infantile.
She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend.
I'm just some guy.  A guy whose parole officer is probably having a shit fit right about now.
Well, not anymore, Thelma, except for bustin' parole, I haven't done one wrong thing.
What did ya do?
Tell me.
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
Who's your friend?
Can't it go to any office?
What?
Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
Jimmy... it's beautiful!
Okay.  I will, too.
Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
How come he let you go?
'Cause I didn't ask him.
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
Get the car.
All of it.  That he tried to rape me.
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
Give me the keys.
Will I be?
I don't know.  I won't be.
You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way.
I know, Louise, but we're running for our lives!  Don't you think you could make an exception just this once?!  I mean, look at the map. The only thing between Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas!
No we shouldn't, but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime!
Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!
But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away!
You told that thievin' little shit where we were goin'?!
Now what what?
You know those little dogs you see people with?
Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos.
I can see that.
Just ignore him.
Just the look on his face when you...  ... it's not funny.
Now, Thelma, that is not...
Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
You do?
Yeah, you want it?
Yeah.
What'd I say again?
That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass.
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any deals.
Eeuww.
Well, let me know when you figure it out.
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
Pass him!
Does that mean suck my dick?
How long do you think that'll take?
What?!  What d'you think?!
Yeah.  I been seein' you, too.
Fuck that.
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.
No, I just meant...
You sent that?
Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.
What's he like?
Loser? You?
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
Why not?
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
I am?
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
Got cash.
You stole her from me. Now I want her back.
Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.
Bet your ass you are. Now I don't want to hear anymore of your happy horseshit. You gotta learn how to bend a little or believe me... you're gonna break.
Who the fuck is it to you?
Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about.
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
Some buildings I'm working on.
You know...  ...the guys who ride the short bus.
Isn't that a little politically incorrect?
The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with.
That sounds like fun.
Wow, I've never seen him like this. He doesn't usually like guys.
Great.
The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker is going to be here. He's an architect, too. You guys will have tons to talk about.
Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running around on the rug all day -- just makes for a lot of lint. Look at this...
Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
Huh... that's strange.
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then.
Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.
Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.
Well she must've packed on a few pounds over the years.
So she's married?
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
That's right -- if you weren't you would've looked for her yourself!
But... but you knew people at Harvard.
Nice.
Fucking sickening.
Don't flatter yourself -- I was following her, I always do. How the hell you think I got rid of Mary's boyfriend Steve?
Oh come off it, Mare. What about what's-his-name... Steverino? You could've at least passed the baton on that one.
Ah, she's okay.
You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
Fuck kindred spirits. My little Puffy here's gonna tell you all you need to know about this guy in about two seconds flat. If he starts yapping, he's a loser; if Puffy's relaxed... well, you got yourself a keeper.
The little shit lied to me about that guy!
Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
No no no, Tucker, thank you.
I appreciate you looking out for me.
Thanks, but I've got to be going. Unfortunately, Doc, this isn't a social visit.
Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this, but I'm really strapped for time here and --
Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.
Really? I never got a message.
Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years.  Don't make me wait another day.
Hi, Ted.
Hm?
I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
Jeez, Mary... I'm...
I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat.
I agree there should be more.
We've got a lot in common.
We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
Why not?
Okay.
But I think I'd be happiest... with you.
Really.
Prom? You're about twenty minutes late. She just left for the prom with her boyfriend Woogie.
Teddy, be brave.
Yeah, I'll bet you all were. Come on, in the truck.
Eh.
And I will only issue such instructions when ordered to by the President.  John Paul Jones... you don't understand a thing, do you, Admiral?
We can't worry about everything right now. We've got to figure out what we're going to do before we worry about how we do it.
They're going to be pressing for a military solution soon. We can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats. We need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here.
So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.
Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else.
Smoke.
I just checked myself.  They're being issued identity cards. Call comes, and evacuation officers meet them at pre-arranged departure areas. They go by helicopter to Mount Weather. We meet them there.
All right. Then I guess it's time.
I'll be evacuated with the President.
I want an hour with him.
This is about Cuba.
Not as far as the election goes.
All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows...
Fair enough. But Castro's on alert and we're flying attack planes over their sites, on the deck. There's no way for them to know they're carrying cameras, not bombs. They're going to be shot at, plain and simple.
Oh, just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our Jupiter missiles in Turkey if the Soviets'll do the same in Cuba.
If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world opinion.
Then somebody'd better deny it publicly.
Zorin must not have gotten instructions. Somebody in their Foreign Ministry's blown it big-time.
Just a second, Mr. President.
Don't get too attached.
Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land.
Oh, I'm set, Sir. I'm set.
Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here.
That's right. What are you doing here? This is a religious ceremony you're desecrating.
Different culture. Hard to penetrate. The Indians don't like white cops poking around. And that's why we're in a position where we have to bring in an American Indian agent.
I think maybe you guys got off the wrong exit, yeah? This is the Bear Creek Indian Reservation.
Check him out, Ray.
Jesus, I don't know. You tell me. You're the Indian.
I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
Yes.
-- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
Easy. Easy... I'm goin'.
He knows me?
He said he doesn't know.
He just did the Gettysburg Address in Sioux. What did he say?
Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
What are you talking about?
Sorry.
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry.
He hasn't left this place in twenty years. They got him.
We're going for The Stronghold.
Some Indian time?
If you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little... we'll be here.
You forced an innocent man to run like an animal. You've tried to poison my people's hearts against me with your manipulation, with letters I never wrote... you've been watching me eat, work, raise my family... wash myself in the river. And now you're here, arresting me at a sacred place.  In your eyes, that's power.
Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it down.
Yellow Bird committed suicide at three o'clock this morning. Some gung-ho agent from D.C. pushed him into a corner. You're playing a losing game. Pull over.
Mister Tully.
Do you want a coffee?
No, that was Leavenworth. This --  was Sioux Falls. What ya want?
Red Deer Table! What's with you, man?
Yeow!
For what?
You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.
Anything.
Okay, anything. Just...go. I've gotta work.
You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs?    Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die.
All you've got is one life. I guess it's worth about the same to every body. You ever see an old woman after her husband has died? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead...  When you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. That's your whole future. That's as far as it goes. But imagine what those seconds are worth.
I don't know yet.
Anything.
Why?
. Yeah!
It's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play.
How does it go?
You say the truth.  Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha?
Take something off.
Your watch.
F-14's sir.
Tomcats?
EVERYBODY'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE. ..NOW WE'RE RIGHT WITH YOU. YOU ARE INVERTED.  ROLL IT, COUGAR.
YEAH, COUGAR?
Lordy!  Eyeball to Asshole. Hope nobody burps!
This is crazy!
Roger, I've got it.
Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!
On what?
Who's your pilot?
Gotta keep track of the competition.
Just once, if they take your plane away.
Nothing. Let's just go fight.
Where do you find the time? Where do you find the energy. It's tough enough to keep your mind on school. A woman here is a real pain in the...
No shit! That why they call him Ice?
Come on. I died enough for one night.
IT'S MY SHOT.
YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN. I'M IN.
NO, NO, NO, HE'S MINE.
LOOK OUT!
And you were with Cougar. He was my roommate in flight school.
It's only been a week. Keep sending him up.
Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.  We're gonna get them wet unless we find a Sonoco station.
The rules of engagement are not flexible. They exist for your safety. You will obey them. Is that clear?
Or....
I didn't say that. That's up to you. But I have responsibility for the other guys up there, not just you. They need to know you're all right...that they can depend on you.
It's not true.
I didn't say that. That's up to you. I think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you'll be a better pilot... a better man.
Ah, shit.  You got me.  I ain't even married.  Now put your fucking hands in the air!
Don't take my word for it, Quaid. Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
Listen to me, Richter, I want Quaid delivered alive for re-implantation. Have you got that?  I want him back in place with Lori.
It's about goddamn time.
Hetero.
Any news of Quaid?
What, aliens?
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
He shoulda killed Quaid back on Mars.
Split up.  Find him.
Nobody.
Do what?
Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
I'm late.
I don't know!  It had something to do with Mars.
What did they do to you?  Tell me!
Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
I'm not your wife.
It was implanted by the Agency.
Implanted.
Doug, don't!
Right.  Mars.
What's in the two week package?
I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't know the difference.  Guaranteed, or your money back.
What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund?
Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.
Whatever you say...Just answer one question.  What is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken?
I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug. Just rest assured, by the time the trip is over, you get the girl, you kill the bad guys, and you save the entire planet.  Now you tell me.  Is that worth three hundred measly credits?
This is too weird.
Then he dumped me on Earth with a wife and a lousy job and ...
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm not falling for it.
He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
Kuato wants to see you.  Come on!
Just wondering.
I don't need Kuato for that.
You two-faced-bastard.
I'm not sure dear?  What do you think?
It's just up ahead.
We were buddies in the Agency back on Mars.  You asked me to find you if you disappeared.  So here I am, good-bye.
Yeah, well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way, right?
Right.  We're gonna run.  Get ready.
I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
I'd vote for outer space.  No way those are local boys.
You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
I keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and...
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
...And is dumber than my hind end. Like that Bobby Lynn Dexter...
Don't matter.  They're all the same: dead weight.  Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails.  Make my skin crawl!
Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
What the hell is going on?  I mean WHAT THE <u>HELL</u> IS GOING ON?!!
First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.
Right.  We need to be talking about what we're gonna do.
Jesus, Val, it's pretty far.
Not going to pole vault anywhere. That's for sure.
Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!
She just practically asked you for a date.  What the hell is wrong?!
Oh yeah?  Think about this:  She ain't as narrow-minded as you. I'll lay odds she's looking for character in a man.  For my part, I'd be proud to have her.  I'd goddamn worship her.
Forget it.  I got vegetables coming out my ears.  Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.
Yeah, Burt.  The way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive World War III.
Ah, but consider this, if we don't finish the roof, we can looks at that sky all the time.
God, what a stink!
Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
Yeah, well, I'm getting what I refer to scientifically as "weird vibes."  every sensor I've got is giving me strange readings.  I mean, the school has had these machines up here three years and they've never recorded anything like this.
Let's assume that it is.
He was your snitch.
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
Too fine, Badalato. The bad news is, you're gonna live.
It most certainly is.
Let go of my hair.
The testimony will remain in the record. Do you wish to cross-examine?
I had a minute before the Mapp hearing -- but I couldn't get you on the phone, Eddie...
I can see the hammer still, it was cocked...
Kim's prints were all over it -- He admitted it was his gun, f'r godsake!
-- Remember?
-- Listen: "November 5, 1980. Cecil Stipe walked into 5th Precinct. Says he witnessed Chin shooting, saw suspect's picture in Post. Says Shu Kai Kim wrong man."
"Cecil Stipe"? Have we seen any affadavit with that name?
What, the lunatic who --
So an upstanding member of the Aryan Warriors wouldn't paint them on. They take those teardrops seriously -- they're badges of courage, of honor. Only their most vicious killer elite get to wear them...!
I followed her from the courthouse.
Christ... Shu is innocent.
Everyone else was wrong and the one fucking lunatic was right!
I was never politically correct enough for Comrade Dowd.
EXACTLY!
It's okay, Eddie.
Let's not drag the Constitution into this.
Yes, but that's not the issue. What's on your wish list, Ed? Pleading Kim out to first degree man on both homicides, with an agreed sentence of 15 to life running concurrent? Come on... What're you looking for here?
Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer.
You're my only problem, Ed. What does it take to make you go away?
We reconvict, your man's looking at 25 years on two counts, served consecutively. So what I'd like to ask, Ed, is: Are you joking?
Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification.
Isn't it a standard trick to pack a line-up with men who resemble each other but look different than the suspect, so the suspect will stand out for the eyewitnesses?
-- Objection, your Honor! This case has no connection with any subsequent act my client may be charged with!
The great personal sacrifices endured by Mr. Reynard have no bearing on the legal issues, your Honor -- !
I'd need a continuance. Three weeks at least.
I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?
You mustn't talk to Art. You mustn't tell Art that I was at the trial. Do you hear me?
A Cubano army, basically... inside and outside prisons.
And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
Cigarettes, candy bars...  PCP, crack...
By "takes care of," you mean "kills".
Soldado.
Shu's the only one I know of...
Mr. Stipe. A young man named Jimmy Chin was shot to death eight years ago, in Chinatown. Do you remember talking to the police?
Telephone.  I suppose you don't know the phone company killed Kennedy because he was trying to b-break it up -- and they'll never let that happen. They control everything: what you say in the mouthpiece is never exactly what comes out the other end, and --
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
Well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here. I don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods. In fact, when the state boys called me about a "J. Edgar" coming up I think I said, "So what?"
Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
Did she have someone with her?
Yes they do. Did she have visitors?
ALBERT, COME BACK HERE. HE'S GONE CALL THE FRONT DESK.
Teresa Banks.
And neither will I.
Stanley, I heard all about it.
No.
No.
What do you mean?
We're heading into a difficult situation.
A blue rose.
Very good, but I can't tell you about that.
What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
No one could find those splinters without a machine like this. And no one had a machine like this.
She must have known someone.
I don't take it, Sam. I give it.
Noooo...
Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
Because Bobby is a loser, you said so yourself. He's a goon.  James is the one.  He loves you with that "lasting love"... "true love".
Sure. What do you want me to call you?
Come on, Laura. I'm your best friend.
Dancing.
You're not mad at me?
No.
What'll it be?
I did? I didn't see anything.
Yeah... look in here. Look at it from this angle.
But Bob isn't real.
The pages are gone. That's real.
Oh, yes... yes...
I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.
Why? It does.
It does matter. We're in love.
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
Right. Open your eyes, James. You don't know me. Even Donna doesn't know me. Your Laura disappeared... It's just me now.
Boating?
You're getting warmer.
Trees?
They were looking for wood.
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
Now hurry, dinner's almost ready. Your father says he's starving.
...school's fine...
No, you haven't met him. Have you met him?
We're late to get to your mother.
Yes.
No.
Laura didn't wash her hands before dinner.  And look at this.
I'm kind of busy, Norma.
You're right. There's no one here.
Norma, are you alright?
Abrams...
Good.  You ever been inside a hospital?
What did he find?
How good's your intelligence?
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
Yes.
Mickey told me to come back to work.
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie. When were you lying?
I...
No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...
Through, through his book.
How old are you?
...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
Answer affirmatively. Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't 'part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist. Isn't that right?
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
'Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
...to save her and to save the baby. Is that...
In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.
No. No. Thank you. You go home.
Why is that?
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
Negligent. Yes... it would have been criminal. But that was not the case.
That's perfectly all right. I'm kind of rushed. Do you mind if we walk while we talk?
Do you know who her doctors were?
...the case with anyone. And I'll meet you Tuesday, and we'll go over your testimony...
...that's perfectly all right.
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
Yes.
I did.
A single hour.
...things change.
I don't have a week. This case never should have come to trial. You know better. You're Mr. Independent. You want to be independent? Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
What?
A brick house says you divorced him. I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner. And I'll take your word for it. Now you tell me the truth. Because you cannot lie to me. What's your name?
No, no, I'm just...
And what makes you so tough?
What would you like it to be to me...? I, I, I can't invest in failure.
No... no...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
From the magazine?
How come you're calling me from...?
We find that your subscription lapsed...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
I don't want to leave her. Dick... the, the... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will...
That's for sure, Frank.
I know what I said but not now. You won it. Franky. You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won. We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine. Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.' Can you get out tomorrow? How come she isn't speaking up.
Right.
I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse?
I can't talk now.
D'you meet with Dr. Gruber...?
Gimme the address. I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
...one of the other nurses?
What happened in those three...
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.  Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
Let's go.
Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew.
Yes...ugly looking, isn't it.
Why, sure -- I got it!  Do you have a match?
I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.
Forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines.  They had him on the cover of 'Time'.  You've got to rate to get that!
I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now.
Where are we?
No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
I liked him.
But you're not going to.  You're not the kind.  You're tired, anyway.  You've been up all night.  You cracked up in a plane.  Slept in a ditch.  But you want to know something?  It doesn't show on you at all.
My kid brother has one.  You know why?
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
Right.
So is the town, I notice!
And they'll go out the minute there's another ray.  A cylinder reported down by Huntington Beach.  That's a job for the Navy.
Thank you, sir.  If they start anything, we can blast them right off the earth!
We sell the tamales, enchiladas - hot dogs!
Sure, sure!  Everybody understands you wave the white flag, you wanna be friends.
I thought he'd stopped doing horror.
And I...I've got other things happening.
I'm sure we can match any offer.
You've got to get back on the horse some time.  Look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.  I know how scary that feels.
Was there any trigger event?  A trauma, shock or...  You haven't shown him any of the films you make, have you?  The horror stuff?
Is he all right?
I like this story.
You've got to sleep, Dylan, you...
Coming for you...
When it is denial.  I don't think that's the case here, but if you're really worried, have a doctor check him out. You'll see, everything's fine.
What are you talking about?
Yes?
The car's no there yet?
Sure.  We'll do an operation, Doctor Dylan and Doctor Julie. We'll fix him good as new.
Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
Whether or not you're willing to play Nancy one last time.
Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line.  How are you?
Really!  Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time.  It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you.
No time like the present.  The car will bring you.
Now?
Sounds good.  Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee?  How you like it, Hon?
Yep.
You miss him.
Good.  Let's go sailing.
It's me, don't you see.  Terry's right, I'm the escape hatch.  I disobeyed order.
Okay.
Whatever.
Congratulations.
What?
What was that?
It was a bad dream...
I guess.
No, I didn't.
Fine.
I'm used to spending a lot of time alone.  I guess that's what I thought it would be out here.  But, it's not is it?
I'm sorry I left you hanging up there.
That's like wondering if your mom and dad do it.  Who wants to know?
Kennet Square, PA.  'Mushroom capital of the world'.
Who?
Jesus, you never told them?
Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
Of what?
It's his father sir.  He's suffocating him.  We've all seen it...
They send us because they want us to change, or grow up or something and then they try to keep us the same.
Happily, it all worked out... This time.  Bill, take Philip below and help him find a bunk.
And, of course, we are.
A padlock.
What's that?
She's Cuban.
Not a chance.  Remind them that according to the Geneva Convention, firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war.
I don't have to listen to this.
About anything.
But, they don't speak English.
There are some things that everybody does in the same language.
Each one of you will be responsible for one student.  I'll expect you to be courteous.  You represent this school and your country.  We'll sail in the morning.
They are much more than that, sir.
Isn't also true that his vessel went down off of Nantucket?  Lost everyone on board.  In fair weather no less.
May I ask you something?
Everybody knows why she went over Tod.  You jibed the boat.
How ya feelin', Artie? I heard you wasn't doin' too well recent.
This be it?
You know, I really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... Can you fuck like that?... You like it like a bunny?... Huh?... Cause baby, I'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack-rabbit bunny... Jump all around in that hole... Bobby Peru doesn't come up for air.
Am I scarin' ya?... Your pussy wet?... Come on... is it?...  Hey, don't jump back so slow... I thought you was a bunny... Bunny jump fast - you jump back slow... Mean somethin', don't it?... Means somethin' to me... Means you want Bobby Peru... You want Bobby Peru to fuck you hard baby - open you up like a Christmas present.
No.
Be easy, Sailor. There's two employees. I take one in the back to open the safe, you keep the other'n covered... You ain't plannin' on raisin' a fam'ly in Big Tuna, are ya?
Just took a guess is all... You in or out on this deal?
She's my girl... She's drivin'... That bother you?
Why should it?
Everythin's relative. Where's that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didn't split up, I hope.
Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me somebody lookin' like her was at the Nothin' Fancy yesterday.
What happened on the charges?
Don't fuck with me, man. You look like a clown in that stupid jacket.
In many capacities.
How's that?
Now, Marietta, I am goin' to help you. And don't be gettin' carried away. You don't want to be bringin' Santos and his people into it.
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
Sailor ain't a murderer. You got to get off that kick. And far's I can tell, Sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin' Lula. Even there he was protectin' her. You oughta be thankin' him for that. That Bob Ray Lemon they say was comin' after the both of 'em. Why am I tellin' you this, you was around that night. You ought to know just exactly what happened. Sailor just got a little too forceful is all... You remember that night...
Marietta, settle down now darlin'... I want what's best for her, too - like I said, I'll do what I can to bring her home.
Listen, Johnnie, Lula just called me. She knew you were in N.O., so they left the city.
Marietta, I was just gonna leave and see if I could pick up their trail.
See ya downstairs.
Why, Pace Roscoe Ripley, ain't you got one cute mouth tonight?
Course he ain't never killed nobody. Why'd you say that, Pace?
Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all. Don't need to make more'n it was.  This couple's goin' on a date to Hawaii. The girl chose him over the other two guys.
Don't the reject guys get anythin'?
Yeah?
At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know? Gettin' out? And what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again.
It ain't so funny now, though. December before Christmas? Dell disappeared again and Aunt Rootie hired a private eye to find him. He was missin' for almost a month before he wandered back in the house on mornin' dressed in some filthy Santa Claus suit.
There's worse things that can happen to a man, honey.
I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would.
Those toenails dry yet? We got some dancin' to do.
Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez. At that age you still got a lot of energy.
You're excitin' me, honey. What'd she do?
Poor baby. She don't know what she missed. What color hair she have?
They sure do stink.
What's that, peanut?
Too bad they don't give an award for talkin'... You'd win first prize. Especially with those tits.
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
Who knows, baby?
You notice that woman when we come in? The white woman sittin' by herself?
Told you not to call your mama.
You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
That'd be good, Lula.
You know, Lula, I never told you what all I was doin' before I met you.
How'd you know my daddy?
If you say so.
I don't know... Looks like clothes.
We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.
That was in Vietnam.
He ain't never known me, Lula, so there ain't much for him to forget. Not seein' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too.
SAILOR!!!!
In international news, India plans to release crocodiles in the Ganges, the holy Hindu river in which millions of people bathe annually, to scavenge for corpses, authorities said.
HOLY SHIT!! IT'S THE NIGHT OF THE LIVIN' FUCKIN' DEAD!!!!
Like hell.
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
How would I do that? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii?
Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?
That's your business... I don't care how.
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
On one condition...
One day he's gonna find out what we're up to with Mr. Reindeer, and he could cause us a lot of trouble.
Santos... You kill that Sailor, otherwise he's gonna turn my baby against me.
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
Sure... I figured I'd see you sometime...
Is there a contract?... We made a deal once that we'd tip each other off if we ever heard.
Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens.
Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it?
The candelabras were my Gran's.
Isn't she?
Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it sometime this weekend. Think that might be possible?
She left me. Crabs.
Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis... Curtis Hardapple.
Because... because...
Back up. Go out the other way.
Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives.
Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
Which is?
What's to tell?
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
He said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his.
He was never able to reproduce them.
Oh, right. Oola. About that jacket...
That's very enlightened, Professor. It's comforting to know that America's children have you for a teacher.
This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving this car?
Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun.
As long as it looks like her, I don't care. You know what I'm saying?
With Emily?
It used to shoot these little paper caps, but they don't make them anymore. The caps.
You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?
It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write.
Right.
Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.
That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
Right. That's why you were standing in the Chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap gun of yours tonight. You're fine, all right, you're fit as a fucking fiddle.
Mmrrmmm... KNAP SAP!
That's a big book you're writing.
But... ?
Ah. I don't believe in writer's block.
And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
There is, but it's not that interesting.
It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.
Jesus, James. Wow.
Where's that?
You're mad at me, aren't you?
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
The hell I am.
I never said that.
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
I think so... What about you?
The answer's yes. I think. Yes. I don't know. Where are they exactly?
I would if I knew where I was taking him.
I don't think it really matters, Hannah. We could probably stand him up in the garage with the snow shovels at this point.
Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to... to your book.
Uh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as shocking as this may sound, I'm not the first writer to sip a little weed. And furthermore, it might interest you to know that one book I wrote, as you say, 'under the influence,' happened to win a little something called the PEN award which, by the way, I accepted 'under the influence.'
Chancellor.
I got the message you called too.
Simple.
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
What's he doing out there?
I'm sort of helping him work through some issues.
It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
I lost it all.
It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.
GRADY Tripp. English Department.
Sara. I'm in love with her.
Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley together.
No, the dog.
That's all right. We'll find him.
You want to keep him happy.
Got a job at old Frank's place. His son runs it now.
Yeah, you still with Northland?
You find me a decent place for under three hundred a month in this town, and I'll happily move out of this crap neighborhood.
Annette? She's good... tense.
I don't know. She won't talk about it.
She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.
Then what? What?!
I made that table for you and Annette, for your wedding. I put a lot of love into it.
No thanks.
Next week? The week after?
Early July.
The important thing is that you and Annette need to talk. She needs to see you, and you need to see her.
I'm just talking, man.
Well... not in the common way.
Have a seat.
Unusual design for a contemporary piece.
You can't talk to me like --
You going to take me on a nature walk?
No.
No.
A man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that?
You said last night. I went to bed pretty early.
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
Yes.
Do you have many friends?
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
Ms. Kramer.
I know because... it's just something I know.
Do I take "okay" to mean you feel good about working there?
No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
I don't understand.
Ev-i-dence.
You think reflection is good.
I wish you'd give it a try.
It's okay.
Honest? No.
Forget it.
I don't feel anything.
I'm not afraid. I'm just saying that Carlos has a thing for his daughter, and if he isn't careful he's going to suffer.
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here?
How do you define it?
What is your idea of being a Jew?
Whatever my ideas are of being a Jew is not going to help you.  Why don't we continue this on Thursday.
I don't know.
Nothing. Can I open my eyes?
In your mind, Walter. Take your time.
Where?
A nap?
Time.
I'm all right.
People without cars.
No weirder than a sharp, young, good- looking woman working in a lumberyard.
Neither do you.
What do you think?
I get that impression.
No you're not.
Well, Walter, this is going to sound off-the-wall, but I like to sleep with a man after we fuck.
The judge had a thing about sex offenders. Later I heard his daughter had been raped. If I hadn't had a good lawyer, it would have been twenty- five to thirty.
I'm sorry, Walter.
The percentages --
Which brother did this?
I love all of them. They're strong, gentle men with families of their own. And if you asked them about what they did to me, they'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you.
Where're you?
It was alright for a while, you know.  But then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago.
No way that could just be seawater.
Kirkhill?  That guy doesn't know his butt from a rathole.  Hey, Perry!
Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig.
No!  I'm okay now.  I just don't... I can't go any further in.
Wasn't up to me.
No.
Whose then?  Lindsey?  Talk to me...
Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker.
Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--
Who's hysterical?  Nobody's hysterical!
Bud, this is me, Lindsey.  Okay?  You know me better than anybody in the world.  Now watch my lips... I saw these things.  I touched one of them.  And it wasn't some clunky steel can like we would build... it glided.  It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
Chill out, Lindsey!!
It's trying to communicate.
Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
Everything is.
Why bring it here?
It's his mixture!  Too much oxygen!
Not us.  Not human.  Get it?  Something non- human, but intelligent...
Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook- up Coke.
Let's go for it.  We could get lucky.
Through three miles of water?   I don't know.
She'll wait.
No. It's not enough... I told you before that I would like to get away for a while and be alone.
But you just said that a month was too...
But how could you say such a thing?
As you wish.
Sounds like the name of a fish -- merluzzo, basiluzzo...
More so than the shark?
I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be that they're in love?
Yes, very much so.
For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I guess they aren't like that any more. My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly?
But it's so sad. So terribly sad. I'm not used to it, I'm not ready for it... You know... I have never been so upset in my life. Sandro, why don't you help me?
Who knows why they all left...
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
So, even if I did say them, I was sincere with her, as I am now with you.
I don't doubt it. But at a time like this we're the least suitable persons to be with him. And as far as telephoning him... Who knows where he is?
Good night. Tell me that you love me.
One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
But aren't you tired? I can just about manage to stand on my feet!  Raimondo!
I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being like that.
When one approaches fifty, my dear, he is affected only by the cold.
So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?
Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses, you'll need some rope and ladders...
Don't worry, we've got everything.
I don't see why I should mind.
You know, I don't love anybody.
I can't say.
She'd punish me.
Why does it matter whether you're fat or not...
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
I... I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I... I won't be able to fit in, I... I won't be able to squeeze into Heaven.
I don't know.
Yes Mother.
Yes, Mother.
Yes.
Who?
Oh, there are so many.
And you like that?
Would you like to talk about it?
I don't know.
Where did the baby come from?
Where'd it come from before that?
Agnes, how are babies born?
What do you mean?
Are you married?
Not at the moment, no.
Do you have any children?
Why not?
She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things.
What things?
Do you?
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
A mistake... it was a mistake...
Everything... I don't have children.
Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
You can tell me.
How?
Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.
As much as Mother Miriam does?
It came out of me.
Because I was afraid.
No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How did the baby get into you?
Yes.
Did anyone else know about the baby?
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
I hate them.
Who?
Do you know who put it there?
For me to get sick in.
Yes.
What do you do?
I have to throw up...
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Not your fault...
Agnes who did you see?
Why?
I don't believe this. I don't bloody believe this.
It's gone on long enough. You're out.
It's your favourite...
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
Marie's dead Mama.
You can call me Sister.
I can beat that.
She undressed alone... she bathed alone.
Who was the father?
Yes, but I...
I believe Agnes is different.
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
No... not in the eyes of the police.
And in your eyes?
No-one knew about Agnes' pregnancy. No-one. Not even Agnes.
And you weren't shocked?
She stopped eating completely...
She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand!  She could have bled to death.
Not simple, no.
I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud. 
What sheets?
The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was. I was needed in the sick room.
Oh God, if only I'd known.
Why didn't you?  You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.
Because I didn't know... 
Bullshit!
Oh, you've come a long way baby.
There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
Do you think they ever existed?
No.
For Agnes.
Who is he?
That's crazy. How could she find out about it?
Somebody told her.
I'm concerned about her health.
Who was that person Mother?  Was it you?
You wanted that child out of the way.
No!
Wasn't it!
Eh?
Oh don't be so stroppy!
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
Yeah, I've blown school out.
Just you?
Oh, it's all right.
How about Ding Dong?
I'm a deserter, too.
Oh.
Read 'em!
No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
Oh, my God, he's a natural.
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
Grotty?
You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
I don't care.
It is, y'know.
You crawler.
Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.
Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.
Follow your impulse.
You're getting out of hand. I don't know what's come over you today.
Oh, sorry I spoke.
Is it ... is it, really?
Thank you.
Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?
The big hammer?
But the way you did it then sounded so phony.
Well, you've got to have people to taste your treacle toffee.
Oh, definitely, it sticks out a mile, she's trying to get him to marry her but he doesn't want ... well ... I don't reckon any fella's ever wanted to get married. But girls are like that, clever and cunning. You've got to laugh.
And cunning.
Aye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. Anyroad, I'd better get back.
Do you think I haven't noticed ... do you think I wasn't aware of the drift? Oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff, they've driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature.
Yeah ... what's in it for me?
I'm not wrong.
That's what they want you to think. All coppers are villains.
Lip reading.
I'll look after meself.
Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!
Who are these ruffians?... I've never seen them before in my life! ... 
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
And I take a left-handed view of life, I've got to.
Oh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke.
No ... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it'ud give him a change of scenery, like.
Y'what?
Hello the income tax have caught up with us at last.
We were going to do it.
You're a swine. So hurry up ... we're travelling!
No, I'm not.
I'm not, no.
Oh you do, look.
Oh yes.
I would have said so.
Your Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.
You've lost him.
Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.
Someone put it on me.
But...
That's too easy for Lennon.
I know, that's the trouble.
Oh, anything you say, Paul.
I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
I feel like shit...
Hell, no!  We don't know what's down there on that piece of rock!  It might be dangerous!  What we should do is get on the radio to the exploration authorities... and let them deal with it.
Do you remember the pyramid?
There are no commercial lanes out here.  Face it, we're out of range.
What's up?
A transmission?
Has the hull been breached?
Well, get started.
Why, what's wrong?
You know what they make this stuff out of?
We have to avoid injuring it.  What we really need is some electric animal prods.
Machine's screwed up, I can't tell. Needle's spinning all over the dial.
Damn it!  How long to fix?
And when will you be ready to do that?
Right.
Right. 
We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it.  At least right now it's keeping him alive.
What do you mean?
Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid?  It's dead.
Maybe we can catch it.
How's Broussard?
How do we locate the creature?
Let me go first; you stay behind me.
I've completely lost their signal.
I'm trying.
What is it -- I can't tell anything --
The same thing must've happened to the creatures on the other ship... except they took one of those jars on board, and opened it there.
Listen, hadn't somebody better check on Broussard?
And the creature with it.  We can make it back to Irth in the lifeboat.
We can use the flamethrower.
Hey look, somebody has to have his hands free to lock the creature in the lifeboat!
Thanks for the thought. 
We should be almost on top of it.  I just can't quite...
Who knows?
Let's let the machine work on him.
Yes, thank heaven.
We're just plain lucky.  That could have gone right through the hull -- taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it.
Room by room, corridor by corridor.
We'll have to trap it somehow.  If we had a really strong piece of net, we could bag it.
Time and space have no meaning out here.  We're living in Einsteinian equation.
I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.  Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen.
They're on the next level up.
Okay.
Couldn't the pyramid have been built here by space travellers?
Right.  Fire up all systems.
Well, it's finally happened.
Well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them...
Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!
Good.
He went into the pyramid alone.  We lost radio contact with him.  When we pulled him out, it was on his face. It won't come off, not without injuring him.
They seem native to the planet.  It's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity.  It's dead now, but once it must have been fertile.
Quit complaining; we're in space.
All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time.
Yeah... I forgot.
Now.  If we can get it into the boat, we won't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space.
Look...
No... don't...
God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.
Nah.  I just wanna squeeze off a few rounds.  'Sides, they tagged the rhinos for the migration project, so they're protected.  They'll dock you a month's pay for just mentioning it.
A three-second burn to port, on my mark.
What?  What's wrong?  What is it?
Yesterday.  We got the Network feed from Gateway; it was the top story on 'Sixty Seconds'.  Biggest market crash since twenty-four.
No, but I got something that might interest you.
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts.
One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this.
Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
It's moving slow.  About... eleven metres. On the left.
Is it still moving?
Couple more seconds!
Which mean physically going outside.
What's the problem?
Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
Right.  Auto-shop, you all set?
We haven't used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module. That was four months ago.  I can't ask for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is.
Didn't feel like whoopin' it up with the rest of us blue collars, huh?
Four.
Six month stint on Datus.
Ah, don't worry about I.C.C.  They're the least of your problems right now.
Again?  How long before we start noticing the difference?
Alright.  Pull some trackers and headsets out of stores, and I'll sign a release for the weapons.  Cassie, organise a team roster and put it on the board.
What can I do?
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
Give me a yell is something happens.
Please do.
And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?
Heart to heart? Woman to woman? Including a casual reference to the part of "Cora" - and your hopes of playing it.
It wasn't meant to be.
Just like it.
And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality...
You know me better than that.
She's always been so fantastically devoted to Lloyd. I would imagine that only death or destruction could keep her-
I didn't mean just the Theater.
- and artistically, the most promising! Eve dear, this is Addison.
We decided the night before last, before we came up here...
What do you mean by that?
No-no-no...
You can have one at Max's.
You're being childish.
Very well. I shall drop you and go on to the party. I have no intention of missing it...
I don't want to make trouble. All I want is a drink.
That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.
I was there. An eyewitness.
You were there? At the play - last night?
She may be later than you think...
It just slipped your mind.
A mass of music and fire. That's me. An old kazoo and some sparkles. Tell me - was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice?
I'm a junk yard.
Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
You're my girl, aren't you?
That I am...
Bill, you know how much I do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff...
Sure! Like the Western Union boys used to do...
I love you too. Good night, darling-
I thought you were going to be late-
Thirty minutes, forty minutes! What of it?
Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...
You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.
Here we go...
The playwright doesn't make the performance - and it doesn't just happen! And this one didn't - full of fire and music and whatnot, it was carefully rehearsed I have no doubt, over and over, full of those Bill Sampson touches!
Tell that to Dr. Freud! Along with the rest of it...
Well, I am.
I wish it were.
He does not exaggerate. I was good.
I want everybody to shut up about Eve. Just shut up about Eve, that's all I want. Give Karen more wine...  ... never have I been so happy. Isn't this a lovely room? The Cub Room. What a lovely, clever name. Where the elite meet. Never have I seen so much elite - and all with their eyes on me. Waiting for me to crack that little gnome over the noggin with a bottle. But not tonight. Even Eve. I forgive Eve... there they go.
I'm going to have a home. Not just a house I'm afraid to stay in... and a man to go with it. I'll look up at six o'clock - and there he'll be... remember, Karen?
So few come back...
You didn't have to tell me.
Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.
No thanks, Birdie.
But she just got here...
Well. I guess a real tight girdle help when you're playin' a lunatic.
Miss Coonan...
If I haven't, I'll find something till you're normal.
You don't have to apologize for me!  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'...
She's got two things to do - carry clothes an' press 'em wrong - an' just let anybody else muscle in...
You don't like Eve, do you?
An answer.
How do you mean that?
You were just looking around...
Lots of actresses come from Brooklyn. Barbara Stanwyck, Susan Hayward - of course, they're just movie stars.
With changing and everything, a little over an hour.
You rest. I'll get it...
Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.
He'll agree with you. Tell me, what do you between the time Margo goes in and comes out? Just huddle in that doorway and wait?
Not just that way. As a friend...
Karen.
Do you think Miss Channing would approve?
But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-
You won't forget it?
I won't forget.
Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
Nothing definite yet - it's just to have lunch.
Can't we sit down? Just for a minute...
Oh, but there is-
In a way. You find yourself trying to say what you mean, but somehow the words change - and they become his words - and suddenly you're not saying what you mean, but what he means-
Something most important you can do.
"Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
But not all of it - not that Lloyd and I are going to be married.
How do you do, Mr. Richards.
I'd like anything Miss Channing played...
There are other plays...
The four of you must have so much to say to each other - with Mr. Sampson leaving...
You certainly can. Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning...
I mean the performance. Except for you, you'd think he'd never even directed it - it's disgraceful the way they change everything around...
Very becoming. It looks better on you than it did on me.
I can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself?
Well, if you'd been here to begin with, I wouldn't have dared to read at all...
What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...
Autograph fiends! They're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes-
They're nobody's fans! They're juvenile delinquents, mental detectives, they're nobody's audience, they never see a play or a movie, even - they're never indoors long enough!
I'm so happy you're happy.
Of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet-
Roughly ten minutes.
How far to the station?
Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
We've all seemed a little tense lately...
I can't believe Eve said those things!
And again and again! Two hours late for the audition, to begin with-
- everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about... until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing...
Well. We've spent weekends before with nobody talking...  ... just be sure to lock up all blunt instruments and throwable objects...
Just a little skid, that's all. This road's like glass.
I guess I didn't look. You know I don't pay attention to those things...
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
That's quite a change of subject.
I'm trying hard to follow you.
It strikes me that Eve's disloyalty and ingratitude must be contagious!
That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!
Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.
Such as?
You - for one. I told her you were set on Margo playing the part - and I certainly wouldn't make a change without your approval.
Where is she?
The play? All right, I guess...
How do you mean?
I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
Well. I don't want to play "Cora."
But what could she do?
She'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure-
Are you breaking the contract?
--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
--it was bullshit the way it was--
I was sure trying.
--see?--
You're not a kid anymore.
Facts or theory?
We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked.
I just wish we knew when someone would talk to us, that's all.
When?
Segovia begged me for me secret but I said, "No, Andres, you'll have to try and make it without me."
You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
Haldeman.
--jeeeeeeesus--
The rest is Barker's bank records. It's mostly the eighty-nine thousand in Mexican cashier's checks--
Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating Kennedy--
Sure. I remember seeing a book about Chappaquiddick on his desk and he was always getting material out of the White House Library and the Library of Congress and--
That's right.
During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls.
It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the OK from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the OK from the President.
Can't help you.
--yes--
And?--
--goddamnit, when's somebody gonna go on the record on this story--
--it makes the break-in real--it's a major goddamn story--  --I'm not going to kick ass over this, but I'd like you to know I hate getting beat, I just hate it-- don't forget that I hate it--
This girlfriend of mine at the Committee, the other day she went back to the D.A. to tell the things the FBI didn't ask her. That night, her boss, he knew what she'd done. They control everything; that's how they know it all.
FBI too?
You don't believe me? Well, I was working the weekend of the break-in and my God, all the executives were running around like crazy--you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine--and when the FBI came to investigate, they never even asked me about it.
We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.
It's obvious you want to talk to someone--well, I'm someone.
I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.
The ones who could disburse the money.
Who were they?
So tell me about the Times article.
No games, Irwin; give.
We were never told flat out "Don't talk." But the message was clear.
Is he on the level of Assistant to the President or not?
--what do you think?--
--you have nothing more to say, I understand that.
Well, they never would have been assigned if anyone had known the burglars had arranged for their own counsel. And that could only mean the burglars didn't arrange for their own counsel--they never even made a phone call.  So if they didn't ask for you to be here, how did you know to come?
That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in.  You come up with anything?
--melodramatic?  Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City.
Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines.
Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti.
And Justice and FBI know all this?
--you've done worse than let Haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him--I didn't think that was possible. A conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck. You build from the outer edges and you go step by step. If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure. You've put the investigation back months.
--yes, yes, what is it?
Will you step forward, sir. 
Government. Recently retired.
Nobody ever had too much.
--quit equivocating, say what you mean--  --our story got Government Accounting to start an audit on CREEP's finances--
Then how come the Associated Press were the ones found out that Mr. McCord is security coordinator for the Committee to Re-elect the President, otherwise known as CREEP?
As a rough rule of thumb, as far as I can throw Bronco Nagurski, that's how much I trust John Mitchell...
I never asked them about Watergate. I only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty.
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
You're a killer, Ozzy!
Sorry, coach.
You need some work, buddy!
Like what?
Pardon me?
Yes ma'am, I am.
Neither did I!
Why is this?
You can call me Oz.
Come on!  I won't tell.
...okay.  Cool then.  I'm um, I'm glad you came by.  I mean, really.
So you're going to Michigan?
Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
...yeah.
It's gonna sound really bad, but I want you to know.
Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet.
That's not why we're going out.
...I've never tried it.
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.
Sorry, I thought you were dead.
Went home to shit.
Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
No, but come on guys, we made a pact!
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Yes.
Okay.  You want a story?  Here's a story.  Stifler finds this beer, right?  And...
Well, this one time?  At band camp? We were playing this game, I don't know if you know it?  But it's called spin the bottle?  And I had to kiss this guy named Marc Wander on the lips?  And...
Okay, I get it.
Don't you want me to?
Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land.
"Fun loving" -- insane.
Perhaps you can help me with my studies?
Do you mind?  This fabric is so uncomfortable.
No!  I've got...reserve reserves!
Kevin, this is serious!
Yes!  I'm a shithead!  I'm a complete and total shithead!
Yeah.
Like, normal style.  The...missionary position.
Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
Ready for what?
Uh...I thought you might know a trick or something.  To make her, you know...
You've just inherited The Bible.
Once, in church, dude.
It's early Springsteen, dude, this is classic.  This was before the cheesy remake.
Then where does a blowjob figure in?
I can't, I have no idea how he's doing it.  And that leaves you trailing, Jim.  You gotta get your act together.
Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?
Doing what?
Would you shut up?
You try to be a good sport, and look what happens.
It's all in the tongue. Another bottle?
A-duh... You're a werewolf. And we, as your victims, have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted.
Uh huh... And, supposing I believed that, what could I do about it?
Fine. My mistake. You know, I'm gonna be a writer myself some day.
In an underground club? I'd like to see that.
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
It's okay. I can see fine.
What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
Where?
Somewhere where there are no police, and plenty to eat.
After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
Right.
FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
"Fuck"? You think I don't know this word "fuck"? Is that how you talk to policemen in America?
Shit!
Sure. Don't you?
Oh no... no....
What?
Yeah, well if I claw my face off, just pack it in ice, okay? Jesus... the cops were probably right. My uncle was messed up with a bunch of fry brains and they went berserk on him.
Andy? Andy is that you?
Vegetable, right. My mistake. It seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. They fled into the tunnels beneath Paris, that's all we know...
Well, when you're about to pop off, what have you got to lose? Thanks for your help.
No we can't. That's the problem. God knows it would beat hanging around with you!
Yeah, I know. Back to the Eiffel Tower.  And what about you?
Right. Little twerp thinks he's Colombo.
What were you showing her?
Get on! Anastasia, get on!
I'm not sure but look. . .
Ah ... the Lady Sophie... The ravishing first cousin, once removed, from the Empress. We must convince Sophie that you are the Princess before we'll be granted a meeting with the Empress ... your grandmother, I mean.
You must have.
I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
Who are you?!
I wasn't bothering you. I was trying to wake you up!
Why?
It's the best fork of all
No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think...
Is it? Is this what you want?
No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached.  Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
Me? No. Rich food - it kills me. Ever try and fly after one of those heavy sauces?
Shut up!
She does.
And tell me that she's happy.
I did no such thing!
Oh, heavens, no... but ...  She is going to be at the Ballet Russe tonight! That's the Russian Ballet - Russe for Russian, oh those crazy French... they only go to see which dancers will defect.
You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?
You don't want my autograph.
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.
Tsch.
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
Hey, you... everybody in line at the New Yorker has to know our rate of intercourse?
Well, he's spitting on my neck! You know, he's spitting on my neck when he talks.
Stop it! Don't... don't do that! There.
Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
Me? Oh, downtown!
Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.
Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.
Wisconsin.
And I love what you're wearin'.
Hey, well, listen... hey, you wanna come upstairs and, uh... and have a glass of wine and something? Aw, no, I mean... I mean, you don't have to, you're probably late and everything else ...
M'hm...
Duane?
Oh, I see, I see.
You know, I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender-
'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
Well, uh...  You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.
I know.
think that's, uh-
Yeah!
Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right?
Oh, all right.
Okay. Yeah.
Oh, yeah?
Good? I was-
Here, you want some?
Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, I think. Big-
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah?
No, I'm not.
Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.
Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.
How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
Yes, it is.
What?  Hey, listen, what-what do you think? Do you think we should, uh, go to that-that party in Southampton tonight?
Oh, come, you don't need that.
Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
Following is different. I was spying.
It's his name.
Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
Whatta you mean? Me?
Tsch, what'd the doctor say?
Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?
Yeah, but you said, "Will it change my wife"!
It was just great!
Is he in the bathroom?
Oh, I-I left it at your house.
Oh, don't go, okay? Please.
Oh, uh, I don't know. I miss you. Tsch.
W-w-whatta you mean?
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.
That'd be fun for yuh. Don't you think-
Yeah.
Holy cow!
Yeah, but it's real close.
Try it... it'll add years to our sex life.
All right, all right, you don't wanna go to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do?
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
Oh, I'm sure it's a lot of fun, 'cause the Incas did it, you know, and-and they-they-they were a million laughs.
This "Denial of Death". You remember this?
Yeah, and I-I tru- you know, I trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her.
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
I'm late.
You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
Tell the folks where you are today, Donald.
Hey, you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now...  they're ahead two points.
There are people out there from The New Yorker magazine. My God! What would they think?
Don't get upset!
Well, I can't li- We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous. There's... You got crickets and it-it's quiet... there's no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, there's the screens with the dead moths behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and Terry-
Jesus!
Yeah.
He's screaming his opinions in my ear.
What are you depressed about?
Yes.
Mean?
Sure.  just don't-don't get angry, you know what I mean? 'Cause I-I have - I have my-my license here. You know, it's a rented car. And I've...
Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
Forget it, Max.
Don't you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.
You'll total the whole car.
Yeah, well, I used to lose my glasses a lot.
Yeah, well, that's why this machine is dynamite.
What difference does that make?
Visible panty line. Max, she is gorgeous.
How do you like this couple, Max?
If only I didn't feel guilty asking Annie to move out. It'd probably wreck her. But I should be honest.
You think so? Do you really?
Yeah.
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
I don't know. I don't know.
Uh, how did this personality come about?
Oh yes.
Would it make a difference?
And how's the diva doing?
No, what?
Not this time.
You're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about.  You won't care who's in your damn movie.
I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Well, I'm a little stressed.  And I've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby.
You know Sophia.  She's so damned judgemental.  And she's so damned... perfect.  And so fucking... serene.  Just fucking don't tell her.  Because you know Mac thinks she's God.  And I can feel him comparing.
Oh my God, the sitter.
Can I open it?
Oh, very jealous.
Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job.
Leave us alone right now.
Excuse me?
Hey!  Would you?
I worry because you don't.  It's my job. I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
Did you invite them?
The Roses?  And of course they said yes.
Beats a lawsuit.
Well, it might be Clair.  They're threatening not to come...
You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
I'll say as little as possible.
You can never be too early or too thin.
Panes is not on your team anymore.
It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door.  It was done.
What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.
I'm not sure we understand that word in the same way.
Love?
Sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit.  And second...
It's a shit novel anyway.
Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
Mac?  Mac says it?  Cal?
Everybody hates the messenger.
Okay.
Ah...
Oh, Sally Mae...
Oh, you know, I am.
Don't I find what?
Ours.
What?  Oh yeah, the camera man?  They gave me a list.
Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do.
I meant Sally.
No, he's absolutely right.  You're absolutely right, Ryan.  Dog talk must be banned.  Canine conversations are completely discouraged... it's really good of you to join us.  Can I get you a drink?
Elitism?
Here, drink this.  Drink lots of water.  Hold on to this.  Take deep breaths. Nice and slow.  Would you like a lolly?
Lemon it is.
You must have been a baby.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so happy you like it.  I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you.
Trust him.
Not good.
I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila.
I don't need a drug.
I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car!
Oh?
Do Peter Sellers again.
If he were still alive, maybe.
Are you lovesick?
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
We're just feeling our way back.
I'm worried about your Galiano.
Yes.  Fine.
That's it?  Yes.  Fine?
Panes is not on my team anymore.  I'll have Panes if I like.
And she was saying how happy you were to finally have them over.  Because you're both, so, what - introspective?  And you should have done it ages ago.  I'm Sophia Gold.  Come meet my husband, Cal.
I hope they're watercolors!
Yes.
Big time.
Oh honey, let's.
And Cal's this massive adult?
Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
We're fine.  We're great.  We're having a baby and we're moving to London.
Well...  I declared war!
It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.
You miss him?  <u>Why</u>?
I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
Really?
Why can't I just do whatever I want to do?  Why can't I just go wild?! Yahoo!
Wait!  When can I see you again?
No...as a matter of fact...
That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
Listen, "Princess", you can't order me around.  Out here, you're not the boss anymore -- out here, you're just --
Hlllllllp!
No -- we're going to attack the termites!
No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.  I can't feel my legs...
Duty calls!
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
Good.  You're a good soldier.
No, sir!
Royal victory party?  Will...will Princess Bala be there?
ONE TO NOTHING!
In love?  I'm just a plain old soldier at heart.  I'll tell you what I love -- the field -- blood -- death -- orders...and the company of other warriors.
...Not enough food?
But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
YES!!!  You know, people ask me, "Doctor, why are you always happy?" And I tell them it's mind over matter.  I don't <u>mind</u> that I don't <u>matter</u>!  Do you get it?  Do you get it?
Why are we so successful?
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
Yeah, I know.
That's right.  Maria Ouspenskaya. BLONDE  Hiya, Ouspenskaya.
Oh, you don't have to worry about that -- nothing in there that anybody would want to steal...  Good night, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
Shall we say -- a dollar?
Really?  I was looking at some figures from the Sickness and Accident Claims Division -- do you know that the average New Yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a year?
The characters you meet. Something happens to men in elevators. Must be the change of altitude -- the blood rushes to their head, or something -- boy, I could tell you stories --
I'm afraid not. I promised to have a drink with him -- he's been calling me all week --
Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
How is your cold?
They got a great little band at El Chico, in the Village -- it's practically around the corner from where you live.
Sounds good.  How do you know where I live?
Oh.
Eight-thirty!
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're tops. I mean, decency-wise -- and otherwise-wise.  Cheers.
Why not?  They seem friendly enough.
Maybe if I wore it a little more to the side --  is that better?
I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.
Why?
I think so.
Miss Kubelik --  -- you shouldn't be out of bed.
My head -- it feels like a big wad of chewing gum. What time is it?
In his apartment.
What's her first name?
No -- it's my stomach.
Give what up?
Cut.
No doubt about it.
Miss Kubelik, I don't think that's such a good idea.
Do I have to?
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
Yeah. Well -- that's the way it crumbles, cookie-wise. Go to sleep.
Yes, you are,  When I was straightening up the couch, you know what I found? Six hairpins, a lipstick, a pair of false eyelashes, and a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.
I guess so.
I wouldn't say that --  What would you like to have for diner? There's onion soup and canned asparagus --
You did?
Anyway, I parked the car and loaded the gun -- well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy -- I mean, how do you do it? -- here, or here, or here --  -- you know where I finally shot myself?
You ought to see my backhand.  And wait till I serve the meatballs. 
I don't?
You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.
Shut up and deal!
Gas?
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.
That's right, Baxter.
There's a certain key floating around the office -- from Kirkeby to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch -- it's the key to a certain apartment -- and you know who that apartment belongs to?
Who?
Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.
That's not the point. Four rotten apples in a barrel -- no matter how large the barrel -- you realize that if this ever leaked out --
Yes, sir.
The reason I called is -- I won't be home for dinner tonight. The branch manager from Kansas City is in town -- I'm taking him to the theatre Music Man, what else? No, don't wait up for me -- 'bye, darling.  Tell me something,  Baxter  -- have you seen Music Man?
Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home.
So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
Don't thank me -- thank your friends here -- they're the ones who recommended you.
Fine. And I want you to know I'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me -- SHELDRAKE Sure you will.  Say, Baxter, about the apartment - now that you got a raise, don't you think we can afford a second key?
Well -- I guess so.
Sir?
You see a girl a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're going to divorce your wife. I ask you -- is that fair?
What?
You left your wife?
Well, if you must know -- I fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?
Yes, sir.
You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
What do you mean, sorry?
No key!
I dig.
That's right, Mr. Sheldrake. I won't be needing it -- because I'm all washed up around here.
Save it. The old payola won't work any more. Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
Baxter, I don't want to pull rank on you -- but I told the lady it was all set -- you want to make a liar out of me?
Oh, I found a key there, all right -- only it's the wrong key.
Oh.  'Bye, Doc.
Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!
You know, Baxter, you're a real cutie-pie -- yes, you are.
Aren't you?
But you're not out of the woods yet, Baxter -- because most of them try it again!  You know where I am if you need me.
All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
Who is Mickey?
Oh. Mixed up in that revolution?
No.
You got a girl-friend?
The party's over.
Kubelik.
Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Let me take that.
It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
I missed you, Fran.
Like old times. Same booth, same song --
It's been hell.
I want you back, Fran.
You know I do.
I promise.
Well, that's more like it. At least you're speaking to me.
Okay, okay, Fran. I deserve that. But just ask yourself -- why does a man run around with a lot of girls? Because he's unhappy at home -- because he's lonely, that's why -- all that was before you, Fran -- I've stopped running.
I have a present for you. I didn't quite know what to get you -- anyway it's a little awkward for me, shopping --  -- so here's a hundred dollars -- go out and buy yourself something.
Of course I'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- I never took those pills -- I never loved you -- we never even met -- isn't that the way you want it?
I'd spell it out for you -- only I can't spell.
She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
It won't happen again.
Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat.
Well --
Good -- like I said, take your pick.
Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight -- what I meant was we'd need a whole drum for that --
We have a lot of pride in our unit --
Moonby what?
North ?
None.
Rangers, eh?
Sort of.
Fat. That's real fat.
Then went too far -- he sat there and starts mutilating the centerfold. Poking pins in her an' all that. Sergeant says, don't do her like that. You leave your shitty little hands off that girl. Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't do that again. You'll wish you hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked his iron to rock and roll and gave the little zero a long burst through the Playboy mag. Man, it blew him clean off the dock -- Hell, just the magazine was floatin' there all full of holes.
What did you put in all those ammo boxes?
What are you doing out here?
I don't believe you --
I don't know.
Whatdoya think it thinks.
All right with me, I used to drive a taxi.
'Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down.
Shot himself. What for ?
Where ?
When'd you do it?
Yeah -- like keep out --
What is it?
I never heard about that.
Anyone got a cigarette.
Do me a favor buddy, please.
I don't know. He was a lame, that's all.
But why ?
He couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill.
Your daughter.
How big it is?
What's the furthest you been in?
No. They put out two or three for every one I needed. When you get to the one you'll use, you just stake it out. If something feels wrong, you just pass it up. On one mission, I had to pass up three and ended up living on rats and chocolate bars.
Who knows.
Who?
The kid can't ride sloppy waves.
I'm Kurtz.
How's the pain?
What Truth?
No water.
You know what you're doing? You are interfering with my plans !
I had immense plans.
And you admired him?
He was a remarkable man. It was impossible not to --
Which one's the Colonel's?
The Yater -- the clear one with the thin stringer.
Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
Why didn't he shoot you?
We're going ashore. Tie her up -- and leave your guns up, Lance.
What things?
You can pack out of here -- two, three days' hike along this river at most.  Weather should hold this early in the season.
107  CONTINUED:
157  CONTINUED:
Six months.
I don't want to talk any more.
I have not, but I very much want to.  What do you know about the trouble in Devil's Cauldron?
The radio's on the fritz.
It's out by the pumping station, shot full of holes.
Be right back.  I left my camcorder in the car.
Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.
Do I want to be with you permanently?  Yes, I think I do. But be with what you do and the way you live?  That I don't know. C'mon, Eric, until I met you, coming back to Alaska was totally
Wait a second.
Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over.
I'm staying.
My home is here.  With you.
Yeah.  Maybe so.
That makes the flight more interesting.
-- Turn around.
I'm right behind you.
It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
We've got another two hours of daylight.
Going to be a bit of a challenge with handcuffs on.
I'm here to do my job.
You want to fool yourself about that bullshit job, fine.  Damn shame you have to drag your girlfriend along.  You think a woman like that will be happy making moose stew for a man -more-
Don't bet on it.
Don't try me.  I'll kill you if it comes to it.
-- Sam Wilder was my cousin. He's why I came to Alaska.  All his letters, saying what a paradise it is.  But me ending up dead won't do Sam a lick of good.
This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
I don't need one 'cause I know what's really going on here. I have to finish this letter or I'll go nuts.  This can't be right -- con- science.
Not bad.
Stay out of this...  Doctor?
Have they done blood tests on him?
Emergency room only.
It's not your table. It's the place's table. Behave. This once, you can sit at someone else's station.
We're all gonna die soon. I will. You will. It sure sounds like your son will.
No.
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
No!!! Stay away from me!
Carol the waitress?
I want your life for a minute where my big problem is someone offers me a free convertible so I can get out of this city.
Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
What you did changed my life.
My son.
No.
There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
Welcome.
Yes... sure.  I'll take the sofa.
Dancing?
Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out.
And?
No...  ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it.
One baked -- one fries.
There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might...
It was a mistake.
To hell with sex.
Do it then. Get the dog picked up. I can't believe you let it stay there.
It's your car but I don't want to hear it. If that means anything.
Yeah... Well...
How you doing?
Were you asleep?
You know what? I...
Well...
No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.
That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'
"What?" Look at you... You sense a mark.
Last word freak.
What's he look like?
Go away.
Rot in hell, Melvin.
Yo, yo, yo...
Did you like it that much?
What?
No fucking way.
What's your name?  We both know it's not Nicholai.
After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
What?  What's okay?
I ain't scared of you.
Do you want Rath or not?
Another contractor.
Then you can have the disks and I'll just walk out that door --
Because he took a contract on you. He'll come for you and he'll find you.
Yeah.
If Bain hadn't taken the contract on me, would you have?
Because I'm done.
He was Russian.  Nicholai Tachlinkov.  A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him.  When I heard he loved chess I became obsessed with the game.
He was killed.
Yes.  As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  That's all there is.  Until then, there is nothing.  You are nothing.
Why?
Nothing.
Why not?
What happens if you do?
Sorry.
Then, we wait.
That's right.
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
Ten years ago.
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
What?
Why in the hell would you take that chance?
He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.
Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
What?
How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
I called because I just want... I need to talk.
Can you tell me about it?
Right.
I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not.  I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't. It seems very funny to me.
Can I ask you a question?
Yeah.
American currency.
This will take some time.
It won't last, believe me. And you, when will you go back to the States?
And not even then sometimes.
Well, this place is too expensive so you've had it.
An alternative literary venue!
These guys think the West is just MTV and Hollywood movies. We've got to show them there's more to it.
Well, it's like I said, there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they're not private.... Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it, until they ran out of money.
Don't worry, I'll give you a hand as soon as I can.
I thought that was part of the charm!
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
Tough break.
Nope, not even close. I've thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though.
No....The Asylum!
None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts.
Yeah, I'll take some.
Destroy the evidence huh.
Could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
We're going to need it all.
Not yet, we need a few lengths of scaffold.
What?
You Romeo's sure pay a high price sometimes - anyone I know?
She's as American as apple pie too. Have you figured out exactly what it is you despise about them?
He's lying! I am.
So I hear.
Huh?
They ain't the only ones.
He got that one right.
Maybe, but I've started to wonder what those files were all about. Suppose it was old KGB stuff and had the dirt on big people or maybe the personnel records of the secret police, that might explain all the hassle and the cover-up.
Yeah, somewhere?
Siberia.
Good, what's his number?
Doug, I can't just leave you!
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....
Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
Have you met Holly? Josh's friend.
Sure. Excellent.
Really?
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
Well not any more, now I'm a serious writer and above this crap.
But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it.
You're everything a guy could want.
What? You are crazy!
Let's have a look anyway.
I'm not a bloody teenager okay, I told you I can't do that shit.
Look, if you can get them to finish it by Friday, you and your friends can do the opening performance that night.
Don't go making it too simple, we're on the cutting edge here.
Yeah, great....Dobchay! It will dry, yes?
Good, great....Dobchay!
I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.
Two hundred dollars, make it six thousand crowns?
Will this thing take long?
Am I invited?
Yeah, we'd better keep them for now, I'll try and get some glasses for tomorrow night.
No, just a coffee.
Guests.
Sometimes.
I'll need to make a phone call.
Good, wait here, it will not take long and then you may go.
Working....Under cover.
A drill, what are you up to?
Come on, that shit can wait.
No way, he even gave me back pay.
What for?
Yeah and you're a slut, so what?
That was not my decision, I can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored. In the meantime no one else must know those files exist. Secure the building and I will arrange alternative safe storage immediately.
All the more reason to eliminate him.
Yeah.
That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
That'd be something.
He wants to talk to you.
She's not. She's got her own ideas.
-- This play means a lot to me.
My act?!
Ambitious.
And you have to meet my father.
Don't bother!
I hope so.  I think maybe she sees me now.
Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
No.
You don't believe in anything?
Interpreted by another guy like my father.
You don't miss a thing.
Belinda's a very jealous person.
That would be the reason.
Yeah, with a finish in about a decade.
We're doing something -- ?
What are you talking about?
You're straddling the state line. You're in two places at once.
I'm sure. Pretty sure.
Maybe you're not supposed to.
Twice a year.
Before the divorce. My father used to take me here. Fire spotting was his summer job.
What would you do up here?
I'm always home by midnight and he's always asleep.
That what you do?
Yes, one of many.
Anything you want.
'Find out who you are and do it on purpose.' Dolly Parton.
You'll be fine for a few minutes.
By making me ill, he is punishing me!  I just don't know what for.
Let's get something straight. You don't know me. I don't know you. But I know what you're about.  Keep your distance from this house -- and from Jamie.
So talk to us about something.
Either. Both.
Getting by.
Jamie wanted that. She told me.
I want to come back.
Besides attending all your regular classes, I'd like you to help our janitorial staff after school --
I'd work backstage or something?
-- You can and you will, Mr. Carter.
Where's your old man?
This is 1952....?
Marty. What's for breakfast?
Learn anything?
But he does! Don't you see?
Jeez, what do you think? To see it!
Christ, it's a miracle I was even born! 
Lemme see that.
Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear?
All I can say is, that's one helluva attitude, Mr. McFly. 'Let's explode a hundred megaton Geothermal nuclear device, just to see it.'
Marty. Marty Lewis.
Well, yeah, I was thinking, if cars are gonna be going two or three hundred miles an hour, they're gonna be using an awful lot of gas. Like, what if we run out?
Pro! Release the rope!
Oh -- Marty -- what time did you say it was?
Marty.
The power converter...
We don't....
Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?
I don't know, but I don't want to take any chances! Now you stay here and don't do anything. Don't answer the door, don't answer the phone, don't go outside. Understand?
Okay, Professor, I get where you're coming from. The way I look, the way I'm dressed...  I'd stick out like a sore thumb.
You're talking crazy! An atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds!
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
Curious... Very curious....
Good. Professor Brown tested the tarp, noting in satisfaction that it was secure. I'll pick you up in front of the school at midnight. Don't be late -- we're cutting it close as it is. We've got a long drive ahead of us.
Perfect...
Curious...  Very curious.
According to your girlfriend, Suzy Parker, you and she were at the movies. You went to the restroom and you never came out. Obviously, you stepped through an inter-dimensional time warp, created by the original operation of the time machine.
It's the most beautiful city I've ever seen! What is it?
What happened to Dick Wilson?
No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him.
You expect me to believe that?
Okay.
Long as my ammo held out... Right there's where you caught me.
Thirty aught six.
Well, it's not good enough.  Just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you, Kit? Guy like you.
What're you doing?
Well. I got some stuff to say. Guess I'm kind of lucky that way. Most people don't have anything on their minds, do they?
He'll say that?
I know.
Don't ask me.
What?
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
Yeah.
Soon as I start the car... and fix my hat.
Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here. I mean, there's no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat.
Really?
No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by.
Maybe.
Name is Carruthers. Believe I shoot people every now and then. Not that I deserve a medal.
They're stealing my chopper!
I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, just in case.
There's a Harley behind those bushes.  Get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula.  We don't have time to ask questions. Just synthesize it-
Have you warned Professor Hikita?
And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...
Figures.  Anybody seen my scope?
Don't shoot!
Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...
My name's, Penny!  But who cares?
Who does?  It's a crazy mixed-up world.  Just do the best you can with what you have...
Don't go to pieces.  I haven't got time tonight.
What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
That's just what you would say.  This is so unreal.  I'm dreaming...
Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness?
Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
Cause Buckaroo needs me here.
No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.
Well, usually, they're... simply morality tales. There's a good wrestler, and a bad wrestler whom he confronts at the end. In between, the good wrestler has a love interest or a child he has to protect.  Bill would usually make the good wrestler a backwoods type, or a convict. And sometimes, instead of a waif, he'd have the wrestler protecting an idiot manchild.  The studio always hated that. Oh, some of the scripts were so... spirited!
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
Before Bill came to Hollywood.
Bill –
Oh yeah? What kind of write?
What DID you mean?
I – I've got respect for – for working guys, like you –
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
And what would that be, son?
I need help, Audrey.
I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're producing this Wallace Beery picture I'm working on.
What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.
I didn't say anything-
I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.
That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work –
What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
Oh, it's an exciting time then. I'm not the best-read mug on the planet, so I guess it's no surprise I didn't recognize your name. Jesus, I feel like a heel.
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, I'll let you know if I'm bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view.
Mine have passed on. It's just the three of us now...
Okay, but hell, you should know what it is. I can show you in about thirty seconds.
That's all right, really –
...Yeah, okay.
Hi, Charlie.
In a few days. Out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact – New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office.
Why don't we go to your room-
Don't worry about it, Barton. We can sort it-
You gotta believe me –
Yeah.
You're in pictures, Barton. Even if you got cleared eventually, this would ruin you.
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
Funny, huh, when everything that's important to a guy, everything he wants to keep from a lifetime – when he can fit it into a little box like that. I guess... I guess it's kind of pathetic.
I hear it's Mundt. Madman Mundt.
Because you DON'T LISTEN!
Lou.
KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!
Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider –
Yes sir, they –
I'm checking in. Barton Fink.
Well, I'm going to be working here, mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do you have room service?
Also known as Madman Mundt.
He's a little funny in the head.
All of which he's now missin'.
Anyway.
Excellent picture.
Hell, I could take you through it step by step, explain why your story stinks, but I won't insult your intelligence. Well all right, first of all: This is a wrestling picture; the audience wants to see action, drama, wrestling, and plenty of it. They don't wanna see a guy wrestling with his soul – well, all right, a little bit, for the critics – but you make it the carrot that wags the dog. Too much of it and they head for exits and I don't blame 'em. There's plenty of poetry right inside that ring, Fink. Look at "Hell Ten Feet Square".
All night?
Yes.
Thank you.
Yeah?  Well why don't you find some friendly therapist and work some of that hostility out.  But take my advice.  Put a little more life into it than you usually do.
What did she tell me, Beth?
She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
About a year and a half.
Did you leave the club with him?
Only when they make interesting reading.
No.  I said I liked Johnny to use his hands.  I don't give any rules, Nick.  I go with the flow.
Yes it does, doesn't it?
Thanks.
It's got to be tiring to beat that machine.
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
No.  Come in.
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
Do you?
What if I call you Nicky?
It's not the same thing, is it?
To see if I can get away with it.
I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character.
For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldn't frame me.
I don't know.
Did you?  What's she doing?
No thanks.
I told you.  She kills him.
Really.  Maybe that's why you're from Homicide.  How?
.38 revolver.  Never recovered.
Were there ever any suspects?
Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.
I never heard of him.
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
I don't give a... flyin'... chili- bean... fart about AIDS!
Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.
How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
He was I.A.  He probably asked her about it.
She's a writer -- it's part of what she does.
Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written.  What are you -- a book critic?
Fuck you, too Nick.
I told you to stay away from Tramell.
She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.
Only if you're making it.
Wow... Stop giving them away.  I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me?
What's wrong?
It's OK. Just have him bring you to dinner at Mr. Chow's later. We'll be there.
You mean like an ape?
I see..  And... How do you respond to being called – hmmm...  – yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."
SAMO.
We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist – she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.
I am... On Gina.  Fuck – I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
He drops dead! See? Just do your shit like you do it! Your friends like you, you get laid, everyone walks by, sees your stuff everywhere. It's good. What else do you want?
What's your fuckin' problem, anyway?
What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.
'Uppity?' Like as in 'uppity nigger?'
Hey fuck you! I deserve this shit. You're just jealous 'cause it ain't happening to you!
C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
Me? Why?
Thanks
Have a Mac.
What is it you want? Respect? I have respect for you, just for making this call. One philosopher said "Sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." Think about it. Feel it.
My point exactly.
What time is it?
Yeah.
I need this?
I'm here for an interrogation. You've been called a graffiti artist and I wanna know why. All I see are scribble scrabble abstractions!
I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
Better than you know, Bat-boy.
Ah, the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
I'm listed.
And it's not even accurate ... I mean, "Batman Blows It"?  The guy probably prevented <u>millions</u> in property damage.
I heard on TV, "Catwoman is thought to weigh 140 pounds."  How do these hacks <u>sleep</u> at night?
Nope, I told her everything.
And the truth frightened her?
Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
Ah ... then you've come to the right lonely mansion.
Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge <u>or</u> the jury... I mean, just who do you think you <u>are</u>?
Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
Weird, huh?
Yawn.
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
My lips are sealed.
Actually, it's a lot like that.
Ten years.  Barbara isn't really me niece, sir. She's Joanna Clark's daughter.
I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
Thanks.
Not all heroes wear masks.
Right here, sir.
Coming on line now, sir.
It appears, sir, that someone has stolen the batsignal.
I recognized the accent.
Keep it.
Servants, Masters, it's  ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
Be ready for anything.
I don't know.  It just feels right.
Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
No, Robin.  He's going to jail.
I thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs.
How about, nice to see you?  Glad you're here to save my life.
Surf's up.
I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
A poison kiss?  You have some real issues with women, you know that?  You just couldn't stand that she was about to kiss me.  Couldn't stand that something might be mine and not yours.  Could you?!
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
I see you knew him.
Acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet.
But soon...
Wild doesn't exactly cover it.
Well, I, my most unabominable snowman, have been impressed by you. In fact I propose a pairing.  So I'm here to set you free.
You lie!
Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
Hop away little bunny.  Before I cool your jets.  Permanently.
What exactly are you working on in there?  What are those screams?
I think they're getting worse.
If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
I don't know, sir. Your dear parents.  Suddenly gone. So much loss...
Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
What?
Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
Just checking, young sir.
I didn't know that. See? You _are_ interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name? Or do I just call you bats?
Last night at the circus. I noticed something about Dent. His coin. He's obsessed with justice. It's his Achilles' heel. It can be exploited.
You like strong women. I've done my homework. Or do I need skin-tight vinyl and a whip?
Maybe you just haven't met the right woman...
Oh please. You're blind as a bat.
Nygma. Edward Nygma. You hired me. Personally. Just like I tell everyone.  Well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip.
You understand obsession better than you let on.
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
Look, spare me the sermons, okay. You're just some rich guy who is trying to do a good deed. You don't even know me.
Absolutely not.
Me and my brother Chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire. Dad's knee was going. Chris was engaged, you know that? Two-Face took...everything. Now I can pay him back.
We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school.
Don't bogart that 'trode.
You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
Actually, I wanted to talk to Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne, would you?
So did I, once. But I kept coming back, and... I guess I became the thing I feared most.
Photo database. I'll do your photos now.
I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale.
I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.
Because I...  ... Because she'd never speak to me again.
I'll take you home if you'd like.
Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
Sometimes... I don't know if there's enough of me left to save.
Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.
I'm frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you.
All right, Bruce, what do you suggest?
WHAT??
Don't let your job interfere with your business.  -- Someone's been talking to Harvey Dent.
Why, Eckhardt.  You should be thinking about the future.
Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right?  No big loss.
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
That's it?
Unfortunate, but I think we can work around it.
A visual record, yes.  A before-and- after kind of thing.  This could make your reputation.
Strong stomach, huh?  I like that in a woman -- Maybe we can do business after all.
Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it, Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later, who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.
Right.  And they know him.  And that's why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for --
Don't ask him about work, Charlie. Life's too short.
Tom Jones?
I had the last strawberry in the refrigerator.
0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know.
It's okay.  There's no one out here. Just open the door.  Trust me.
Annie, it's me.
Ahm.....
Well, Ahm....
It's great when people who work together can become real friends.
Thanks, David.  Always a pleasure.
Thank you Bernie.  Well done.  Now, If you'll excuse - I have a little smartening up to do myself.
I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
Quite right, sir.
A car sounds sensible.
Richard Burton was very good-looking.
But is she gonna be okay?
off the peg?
NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird.  What do you think it is, Dad?  Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting.
It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.
Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh heh. Anus. Heh heh.
Heh heh. Yeah.
Heh heh. This is the best night of our lives.
Forget it, bunghole!
Yeah, heh heh. Damn right!
My butt's bothering me!
Uh...
Ow! I'll kick your butt!
Dammit!!!! Dammit!!!!
Uh, probably, huh huh...Whoa, I think my life is like, flashing in front of my eyes!
Huh? Huh huh.
Yeah. We can go see Hole and then we can get some hole. Huh huh huh huh.
Could you, like, tell her we're ready to score?
What's your problem Beavis?
Yeah, maybe some chicks too. Heh heh.
Turd-burglar...
That's alright. I'd rather not know your real names anyways. I'm Muddy. Look, I'm gonna get right to the point. I'll pay you ten grand plus expenses, all payable after you do her...
Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
I hope to score big there myself. I'm mostly going to be doing the slots.
Oh, there are so many slots you won't know where to begin.
Oh, that's nice.
Heh heh, thanks.
Uh, we didn't score yet.
Um, um, yeah, probably. Heh heh.
Dammit!  Where's that damn unit??!!
Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
That's better. Yes?
D.C., Chief.
Bork, when this is all over, remind me to make you an appointment with Agent Hurley.
Agent Hurley...
She sure does.
Cool, huh huh.  Hey Beavis that's that dude that's paying us to do his wife.
Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we could do you. And he was gonna pay us.
Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll pay ya twenty if you go back there and do mah husband.
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
Adam!
Yeah it turned out okay.  We applied for a National Historical plaque for it.  That'll be the third one on Main Street.
You're doing it, Adam.  You're saving this town.
I'm not sure.  It feels... frozen.
This is going to take some time.
In heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper.
Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
At least we won't have to worry about her.
<u>You</u> left me.
She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
No.  But it's somewhere without big worms.
Think of them as death shrouds. And the moaning is important. Really <u>moan</u>!  Practice, practice, practice.
... Yes this must be him.  Look... Betelgeuse... Betelgeuse...
Maybe we should knock first?
Let's see if she can get my model back.
3:30 I guess.
Is this like a trick question?
You don't know the Deetzes very well, do you?  My father bought this place.  He never walks away from equity.  Why don't <u>you</u> leave?
I got an A!
You don't kill anyone.
Pity.  Murderers seem to have an easy time of it.  Just look at Amityville.  He was one of my boys.  Didn't have to give that one any lessons. From day one... But I must be off ... I've got a planeload of football players crashed in the midwest... they need a lot of help, just with the basics.
No.  You don't want his help.
He's a freelance bio-exorcist. Claims to get rid of the living. But he's a troublemaker.  He's pushy.  He's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
About what?
Funeral.  God, you guys <u>really are</u> <u>dead</u>!  What was it like?  The funeral. Did you cry?
Wait... I don't think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we're up here.
That's right, Jane.  Complete vacation.
And live in what, our station wagon?
That's it!
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
Just <u>say</u> it.
Let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because I've bought options on property all over town.  I need Max's financing...
Well this is... I mean, this is the weirdest --
They're ghosts.  They do what they want.
Otho, can you do it?
Joke!  Joke!  Aspirin!  It doesn't matter what brand.
Of <u>course</u> we weren't scared.  Just a little startled.  One of those sushi dropped down my Kamali.
I'm sorry already.
<u>I know</u>... I read your book, <u>The</u> <u>Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf</u>.
Attic space.
She's been without therapy up here and I will not allow her to ruin...
Look at the tiny figures.
I don't know.
The attic.
Now, you'll barely feel this. It won't hurt at all.
I see.
Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's?
Shame on you, Chauncey - you should let me be the judge of that.  Please, sit in the chair.
I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.
Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.
At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.
No, Eve... I'm sorry.
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
Well, I still don't believe I know the man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, hold still.
Oh, yes.
No. I like it here.
He does...?
That's good.
Yes. I was.
Of course.
Yes, Eve. You'll be all right.
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
Hello, Dennis.
Hello, Sid.
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
Yes. It's a very good show.
Do you like it?
Yes, I do, it's very good.
Do you think so? Do you think so?
Yes, it is.  Would you tell me your name again, please?
Yes. I like that very much.
I agree.
Yes. I am very hungry.
... Oh?  Robert, take a look, would you?
And, please, Chauncey - don't rush your decision. I know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment.
Good. Together, the two of you should create quite a stir - I can already hear the gossip.
She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say?
Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...
Yes. I like to watch.
Oh, Mr. Rand, of course. Right this way, sir.
Yes.
No.  That's where Joe fixed the bricks.
Yes.
I assure you, sir, David is a very careful driver. Please, won't you let us take you?
You're gonna need somebody, someone's gotta be around for you, boy...  ... You oughta find yourself a lady, Chance...  But I guess it oughta be an old lady, 'cause you ain't gonna do a young one any good, not with that little thing of yours...  ... You're always gonna be a little boy, ain't you?  ... Goodbye, Chance...
Yes.
Fine, then let's get started. The current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and I would like to know if you agree with the President's view of the economy?
Yes, I know the garden very well. I have worked in it all my life. It is a good garden and a healthy one; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers, as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons. The garden needs a lot of care. I do agree with the President; everything in it will grow strong, and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds.
Yes, Thomas - I understand.
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
... You've quite a sense of humor, Mr. Chance - but all kidding aside, may I ask just what you are doing here?
No.
Yes, I will.
Now, Ben, did you happen to get a chance to...
... Spring and summer...  Yes, I see... Fall and winter.  Yes, indeed...  Could you go through that one more time, please, Mr. Gardiner?
... Nothing.
Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
Would you two excuse me for a moment?
Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...
... Yeah...
Good night.
Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language.
Right, Chief.
I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.
Yes, chief - eight other foreign powers have put Gardiner under surveillance. We're around-the clock now, sir - I'll keep you posted.
Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
Mr. Gardiner...
Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
May 11th.
They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
I'm scared.
I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing.  I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing?
You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. We’ll smoke a joint.  Tensions will melt away.
We wish.
I'm a puppeteer.
I need a shower.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
Holy shit! He said what I said!
You suggest what? I have no time for piddling suggestions from mumbling job applicants, my good man. Besides, Dr. Lester will see you now. I think that's what he said.
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think.  I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.
One hundred and five. Carrot juice.  Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.
Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
Thank you, sir.
Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops!
Somebody told you.
I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
Yeah. But enough about me.
My tits?
Good. Now we're getting somewhere.  Not a chance.
Sure. It'd be fun.
My God.
I've fallen in love.
It is better to light one candle than curse the darkness. I learned that from you.
Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire!
Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes!
Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.
Look, I'm going back to my house to ponder this. So stay calm and keep track of Schwartz's comings and goings. Oh, and somebody dispose of Schwartz's wife, will you?  Nice to meet you all.
Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
But I think I have another plan.
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
Gehginnis ondah foam?
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
Count me in.
Good. I think its time to beckon Mr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us out of this pickle.
No.
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
Maxine...
I have to see you.
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
Who needs dancing?
It's just that I fantasize about you and, well, speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and...
No, I guess not. I'm an actor.
Oh shut up.  Craig, darling are you in there?
It's okay, my sweet.
I've got to leave Malkovich.
There ain't.
Folks come. Folks go.
Say the Word!
That's the last thing they took from me.
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
I'm saying they came into my yard.
I WILL PROTECT YOU.
You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
Don't pay to complain.
Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it.
You grown.
Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
Oh.
You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman...Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.
That was fun.
But mama..
She likes this dress...
Might see anything at all at 124.
What run him off? Tell me that!
And he left when he found out what Sethe did?  What you say casts a different light on it, I guess...I thought-
Oh yeah. I got big plans.
She was only-
Yes sir.
You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse.
Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
Wasn't this guy supposed to be a millionaire?
Oh, man, don't say that..
Her life is in your hands, Dude. And report back to us as soon as it's done.
But I guess she told Dieter.
That guy treats women like objects, man.
Who're you working for?  Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?
This is a hundred and eighty dollars.
Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should compensate me for the fucking rug. I mean his wife goes out and owes money and they pee on my rug.
I am the Walrus.
I'm going home, Donny.
Were you listening to the story, Donny?
Shut the fuck up, Donny.
What's wrong with Walter, Dude?
That fucking bitch!
I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.
They were Nazis, Dude?
We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
Fuckin' A, man.  I got a rash. Fuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya Tony.
That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when--
Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right, Mrs.  Reagan on the left, taken when--
Different mothers, huh?
I see.
--smoking thai-stick, breaking into the ROTC--
One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you.
Mm.
Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered if I'd see you again.
Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters, ups and downs.
Which one was Logjammin'?
Of course you do.  I can see you're anxious for me to get to the point. Well Dude, here it is.  Where's Bunny?
I thought you might know, man.
But she hasn't run off, she's been--
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal.  Which bothers some men.  The word itself makes some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.
Right, but let me explain something about that rug--
I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.
She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim.
Oh?
He helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance.  He has no money of his own.  I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut.
Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner. In fact I don't want the father to be someone I have to see socially, or who'll have any interest in rearing the child himself.
What the fuck are you--
Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?
No, but--
You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
State of Israel.  If you will it, Dude, it is no--
This is a league game.  This determines who enters the next round- robin, am I wrong?
They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands!
Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say peep when I'm doing business here.
I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
Huh?  Oh, him, yeah.  Well I don't see, um-- what exactly is the problem?
That's right, Dude, 1  % certain--
For Christ's sake, Dude.
Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--
Now Dude--
And let's also not forget--let's not forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city-- that isn't legal either.
No, I'm--
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
No.
Uh.
We know it's his fucking homework, Walter!  Where's the fucking money, you little brat?
His million bucks was never in it, man!  There was no money in that briefcase!  He was hoping they'd kill her!  You throw out a ringer for a ringer!
Huh?
I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death--
I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.
Come on, Walter!.
It's a heart attack.
A hundred and eighty dollars?!
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
Are you employed, sir?
Employed?
Is this a--what day is this?
I don't know, sir.
Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life.  Are you surprised at my tears, sir?
They did not receive the money, you nitwit!  They  did not receive the goddamn money.  HER LIFE WAS IN YOUR HANDS!
No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not occurred to me.
Well, you have your story, I have mine.  I say I entrusted the money to you, and you stole it.
Help me put him back in his chair.
YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
This is a league game, Smokey!
Wanna hear something more impressive? My first twenty fights were stumblebums handpicked by my manager. My girlfriend saw you fight a couple times over at the Olympic. Says maybe you <i>could</i> take me.
He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
Minutes.
If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
Fry 'em.
I'll show you.
Where the hell have you been?
For what?
Not alone.
Scud.
Back when Blade had me hunting down your puckered old ass.  What's up with your hair, anyway?  Fucking Willie Nelson look-a-like?
Maybe not. I did some checking, she's a hematologist. Knowledge like that might come in handy.
You don't have a few minutes, Frost.
Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up.
The way they move, they way they smell --
We've got a good arrangement, that's all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story.
I'm just tired, that's all. We've been up all night.
You make it sound like I'm already dead.
I don't know. I woke up just before you did --
For them. But for me --
He looks different now, burns are less extreme, some of these wounds have closed up --
A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won't be necessary after tonight.
Why? Because we live at another species' expense? Your people farm cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening them up with steroids? It's called evolution, Doctor. Survival of the fittest.
Get away from him!
So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
Which is why you're here. We could use someone with your experience.
Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and I'm not getting any younger, am I?
With a retrovirus. It's injected into the bone marrow cells, it causes the host's DNA to mutate. They've been using them to treat Sickle-cell anemia.
I don't know, but the back-up generator should've kicked in.
What're you doing there?
I was out hiking, camping the past two days--that's what did it--<u>I</u> killed it--
Look, this is not my field of expertise. You seem stabilized, but why take any chances? Let's keep you overnight and have the Staff obstetrician do a follow-up tomorrow.
Christ.
Oh, sorry, right.
You can be goddamn sure, though, I'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when I get back to Baltimore--I get proof who stole my shit and I call the cops!
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
--scared the living shit out of us.
I can't.
Something. Someone.
Like hell. Play the goddamn tape.
Fine.
--and unlike the first one, every second of it's gonna be true! "Blair Witch: The Real Story!"
Shut-up.
Why does everyone here but me have have a gigantic stick up their ass?
If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.
No fucking.
Just go.
Su casa y shit-o hole-o.
I spend a lot of time on e-Bay. Buying, selling--sometimes buying then re-selling at substantial mark-up, sometimes just selling crap I find in the street.
Gimme it!
--anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all the time--fucking owl--
Heather, does that look like Domini there?
No one ever comes here.
This isn't about us.
--now there.
Spite.
They were making a movie--if they were going to steal anything it'd be <u>just</u> the tapes, to see if we had anything they didn't.
--oh, Jesus--
All the shit that was worth anything, yes. You'd be amazed, though, what you can get free on the 'net.
See what turns up--which I guarantee will be nothing. Some of the rest of the party are more hopeful--
At least you still have the tapes.
--and we brought it back with us!
Motion. Stop there. Play it again.
--she wasn't a witch--we embrace nature, not evil--
We're not dealing with fucking logic here!
--fuck Anna!
His daughter, for God's sake-- I need to know if he's heard from her this morning.
--the Sheriff's Office--
--yes, Ma'am, can I help you with anything else?--
I am?
You wouldn't be putting me out.
...Huh?
What do you want to know?
You want to hustle me. I don't want to be hustled. It's as simple as that. Now that I've communicated, why don't you leave?
And how many room got TV, Dusty?
Sign.
Yeah.
I don't particularly want to talk to you.
Jesus, I don't believe it...
How would I know?
Right.
Tuesday is ladies' night.
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go.
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. goddam!!! This is the suavest guy I know. look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. this beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. it makes me puke.
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Yes.
It's blue. blue velvet.
Yeah.
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
Oh my God. Is her son OK?
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Oh he forced you, huh?
Okay, I'm goin'. You'll see. I'll get you.
Shit. You better tell me something.
I . I don't know.
No. What is happening?
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police.
Okay. I know you've been scared. now you want to scare someone.
Come on Dorothy.
There's no disease, I can tell you.
You look beautiful to me.
Oh God, Jeffrey. is that you? Oh God.
They hurt his head.
I don't want to go.
What?
Yes.
I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!
Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
Terrible. boring.
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
Alright.
Let's go.
You didn't goof it up, but. you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday. do you have a date tonight?
Yes. I do.
Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date. that does that.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Yeah. but.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
That's what I thought.
You better not, Jeffrey.
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret.
I can't dance fast.
Really?
Dorothy Vallens?
Right. Watch out for Mike, there.
No Jeffrey!!
Well.
What plane?  We going someplace?  Where we headed?  You have your money.  It's all there.  What the fuck is going on?
Motherfucker works fast.
Five-thousand per kilo.
Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
Yeah.  I am.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
No, I cam here out of my own volition.
What details?  I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
Excuse me?
You.  Your responsibility is over.  You do not fly.  You are not a pilot.  You are not a distributor.  You introduced us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane.  That is all.  You make a percentage.  A generous one.  And you're lucky to get that.
Diego needs to see you right away, please.  Excuse us, Amorcito.
I guess not.  Okay.  You know, you're very lucky you're friends of Barbie's. If you weren't, I'd never talk to you.
I heard.
No fucking way.
Your offense?  Why are you here?
What kind of project?
Never mind.  Not for you to worry.
Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
I'm tired, Diego.  Go to bed.
In my country, I am a magico.  A man with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To take nothing and make it something, okay?  I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish.  That is why I am in your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream.  Do you have a dream, George?
You failed because you had the wrong dream.
No, no.  That is where you are wrong. For us, it is cheap.  In Medellin, we buy for six-thousand dollars a kilo.  IN Miami, we sell for sixty.
Oh my G-d.
Don't worry.  We will talk of everything.  We have the time.  You arrive here with a Bachelor of Marijuana, but you will leave with a Doctorate of Cocaine.
Do we need a plane?  How does this work? When do I see you?
Right.  Now who is the person in California?  The connection?
Yeah.  You do the talking.
We're half a million off.
Try the closet.
In how long?  A week?
Who's the cheapskate?
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
I know.
Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?
I meant every word of it.
Put that shit away, they're here.
I said, I've seen it before.
Don't touch me.  Tell me.  Just answer the question.  What do I spend?  What? How will we live?
Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love her, y'know?  I kind of want to have her.  I've been away for so long.  Make up for the missed time, you know?
Yeah, sure, whatever.
There's schools in California.
Not today, George.  Time to go back.
Who's the co-pilot?
Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet everybody.
So, we need to get to the source.
You know, he's got a point.  We're fucking Americans.  We stick out like sore thumbs.
The strike is a success; but ...
It's true.
Sure. By shooting at me.
Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
You still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.
It's a question of habit ...
To show them to the UN, right?
Rue de Thèbes? In the Upper Casbah, I think ...
Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
We don't trust you, colonel. Come forward, show yourself.
Okay, I'll make the statement in writing ...
I'm trying.
It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.
An inquiry into what?
The official cause?
So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?
What did they argue about?
No.  Miss Lawson came in here voluntarily to answer your questions. She doesn't have to sit here and be insulted.  So, either you charge her now or we're leaving.
She planned this.  She wanted us to find the nasal spray.
Yeah.  Well -- we'll let the blindfolded lady with the scales decide that.
I'm just curious to see if Mr. Troxell reconstructed anything else.
Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office on at least two occasions.
Six years.
About a year and half ago.
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
Intense.
She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her.  My doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that.  You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her.  How deeply you want to please her.  At first it started off slowly -- but the rhythm built and built.    Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop.  Eventually I started to have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just kept going -- faster and faster.  No matter what I said she wouldn't stop. I really thought for a moment I was going to die.
Yes.
No.
No.
Then you have no way of knowing what Mr. Marsh told Miss Lawson were the reasons for his visits?
No.  No, I don't.
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
No.
Where did you meet him?
No.
Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death?
I thought he was a kind, gentle man?
Money isn't the only reason people commit murder, Miss Braslow.
She talked him into it.  She wanted everything.
Because you were jealous.  Because he cut you out of the will.  Because you have a cocaine habit to feed -- because you know that if Rebecca Lawson is found guilty the new will is void -- and there's a very good chance the old one would be honored.
Frank -- what are you doing here?
I'm not asking for names or specifics.  I just want to know what prompted you to make the call?
And she left shortly after that?
No further questions.
We started talking.  In fact, we talked until four in the morning.  We discovered we shared a lot of the same interests.  After that we were together all the time until he left. He used to call me every night after he came back.  Then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him. I've never left.
Is it against the law?
Yes -- she did.
Andrew loved this old cabin.  He always dreamed about moving to Tahiti -- living in a hut and becoming a beach-bum.  I could never imagine myself doing that -- but somehow when he talked about it, he made it sound so alive - - so wonderful.  Soft ocean breezes and beautiful sunsets -- leaving the world and it's problems behind.  I wish he'd had a chance to do it.
It won't be that hard.
Yeah.
What?
No, I don't have to believe you.  The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.
Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.
Honey.
I knew you were thinking that.  I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.
No -- I'm a survivor.
Well, I guess that makes you the best.  Look, Frank -- she stands to inherit three million dollars.  As executors of the estate and her attorneys that could generate a lot of legal fees for us.  All I'm asking you to do is talk to her.
That's it, Mr. Dulaney.  Take a seat.
How often do you use cocaine?
I can think of worse ways to go--
SO!
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that.
I'm sure you haven't done anything. Have some iced tea. How are the kids?
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
Don't say that!
How did she meet him? Did Dad know? Anything else in that envelope?
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
This is crazy. She waits till she's dead to tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That's enough for me. I don't have to know who she was.
No. We're going to lock this up and --
Nobody did.
Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.
No, what?
Heat is heat.
No, of course not. I'll just clean up.
I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
No, really?
Oh, yeah. Actually, I had an assignment in Greece and I had to go through Bari to get the boat at Brindisi. But it looked so pretty I got off and stayed for a few days. Breathtaking country.
Francesca. Robert.
Not at all.
I'm so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason.
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
Why?
Yes. Very clean.
I feel so embarrassed.
Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
You sound like an artist.
You're asking a man if he's too tired to talk about himself? You don't get out much, do you?
No, you rub it on you. I have some in the truck. Don't go away.
This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?
You must get lonely at times.
No.
I told you, I love other people.
No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was an inappropriate thing to ask.
It's okay. It's not that hot anymore. Thanks God.
I bet you could do a book.
Try and live a lifetime before Friday. Cram it all in. 
I know you! What can this possibly mean to anyone who doesn't "need" meaning -  "Who goes with the Mystery" -- who pretends he isn't scared to death.
I DON'T WANT TO NEED YOU!
No matter how much distance we put between us and this house, I bring with it with me. And I'll feel it every minute we're together. And I'll blame loving you for how much it hurts. And then even these four days won't be anything more than something sordid and... a mistake.
I want to keep it forever. I want to love you the way I do now the rest of my life. Don't you understand -- we'll lose it if we leave. I can't make an entire life disappear to start a new one. All I can do is try to hold onto to both. Help me. Help me not lose loving you.
Robert, if that happens, you'll have to decide. I won't be able to.
I can't sleep.
I'm not sick, Richard. I'm just not tired, now go back to sleep before you're up for the whole night too!
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
I don't remember!
You people really don't like dogs.
It's the only way.  It's possible your father may not be dead yet.
Well, close the fucking door by all means.  But don't expect me to go down there and do it.
He yours, sir?
Then what do you care?
Alright.  Yes sir.  Anything you say.
What's your problem with Crippled Dick?
Look around, this place is a dump!  Naw, it'd have to work to be a dump.
Maurice, man, shut the fuck up.
Damn.  It's so...fresh.
Yeah, there is a strange vibe here.
Damned if I know.
But things change.  You gotta think ahead.
It ain't the money - it's the high.  The big fat floating 'what if?'  And it's way more profitable.  Nobody ever wins.  So you never have to pay out.
Those 'fools' are my people.
What?
Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.
You know I can't.
Then fuck it!!!
Please.  It's for your own good.
Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.
Yeah.  But when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. The fabric tears.
And you believe her?
If I did, I wouldn't come within fifty yards of your door.
A little business move I made.  On my own.  I think you're gonna approve.
You'll take care of it?  Not this time. No way.  I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.
You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
Bullshit, Dad.  Don't front me.  For once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came from there, too.
Look, even if anyone found anything there, it's twenty years ago.  They could never connect it to us.
Oh, no.  Please don't make me go by myself.  I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
Yeah, you heard of him?
Not that I remember.
No thanks.
How could that be?  The box was packed!
Moe's terms.
Somehow I don't think he stabbed himself in the chest, then buried himself too.
I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
What's that, Johnnie?
You're a dead man!  A fucking dead man!
Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!
I can't.  I can't.
Jesus, Caesar!
It was unbelievable!  Un-fucking- believable!
It's impossible!
But you know he did it.
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
I need you ...
No I didn't.  Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here.  Then they never showed up.
Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at yourself, Caesar.  You're a thug. |You launder money for the mob.  You rent women like you rented this apartment.
They were in a car accident.
You know he would have done you, too.
Sure.
Either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face.
When I reach ten, then I'll start with you.
Are you okay, Violet?
What?  They ain't there?
...  thank you.
Pretty much.  One day at a time.
A favor?
Yeah.
'63 Chevy.
I knew it.
What do you want?
No.
Maybe.
Why?
No.
They took over a club I was working at.  Caesar started managing it.
What was it then?
I think so, too.
Maybe he did.  He would brag to me all the time.  He was never afraid of Caesar because he didn't know him.  Not like I do.
I am, but ...
Do you think you know me like that?
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
Yeah, twice.
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
Fine.
Shit!  Oh shit!
If he does ...
I think we're going to find out.
Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
Pop?
Caesar, come here.  Sit.  We talk now.  You too, Johnnie.
Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge.  This is it.  He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
This doesn't go upstairs.
We don't know what we're into!
I know you've been trying to kill me.
So it's time to go home.
I don't think so.
Keep it. 
Jason...  They can't let you go...
MPG Capital.
Get the kids out!
You are a friend of his?
...we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened. When they came for his things, it was made known for us, you see?
Yes.
For twenty thousand dollars.
I don't want anything but a ride. All I want to do is go home.
What if I say no?
Nothing.  It's just not there.
Well, this is great.  I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns.
Jason...
You knew he was coming.
But the police --
I don't know. 
You could do that?
Yes.  That's who I want to be.

If you're lucky.  Take it.  There's enough in there to make a life.  Any life.  Just get out now. Get low.  Stay low.  <u>Take it</u>.
I'm gonna find the end of this.  I can't protect you.
-- don't sweat it, I have a pen -- no problem -- just let me find the page --  -- honey, why don't you wait for me outside, okay? --
You're in danger.  All of you.  I have no time to explain.
-- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- I told this to the case officer last week...  ...<u>here</u> -- Mr. Thomas.  I told Mr. Thomas I didn't know this guy was already married -- I admitted this!
You we're lost at sea.  They pulled you out.  Who are you?  You were shot -- two bullets -- in the back.  You understand me?  Who are you?
Machines don't fix themselves.
You're putting your talents to very odd use Mr Lowry - yes, odd use - to pit wits against Central Services -
We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.
Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
Jill Layton ...  You're a very good little girl. What are you doing here?
Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old fashioned virtues. They just can't stand seeing the other fellow win. If these people would just play the game, instead of standing on the touch line heckling -
- In fact, killing people - they'd get a lot more out of life.
Where's Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she?!
This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!
Quite, absolutely - I always thought they were false.
Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one. If you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense.
You killed him?
Yes. I'm impressed.
You're the only person I can trust.
Say it was a mistake.
You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
I do. Goodbye. 
Help me, Jack! I'm frightened!
Have you got an Arrest Receipt?
Well don't. You're looking at twenty pounds of high explosive! And if you don't stamp this form I'm going to blow the place up!
How can I act naturally, when you've trying to break my arm?
Who are you?
I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams!
I know you. I saw you through the floor, didn't I?
Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
Where are you taking me?
How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
No. Please. They're going to arrest you.
Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop! 
I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
Hang on.
You are good to me Sam.
Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! 
It's what you wanted isn't it?
I won't be held responsible.
{suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
Thank you for calling Cen -
I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.
Thank you, Dawson.
It's a 27B/6, what did you think it was?
Who fixed your ducts?
What is this?  Who the hell are you?
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
On the house. You did me a favor. Check the corridor.
You can trust me on this one.
Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
No!
I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
He's going to be all right, right?
IB Bangin.
It's not so rare. He grew up on our street. He's had a rough life and he's a little crazy from it, but that's no excuse for not giving someone a lousy cup of water.
That's what I told her. If she could just see him a second, then I could take her home.
He's dead, huh?
Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know.
You look so different.
You sure? I know my father would hate to be tied down. He wouldn't even go to the dentist.
Not as good as Nino's.
Five years.
Okay.
We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.
Don't be a cop. If you have any doubts about this, it's my fault.
He'll be all right.
No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.
He's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll try to bring him back.
What's wrong.
Backup?
It's coming.
I'll drink to that.
Here's to the greatest job in the world.
Who knows? It's all lower-brain-stem- activity. The heart refuses to stabilize--he's coded eleven times since he got here. This guy's a fighter. Every time the Valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints.
Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
No.
How can that be? He was getting better.
No prisoners. Don't worry, Frank, just a little psychological first aid.
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
I don't know--let's break some windows.
Okay, whatta I do?
Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
What?
No way!
You're almost there, you can do it -- can do -- can do.
Great.  Network news, Washington... I love it.  What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?
Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
We're conversing...Oh my, the names of the entire Cabinet has slipped my mind.  What are they?
Okay.
We sure do.  I don't mean it as a knock either.  Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think and you can disregard it if you want.
Your coat jacket is rising up in back.
The pointers were great.  I'll study the tape.
London.  That's a promotion!
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
You spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap...  Oh good.
We can cut back at the end.
I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...
Okay, great -- good luck.
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
I don't know.  I may be in love with him.
Yeah -- being a basket case.
Hi.  Will I ever sing again?
I'm going to take it.
In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
Yes, there is.
Let me hear it!
Yes, it's true.  They're going to make it public Wednesday but isn't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early?
Nobody else had it.
Oh.
No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
I could use somebody to talk to on a day like this.  Sorry. Go ahead.
I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
Proud?  I'm just embarrassed that I like when they say those things.
I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.
I like "godsend."
Okay.
Billion.
Okay, billion...right, of course. They told me I could have any producer I wanted -- and I want you.
Yes.  Just don't say anything mean for a while.  Thanks.
Excited.
I'm going over to Aaron's.  Maybe I'll hoop up with all of you later.  How long do you think you'll be there?
Jennifer, you want to have another drink?
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like to go.
I'd like to know.  I'll go along.
I'll see you at the office.  Good night.
Okay.  Good night.
That's more than 'yes' -- that's 'you bet.'
Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
It just proves that the difference we have are...
How come you're not chasing it down yourself?
I'm going home!
Um...
Well I just wanted to make sure you know, fully and completely, that you're never gonna get any from me, at least in this lifetime.
Not really.  One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.
Is the manager cooperating?
You can do anything you want if you set your mind to it.
Oh...
Sorry...
Oh sure, let's string along poor Walter, see how far it will take us!
Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal.
Is it?  I've forgotten.
Hm.
I'm totally serious!
I mean, screw them, you know?  I'm just gonna go right on creating 'cause it comes from here -  you know?
I think he's looking for you, man... it's all finally catching up with you!
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
I didn't buy it I made it.
Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.
Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
It was.
Listen to me...I don't want to lose this piece -
You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
Call me...Maxwell.
It would imply you could not succeed on your ability alone!
I thought you didn't respect money!
Oh no, I couldn't do that.  Mrs. Swicker would start asking questions. She's my landlady.
Gee.  Thanks.
Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
Noise Mrs. Swicker?  What noise?
I was just straightening up the place.
No... Not a boy...  Find out if they're dead.  And do something about that arm.  Honestly, I don't know how you made it through the Crusades.
That's it, man.  That's the whole story.
The sun!  It burns!  It burns!
Don't tread on the earth?
Jealous?
Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
'Bye.
So I noticed.
You left me a message?
Hi there.
Not exactly.
Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.
Besides, Oxnard sucks.
Merrick...
A dress.
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Benny was right.  You guys are all exactly the same.
Yeah, you look like you're having a swell time.
Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone.
We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch.
Well, where?
My birthright?  You mean, like a trust fund?
I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
China.
Cramps?
She --
All right.
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
Sporting events, yeah.
Here?
Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
Don't start with me again.
So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
It's what I was raised to do.  There aren't many of us left, the Watchers.
Watchers?
And it makes it worse when I die, right?
Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
Excuse me for not knowing about El Salvador.  Like I'm ever going to Spain anyway.  Ooh!
That's the plan.
How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to.
Ever since Adam and Eve first left the garden, he followed: the serpent. Satan.  He sends his legion in the shape of men, to feed on us, to breed his Hell on our earth.  They are a plague upon us.
Where'd you learn how to do that?
Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.
I gotta bail.  You coming?
Wit-tay.
Nice much.
Oh, please!  When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
You're so out of it.  You've blown off cheerleading, you've blown off dance committee --
He's handled a lotta pitchers whose records were better than one and six.
Just till I lose.
He did?
I'll be back when we lose.
Yeah, Skip, it's me.  Jeez...Jeez...God...Jeez...
How can I possibly thank you?
I got lured.
"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
Well, he fucks like he pitches. Sorta all over the place
We all deserve to wear white.
I don't dance.
Let me.
Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
Fact is you're afraid of meeting a guy like me 'cause It might be real so you sabotage it with some bullshit about commitment to a young boy you can boss around--  Great deal.  You get to write self- indulgent little poems all winter about how hard it is to find a man even though you just sent him packing-  So what do you really want?  You wanta be a tragic woman figure wallowing in the bullshit of magic?  Or do you want a guy?
Thurman Munson.  He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody--it was beautiful ...  And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition!  So I stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball.
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
That's not necessary, Jackson---  Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign.
Jesus, what kinda broad are you?
When you know how to make love, you'll know how to pitch.  Shh.  I love this part.
Who's he play for?
C'mon, God damn it, gimme some!
Did you call me a cocksucker?
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
You're outta here!
How?
You been in the Majors?
You're through with one night stands?!  What do you want?
Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you.
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
No.
My right.
If ya get in a fight with some asshole, never hit his with your pitching hand.  ya might get injured.  That's another lesson for ya--now quit fucking around and help me up.
Fear and ignorance.
The Crash Davis. ) And you, Larry Hockett, should recognize me 'cause five years ago in the Texas League when you were pitching for El Paso and I was hitting cleanup for Shreveport, you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game in bottom of the 8th and I tattooed it over the Goodyear Tire sign, beat you 4-3-- and I got a free wheel alignment from Goodyear.
'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.  The Big Club's got a hundred grand in him-
Hit me in the chest with this...
C'mon, Meat.  You can't hit me 'cause you're starting to think about it already, you're starting to think how embarrassing it'll be to miss, how all these people would laugh.  C'mon, Rook--show me that million dollar arm 'cause I'm getting a good idea about the five cent head--
I was thinking I could fly up and spend a week in the Big Leagues with you--help you get comfortable.
Better find our bonus baby, eh?
It's a league record.
I'm Joe Riggins.  Sit down
Eight and sixteen?!  How'd we ever win eight?  Jose, what's this sign?
I'm getting too old for this game.
Where does he go?
Don't tell him I told you--he'd break my neck.
It's like everything else in this place. You don't do it yourself, it never gets done.
Was I at that dinner?
It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.
I mean, Frank Marino was there to meet him, but so were the cops. This time they wanted to pinch him for some diamond burglary in Antwerp.
Hey!
You do? Yeah? Well, if you ever come back again... ever... to take her money... next time bring a pistol. That way you got a chance. Be a man, don't be a fuckin' pimp. Now, you want to do me a favor? Get out of here. I want to be alone with my wife. Get the fuck up and get out of here.
Mm-hm.  1862. Okay, good. I'll call you right b-
Well...
Mommy.
Oh, no, please, please.
I don't know.
Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything. What am I gonna do? I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.
And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.
To begin, I put money out on the streets, chargin' three points a week. You know - juice to the fuckin' dealers.
It was so obvious. I mean, all of Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were real signal happy.
Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about, huh? You know!  If you're actin' like this now, how can I depend on you?  There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way.
No, I don't wanna come -
I'll be honest with you.
That's all taken out of context. Okay.
I lost control?
...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!
Yeah.
Now, what does she have to do with all this?
Hey, she came to talk...
Yeah, that's right, the way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen and get you out of one of your jams. I'm gonna have to straighten out what you just did with this guy.
What people?
You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  They think you went batshit!
Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker, you. You only exist out here because of me!  That's the only reason!  Without me, you, personally, every fuckin' wiseguy skell [Skell: the lowest form of wiseguy - a drunken bum] around'll take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass! Then where you gonna go?!  You're fuckin' warned! Don't ever go over my fuckin' head again! You motherfucker, you!
Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker.
I'm gonna okay you ten and get you even, and that's it. Then you got to get out of here before the cops and the newspapers are all over you.
No, I'm not okay.
How'd you know I was here?
Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
Are, uh -  - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?
Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?
They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
I-I'm sorry, Sam.
No, Ace.
...and she doesn't always -
L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
The little guy. He's half in the bag, and nobody told him he was eighty- sixed from the joint, so we...
No, just - just give him, give him ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right down.
Who's this?
I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.
Uh-huh.
Yeah. Yeah.
Oh...
All this stuff doesn't mean anything. Money, this, doesn't mean anything without trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life.
No.
You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you?  Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?
Didn't. No, instead, what did he say? 'Fuck him. Take him for everything he's got.'
You didn't have to beat him up!
What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?
Right.
And...
Yeah.
At the most, which is impossible for him.
I'm just tryin' to figure it out.
You hate my guts? I want you to come with me now.
What did Jennifer have?
I was with somebody.
She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.
Listen to me.
Let me tell you something.  Listen to me.
I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay?
I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go.
I want you to let me go.
You make me sick, you fuck. Once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.
Bullshit! Bullshit!
Long suspected of running the Tangiers without...
Okay, I'll -
You've been very open with us. I mean, uh, your books and papers and... that - that's gonna mean something when you go before the Commission.
So, you're a righty?
...I got muscled on the street.
You shut up.
What expenses?
Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss.
Please.
Go get a bag, man.
Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
Bullshit, you're out of here, cowboy!
You've gotta be kidding me! 
Nicky, I did -
Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born.
Why, does it look like it's bothering me? What do I give a fuck?  Fuckin' Oscar too. All the fuckin' money I've given that prick, he don't even look over here. What's his problem?
Great!
We can't help him if -
Fine, fine.
He's good. He's fine.
I understand.
I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?
He could have killed him! Okay? He could have killed him.
Yeah.  Thanks.
'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
Yeah.
Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it.
What about my money?
Yes.
Okay?
It means I got the money.
You're done yakkin', okay? You're done yakkin' now?
All right.
I think that's it.
Come on, damn it. Don't get so defensive. It could be stuck in your hair, you know.
'Cause it clogs up your heart.
Stacy. 
Go fuck yourself.
And when I'm ready, I'll say the words, 'Go see the Jew.'
Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out!
Fuck you, you motherfuck!
This motherfucker, do you believe this? Two fuckin' days and nights!  Fuck me?
Yeah, I know, that's why you had it ready. You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?!
Your fuckin' head, huh? Don't fuck around, Tony.
...this, uh, this Commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application.
Denying?
Since when do you talk like that?
I'm sorry.
You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?
Having a good time?
You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
Uh, I have a plane to catch to Cleveland...  Can I get my winnings?
Ayy!  Some cat's blocking the periscope.  Somebody, give it a swat...
Adonis, be polite. She's a friend.
Oops--my face must match my cape. And to think we were going to let you go...
I don't know. I can't remember.
I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff."
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...Would you like to go to dinner? I know; a tame suggestion considering the wide variety of miniature golf possibilities available to the Oasisburg citizen--but nevertheless, would you?
Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
So, did you see "Seinfeld" last week? That Kramer-guy really makes me laugh.
We'll hunt him down together...
Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
My dog!
The "skylight?" Fool!  It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight...
That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
Do you have any idea how much superheroes get paid?  Zilcho. Urban vigilantes with secret identities operating outside the law. Not exactly the stuff of a W-2 form.  If it wasn't for merchandising and corruption and these diabolical "missions"...There is no such thing as heroes and villains, anymore, Selina.  There are only winners and losers. You lost. We won.
You can't get away with..
You know, my name's not Spooky. It's, it's Rachel.
Can I be frank, Frank?  Your entire existence is sexual harassment. I accept there's not much you can do about it.
Oh Frank, I'm not anti-male, I'm anti- you. Believe me, there's a difference.  Kelly is designing new uniforms for next week. Pay her and thank her. And is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning.  There's something out there called 73 degrees, look into it.
Uh. "Thanks?"
What is it with women and Catwoman? Men have the courtesy to punish the weak, but women love punishing the strong. Don't get me wrong--this Catwoman is a terrifying, subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. It's just, I like her a lot.
But of course you are.
Nothing. How's your hand?
Then there's you, Louis, sneaking through back alleys and surprise visiting me at my home..Both of you have been way too frisky from the get- go. I'm actually a pretty amazing person--funny, smart, attractive when I get my sleep--but you two had no way of knowing that-- when I met you both I was basically a morose, depressed amnesiac incapable of any human feeling. The only reason one of you wanted to go out with me is because you knew I was Catwoman.
Okay, deal.
Maybe.
I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same.
Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day..
Oh pooh, come now. If you turn me down, I just might throw a fit..you know how us girls can be..
I would appreciate a little space. Thank you.
Matter of fact I did have a kid once.  But he's a lot better off with his father in Milwaukee.
I'm sure he'll be heartbroken.
You could've made me lose my call.
This Mercedes of yours, what's it look like?
Then whose is it?
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
I got to get going.  An agent is showing me a house up on Broad Beach in ten minutes.
Can you make him stop!
And stop with the directions.
Allow me.
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
You're the one who's not to be believed.
Because you know you'll be killing us.
What makes you say that?
She would if she heard my voice on the phone.
A woman?
Well you did.
Don't say that.
They've still got to be able to sign his name.
God, if he doesn't come back --
I'm not leaving my daughter behind.  Not with them.
Can you walk?
She's a child.  She might panic. She doesn't know me.  She might not come to me.  She might just run.
All right.  Now that you explain it I see that you're right.
The rest of the money is here in the car.  Why don't you come and get it?
Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
I thought it was inspired.
He seems to think he's entitled to it all.
We might hit a bump and the gun might go off.  Ever see that Tarantino movie -- where Travolta blew that guy away in the back seat -- purely by accident?
Granted, the cops are not an alternative.  Certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk.
You, I would've noticed.
Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
Ask them.
You're the man with the gun.
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
Who is this?
I'm self employed.  What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
Fine.  I want half.  Plus the release of the family.
Sure.
We're waiting for the light to cross the highway.  It just changed.  We're in a grey van.  It reads "<u>Noble Carpet Cleaners</u>."
Then just wait.  I'm counting this all out and deducting my share. While I'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.  And her little girl.
Don't worry.
Better reassure him.
Okay Nels, you can always keep what you've got and haul ass leaving the lovely lady for me to worry about.  I'll bet she can be friendly when it's in her best interests.
The fuck I will!
There's two police cars now.
You want us to get ourselves killed?
Intelligent question, Nels.  I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
Take the 405 south.
Where do I turn?
Mind if I have a look?
How?
He gave me a look.
What do you think his name is?
An excellent quality.
No. Tell him to go fuck himself.
Fucking men, Col --
C'mon, babe! You know what I like... Easy!
You fucking did.
Please, Dil --
Fuck off back to Essex!
She's not a tart.
It's a simple question.
Guy I work with.
Don't know. Who is she?
Not me.
You know.
Must be in love to manage that.
Like you're concerned.
I am.
Did he dance with you?
What does that mean?
Yeah.
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
I'm superstitious. Drink.
Dil --
I have to talk to her, Col --
Probably.
A little.
Sorry.
Should have stayed a girl.
Don't.
Not here.
Why shouldn't I be jealous?
And you're not going to tell me more?
I can't.
I'm sorry.
Sorry. What you doing?
I will be.
Don't go like that.
You knew my Jody?
Whatever you say, Dil.
Then say it.
Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
You will, Dil
Thirty-five.
You know her, Jimmy?
Aha.
Can't.
Hasn't moved for twelve hours. Go on. Have a heart.
So you did fuck up.
Yes.
You're never out, Fergus.
Of course. I forgot.
Stay late at your work tomorrow night and I'll bring you the gear.
Yes?
I sincerely hope so.
So?
He described me down to a T. Knows what Jude looks like.
It's nothing. He's just got a sense of humor, that's all.
I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
What?
Request permission to guard the prisoner tonight --
Definitely unusual.
And who is she?
No fucking way.
Nope. Not handsome at all.
Could you?
They won't let him die.
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
My inside pocket.
Suppose you could say that.
Don't I know it.
Shut up, would you?
Yeah?
Having a pint in the Rock.
The best.
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
Me? No, I'm not good for much...
No.
Faster than cricket?
Who gives a fuck.
It's lovely.
Well -- come on.
Relax -- you're gaining.
You're going to look for him -- now?
I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
Don't be an idiot!
Don't be a fool! He's Carson Dyle!
Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --
His -- real -- ?
You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
Like I said, Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger. Remember what happened to Charles.
What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really.
No, what?
That's not Carson Dyle.
By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
Yes, I'm leaving now -- goodbye.
Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?
Well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then.
I didn't say anything. Will you give me those stamps?
I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that.
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
What are you doing?
Cutting it out.
Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?
Oh. I guess they just can't help it.
I'm sorry.
No, about Scobie, I mean. I can't think of any reason why he was killed.
This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
I dare you.
Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
Yes.
A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.
The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer.  Today it has a value of $100,000.  Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them.
You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur Félix -- are they for sale now?
I am a tradesman, Madame, not a doorman. And don't forget these.
And if it is?
Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.
Oh. Swiss. His profession?
I don't know.
I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
A letter? May I see it?
Did you?
It stands to reason you are telling the truth -- for why would you invent such a ridiculous story?
Up there! I would put it up there!
I found it! I found it!
A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
I don't know -- how would I know?
No, you see, I don't really love him.
Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
Shakespeare never said that.
Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
I'm sorry -- I heard the children laughing.
No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, avanti!
Lay on, MacDuff.
What was it?
What?
Do you tell lies?
I believe what he said.
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
Words can hurt very much.
But that is no reason to get a divorce!
The American Embassy.
Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
He was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning. He said he had never seen any like them.
I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
I never fucked Rod.
Don't flatter yourself. You'll be lucky to last ten seconds with me Ben.
I just wanted to check that you were okay?
You're grounded Friday night!
You said that two weeks ago.
Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone?
Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!
No honey.
No I wasn't.
Run!
No. I'll handle this.
Are you sure?
She's still a virgin.
A bullet to the right cerebellum.
Really?
Why?
Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.
I'm sure you should have failed.
You know about that too?
Then you should go.
Does she fuck?
There will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night.
No.
Especially not your dad.
Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?
Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?
So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.
Yeah. I think it's really sick.
Why?
Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
Sharon's far from a slut.
Quick! In the house. He won't look for us in there.
You can ask me anything.
Have you ever heard of someone named Lisa Sherman?
How could you?
You're not telling me something.
NO!
Kenny's aunt?
Just thinking about something.
There's going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday. It could be really dangerous for them if the killer isn't caught.
But you don't really mean it.
Maybe you better just drive me home.
I'm sorry, but you're not going to die a virgin Rod.
INT. ANDY'S ICE CREAM FACTORY/ANDY'S OFFICE - DAY.
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.

I need your truck.
Look, if I don't get this stuff to McGruder, it's goodbye, Andy's Ice Cream, goodbye, Jerome, goodbye, Mon-...
Yeah, I believe him.  He was my friend.
For cryin' out loud.
There we go.  There we go.  Did you keep it safe?  Did you 
What the hell is with you, dog?  He's the one with the damn gun.
Do you wanna give me a minute?
No, no, no.
...-er.
 Shut up.

...-cho and a hijack-...
 
It was owed to me.  You stole the damn...
Well, then, that means it's call...
You  snatch that  phone  from me one more time, I'm--
Hey!  Hey!  Andy's Ice Cream.

Eight and a half feet wide!  Weighs over five tons!
Hey, and what if we  don't make it?!
That's right.  Now,  move!
Oh, shit.
 Okay.

Come on, old...
Come on.
You okay?
 Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 
Yeah...

...man!
Okay.  Okay.
What?
Worth a try.
...stole the truck.
So I took his truck, yeah.
We were nationally  ranked.
We were celebrating right after the draft, going from bar to bar.  I was drivin'.
...hospital.
And  things sort of just went downhill from there.
...Long.  Somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis...
...shit.
Well, all the same.  If we get to Missoula, help me find a car.  I'd appreciate it.  Then...you can...
Split?  I wouldn't get ten...
...deal with this asshole.
...or my conscience.
You all right?
Are you all right?


What?
...they come!
What?

Can we get out on your end of the tunnel?
You know, we saved half a million people from a full-body peel.
Excuse me.  I got a bullet in my leg.
Always the negative...
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
You.
I'll handle this from here, sweet   Owes us a little restitution.
Thank you.
...face" crap you've been telling me?
I was not in the man's face.  I was nego-...
Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Don't be tedious, waiter.  Dr. Long called it Elvis.
...frozen!  So if you don't mind--!

Vaughn.
It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five.
I ain't got time to argue with you today, Andy.  But I can tell you this.  Takin' your truck pissed you off?
Hold it!
What the hell is all this about a detonation today?  We're scheduled...
...to be off the island tonight.
And I changed the schedule.
Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
...you were right, of course.  But after...
Went away? 
I can't say it's a surprise.
And I certainly can't say it's pleasant.
And I don't like deviations from plans, Leo, as I'm sure you re-...
...maybe even Salt Lake, not to mention Casper...
Knowing you, Brynner, you've got buyers waiting to buy! You're not gonna use that...

The print's pretty fine. I forgot my glasses. I'd like to be able to read across.
It's why you attract a client like my daughter.
Do you know him?
Oh yes.
Yeah.
My daughter.
I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves.
Where is she?
An obituary column... can you read in this light?
That's all taken care of. You see, Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.
Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
Who do you blame for that? Her?
What are you talking about?
Thanks. You know something, Jake?
You bet your ass you don't. You can't even pay me off.
Forget it. I only mention it to illustrate a point...
In the garage.
Okay.
That's a filthy habit.
The apple core club.
You're welcome to try. There he is.
You mean that's what you're going to call it.
Let me show you something.
I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home.
C'mon I'll show you.
Too late for what?
No, Gittes, you'll show us.
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
Well, let's go.
Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
Mrs. Mulwray, do you happen to know the name of the young woman in question?
But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.
Anyway... I... the point is, Mrs. Mulwray.  I'm not in business to be loved, but I am in business, and believe me, whoever set up your husband, set me up. L.A.'s a small town, people talk.
Well I wouldn't run home and tell him whenever I went to bed with someone, if that's what you mean.
I don't believe you.
Never forgave him for what?
Of course I'm sure.
The Valley?
No.
Two weeks ago he bought those 25,000 acres. That's unusual.
Get in the car.
Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.
...No. Why was it.
Could you do anything about it?
Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
I know.
I saw him.
You didn't tell me.
Where's the girl?
Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
What are you saying?
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
Who is she? And don't give me that crap about it being your sister. You don't have a sister.
You can't go by train. Escobar'll be looking for you everywhere.
But, Mr. Gittes.
Sophie.
Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
'Those people?' Miss Sessions.
Who?
Do you accept anyone of the Jewish persuasion?
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose?
Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will. Dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought.  That's news.
That's like saying they're in Arizona.
Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
Didn't you talk to a man here... few days ago... wore glasses... he...
Of course not.
Gittes.
Yes.
Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display.
Let me explain something to you, Walsh. This business requires a certain finesse.
When I find out who that phony bitch was.
Mortgage Department, First National Bank.
Neither do I.
No, you have a press agent do it.
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
You don't say?
I bought a ticket. I've come to see the film. 
OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
You were expecting her? Huh?  ...It's a nasty business waiting by yourself. In company it's better. No?...Then I'll leave.
They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?
Toto, sooner or later there comes a time when talking or keeping quiet is the same thing. So it's better to shut up.  It's hot in here. Toto, take me to the beach.
It was probably meant to be like this. Each of us has a star to follow. So now what are you thinking of doing?
Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed.  When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that the case?...You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born...But not now, it's impossible. Now you're blinder than I am. 
Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh? 
Elena. My name's Elena.
Hi. Why are you running?
Sssssh, Be quiet, pretend everything's normal. I'm Salvatore.
The army says that, as a war orphan, I don't have to serve in the military, but nothing can be done. It's a bureaucratic error. I have to leave. Day after tomorrow morning. They're sending me to Rome. But they'll discharge me ten days later. Let's go...
Nor have I. Even though you disappeared...  But what's the point of talking about it? We risk being pathetic and ridiculous.  You still live in Rome?
Somebody stole it.
So what's that got to do with it?
The food is marvelous in Cuba the senoritas are beautiful stop I could send you prose poems of palm trees and sunrises and tropical colors blending in far off landscapes but don't feel right in spending your money for this stop there's no war in Cuba regards Wheeler.
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
Get me a typewriter.  I'll finish the notice.
You don't really think so?
Enthusiastic?
Susie?  I called her myself the day after he died.  I thought maybe somebody ought to...  She couldn't even come to the 'phone.
Oh, yes.  He saw to that.  I tell you, Mr. Thompson, he was a hard man to figure out.  He had that funny sense of humor.  And then, too, maybe he thought by finishing that piece he could show Leland he was an honest man. You see, Leland didn't think so.  I guess he showed him all right.  He's a nice fellow, but he's a dreamer.  They were always together in those early days when we just started the Enquirer.
Just old age.  It's the only disease, Mr. Thompson, you don't look forward to being cured of.  You ought to see Mr. Leland.  There's a whole lot of things he could tell you - if he wanted to.
Charlie?!
You just made the paper over four times today, Mr. Kane.  That's all -
That looks pretty nice.
Certainly not.
I'm all right, Mr. Leland.  Only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me.  I learned 'em! Didn't I, officer?
Not to me.  But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
Are they standing for me?
No, Mr. Kane.
We haven't heard from him.
I'm surprised he got the votes he did.
Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him.  And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.
No, it can't.  Good night, darling.
I don't see what else you can do, Charles.  If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has -
Go on!  Get out!  I can fight this thing all alone!
Toothache.
I've got a brush in the closet.  As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off.
Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you?  I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that -
You really don't know who I am?
But you like me, don't you?  Even though you don't know who I am?
Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like.
Well, I -
Oh, no, that's all gone.
It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.
Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!
Yes.
I'm going to be elected governor. And the first thing I'm going to do -
Where'm I going?
All right.
It's a wall you bought in China, Mr. Kane.
Charlie -
Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks -  Nobody can blame me because -
You might have made the whole thing less personal!
That's all right.  What are you going to do about Emily?
It's simpler than that, Brad.  A society girl can't stand the gaff, that's all.  Other things are important to her - social position, what they're saying on the front porches at Southampton, is it going to be embarrassing to meet somebody or the other at dinner -
Hey, Brad!  I've been analyzed an awful lot tonight - let's have another brandy.
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. 
It was for twenty-five thousand dollars.
Rogers isn't even pretending.  He isn't just scared anymore.  He's sick.  Frank Norris told me last night he hasn't known Rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years.
That's the train with all the lights.
Maybe you could remember something that -
They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
Yeah, but not in here.
You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
Exactly.
You're kidding.
No, don't!
I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.
No, you're not really getting married?
And you came here to what? To comfort me?
If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
He's your fiancé.
I'm just kidding.
Like what?
Was it you?
No.
Call the police.
Well, I don't know if sorry can make up for it. I found your remarks highly offensive.
In a second!
How 'bout covering point!? You suck!
Yes.
If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one.
I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
We get... what... twelve minutes of game, and it's over? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!!  I'm not even supposed to be here today!
I wanted to use your car.
I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone.
All four?
Compliments of Lando Calrissian.
Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right.
Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.
Basically.
All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
It's not like you laid the eggs yourself.
The jizz-mopper's job is to clean up the booths afterward, because practically everybody shoots a load against the window, and I don't know if you know or not, but cum leaves streaks if you don't clean it right away.
I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
Which ones?
Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin...
Yes, you do. You always back down. You assume blame that isn't yours, you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off, you buckle like a belt.
See? There you go again.
I'm gonna go to her wake.
No, you're not.
It's today.
Shit. What about tomorrow?
You hardly knew her!
You hate people.
Exactly, which means I can't close it for another hour so we can both go to a wake.
How'd he die?
I swear.
Balls resting on his lips.
He made it, hunhh?
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
Why should I loan you my car?
I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.
It's going to have to do for now, considering that it's my car that's up for request.  Can I help you?
Exactly.
If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. But I did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Hence, even though I'm a clerk in this video store, I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice.  Agreed?
Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
You're lying.
In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.
I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.
Fuck you.
My life is in the shitter right about now, so if you don't mind, I'd like to stew a bit.
What are you talking about?
Am I right or what?
Jesus.
What don't you do?  Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
What time did you get to work today?
Got one. Just pulled up.
I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica.
Do you need a hug or something? 'Cause I would have no hang-ups about hugging you... you know, you being a guy and all. Just don't knead my ass when you do it.
You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
Jesus Christ, what next?
Excuse me?
How much can you bench?
Yeah.
Hey man, that was a long time ago. Don't let it get to you.
Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
The difference is you exploit a weakness.
You used to go out with her?
We were going to start again, I think.
No; he was probably just resting his eyes.
Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would you mind if I took a roll of the soft stuff back there. I see you sell the soft stuff.
Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference? You said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough.
I'm not even supposed to be here today!
I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.
She called you, didn't she?
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
Why? You wanna have sex or something?
And I actually date you?
How many girls have you slept with?
We might have; I don't remember. How many?
Including you; yes.
Three.
We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around.
Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...
Dante...
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
Lower your voice!
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
Because going down it's a big deal! I used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later I'd go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved.
What time do you get finished?
It was only a few times...
I don't want Caitlin...
They oughta put some kind of warning on these cans, like they do with cigarettes.
What's this?
My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy.
Shit!  Don't take this the wrong way, but I used to fuck her.
Oh yeah. You were the built older guy with the black Trans and the big...
Well, how about these two movies? 
Which one?
Dental School.
I have first dibs.
Says who?
That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
Cursin'.  That's a penalty kick for unsportsmanlike conduct, mate.
If you can't make it back, I'll hold up at the Douglas Shaft. Stop worryin'.  You sound like a mother hen.
A monkey?
Copy.  Jessie, go to the top of Bitker ladder.
You're getting warmer!
Well you were wrong! It was your weight on the line that did it--
What the hell do you know about bad time.  You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family.
If you want, do it.  I don't care.
Not on that leg.
You keep it.  Get up there if you can, and if you get a chance, do me a favor and kill him.
I'm sorry for all the trouble... Thank you.
Wait, I think I have them sighted.  What's the word, Frank?
Don't say that.  You'll embarrass Frank.
The ledge, I know it well, or should I say <u>we</u> know it well.
Working...I'm trying to figure out where to start.
You couldn't.
Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
Where?
That's no good. It'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. If they show, they'll take you too.  Why'd you have to come up here?!
Remember the first time we came up here?
A simple yes or no would have done.
Breathtaking.
No, not really.  Throw down a rope.
We gotta get out and fire a flare.  It's the only chance!
Never
There's no "we".  There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face.
Can't do it.  Now go back and get help!
And miss all of this peace and quiet?  Never, right Hal?
Good memory.  You must be great with numbers.
I burned it.
What the hell's going on?
No, he's close, and he's using our money to keep you alive. Nobody's worth that much on the open market.  Except you, the loyal one.  Didn't I tell you to warm the place up?
Copy.  Hal, tell Gabe he only makes advances <u>to me</u> or else he'll be walking down four thousand feet, and sleeping outside.
Acknowledge.  Winds are too strong to get a chopper up there, Are you near any natural shelter? Over.
<u>Negative</u>.  The winds are too high.  I'm going to ride out the storm here.  I'll take shelter in the Douglas Exhibition Shaft. Over and out.
I just don't get this all. It was them that went for me, brothers. You're not on their side and can't be. You can't be Dim. It was someone we fillied with back in the old days... Trying to get his own malenky bit of revenge after all this time. You remember, Dim?
Great, sir. Great.
Our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not, shall we say, satisfactory, yes?
No! No! Don't touch it. That's a very important work of art. What the bloody hell do you want?
How do you do, sir?
What would you like to know, sir?
Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I'll try to sleep it off... then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.
Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?
That's just worries me. A bit too long to long to be reasonable. You're about due now by my reckoning, that's why I'm warning you, little Alex, to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt. Do I make myself clear?
It's alright, thank you.
Let's hope you make the most of it, my boy.
Fine. Absolutely fine. You see, Ladies and Gentlemen our subject is, you see, impelled towards good by paradoxically being impelled toward evil. The intention to act violently is accompanied by strong feelings of physical distress. To counter these, the subject has to switch to a diametrically opposed attitude. Any questions? Priest rises and moves to Alex.
Hi, hi, hi there, my little droogies.
One I think you will like... as a, how shall I put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. An understanding between two friends.
You wanna get up? Well, you've gotta you see... well I want you to lick it. Go on... Lick it. Alex, gagging and coughing, licks the sole of his shoe.
No, sir.
No, sir.
Right. Halt the prisoner. Good morning, sir, I'm Chief Officer Barnes. I've got 655321 on a transfer from Parkmoor to the Ludovico Centre, sir!
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.
What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?
Something like that.
I just don't understand about feeling sick the way I did. I never used to feel sick before. I used to feel like the very opposite. I mean, doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow. I just don't understand why, how what.
Yes?
Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.
And when do I get out of here then?
Can you... can you spare some cutter, me brothers? Alex rams his stick into the Tramp's stomach. The boys laugh.
That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father. I only know I want to be good.
Now then. Face the wall. Bend over and touch your toes. Chief Guard inspects Alex's anus with a penlight.
It says that you are willing to have the residue of your sentence commuted to the Ludovico treatment. Alex signs. Governor gathers up papers. Alex dots the last "i" and smiles.
Are you feeling better?
I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
Thank you.
What?
The ride is free.
There were two of us.  I had the other guy killed.  Don't need the competition...
He doesn't know you're up there!  Just stay right where you are!  Call the police!
This vehicle's not safe to drive. We're gonna have to impound it.  Get you towed.  Step away from the vehicle and pop the trunk.  I'm sorry, sir, you'll have to find another cab.
Save me the grief.  Step out of the car, sir, and open the trunk.
Jesus...
Oh, my, yes.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
The fat man on Cherry Street.  The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer.  The trumpet player.  That leaves two.
They found him dead in his own cab down by the Port Authority.
Detective Sergeant Phil Heller.
I brought you flowers.
You're gonna cheer up.
Yo, whassup?
<u>My hands are taped to the fucking </u> <u>steering wheel!</u>
We're gay lovers, what's it to you?
Max!  Dammit!  <u>Answer!</u>
I give a shit whose fault it was, you're payin'!
...well, last I checked, you were <u>sleeping</u> with me, so unless you wanna start fucking the guy soon, I'd suggest an attitude shift...
Twenty-four minutes.
I'm trying...
How about the thingy next to it?
The thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor...
You said you were visiting friends!
You're a cabby.  Like talk yourself out of a ticket?
Because I have a gun and I say so.
It was an accident.  I'm not liable.
So what?
No you don't.
Collateral damage.
Am I collateral?
I'm...what?  Sorry?
Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...
Don't even think you're walking away from me.
<u>I don't wanna know you!</u>
I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
What difference does it make?
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
It's not bullshit.
Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?
You're gonna be me.  You're gonna go in, and you're gonna get the info on the remaining two hits.
It's not what you owe <u>me.</u> Time is so fleeting.  One day it's gone.  You make it out of this alive, Max, you really should call her.  That's what I think.
That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
What's at Union Station?
...pie in the sky?  "Someday my dream'll come..."  But one night you'll wake up and realize suddenly you're old.  It hasn't happened.  It never will.  Life just flipped on you.  Tomorrow became yesterday.  Then you'll bullshit yourself it was never gonna happen, anyway, and push it back in memory...and anesthetize yourself in a Barcalounger with daytime TV for the rest of your life...  Don't talk to me about murder.  You're <u>do-in</u>' yourself...in this yellow prison with steel-belted radials. Clocking in and out everyday...
Excuse me?
Aren't you listening, man?  Love gives you wings.
You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
Sure was.  Pounded the V.C. for this Greek cat named Ari Onasis.
No.
Love.
I have no idea.
Who?
Who are you, Jerry?
I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?
Where'd you get your subscribers?
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
Murdered?
I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
What?
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
Where are we going, Jerry?
You go.  Send me a postcard.
No...!  But they trained me to. M.K. ULTRA.  EX-CATCHER.  America works.  Get rid of the crazy people, the lone gunmen, and the system still works.
Then tell me what happened.
Without a love of my own.
I can't promise you anything.
You think it's a conspiracy?
Now she tells me.
Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
<u>Liza</u>!
You've never seen her run.
Then I can't be hurt anymore.
I'm not sure what you mean.
A dog bit it.
You've asked me that one three times.
That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.
M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed.  EX CATCHER.
I am impressed.  We used the distinctive cover as a sort of mental flash card.
If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
I want this box rigged with a beacon!
Night after that?
I'm not that good at 'no,' Liza.
It's his show for now.  Look, you want to get some dinner?  Inter- Agency cooperation and all?
Nothing.  I was just making sure. So, who are you?
Ellie?
There's no plug to pull.
Dr. Arroway, let me first say --
Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.
'President's Science Advisor' -- so what, you just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now...?
It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now.
It was a worthy experiment -- worthy of you; I was wrong about that part. But it's over now.
You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...
Do you have a minute -- ?
I don't understand.
Right.  Well.
It could be anything.  The first volume of some Encyclopedia Galactica...
I don't know.  Maybe there is a fourth layer in there somewhere, but if there is, I sure as hell can't find it.
VB10's an M dwarf; Signa Draconis... too old.
NORAD's not tracking any spacecraft in our vector including snoops; shuttle Endeavor's in sleep mode.
But what do I say?
Could we hear to the moon?
Many others.
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
You have your mother's hands...  There are no tests, Ellie.  We don't sit in judgment.  Think of us more as... librarians.  Curators of the Universe's rarest and most valuable creation...
Can you help us?
But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
That would seem to be the question of the hour.  I want to build it, Doctor.  Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
Oh, not quite yet.  At least for their sake...  ... I hope it's not.  Because they're running out of time.
That's what they all say.
They can't.  I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
Any luck on the grant money?
Thirty-one linked dishes.  You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.
I'm -- I'm fine.
But the machine worked -- that's what I've been trying to tell everyone!  The tape -- it's all there, if they'd just look at...  ... the tape...
Very smooth.  It's Palmer, right? Where I came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards.  Really though... the Bible describes a God who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old.  I look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars... I mean burn me for a heretic, but your God seems awfully small.
I had... an experience.  Of belonging.  Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.
And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent.  But this experience went beyond both.  For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with.
Do you love your parents?
It's late.  We should go back.
The final countdown.
I can't do this --
Do you really think your life is meaningless, Eleanor?  Is that why you're so quick to risk it -- because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose?
Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
I'm not sure it's come to that.
I don't have any proof, Palmer.
I want to, Palmer -- more than anything.  But it has to be real. It has to be true.
In other words, God works in mysterious ways...
Meaning...
Y'know what?  Fine.  I guess if we want them to know the truth about who we are there's no quicker way to show them.
That's it, Mike.  Last time I checked, I was still running the country.  Although it seems that for the moment, Dr. Arroway is running the planet.
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?
Yeah, would of been nice to of knowed him, the way you talk about him.
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
She took off with that convertible feller...
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
Oh lean over here, lady. Lean this way.
Yeah. Come on out, Luke.
It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
Well, you got yourself some time now. Two years. Hell, that ain't much, we got coupla men here doin' twenty spots. We got one who's got all of it. We got all kinds and you gonna fit in real good. Course in case you git rabbit in your blood and decide to take off fer home, you git a bonus a some time and couple leg chains to keep you slowed down a little -- fer your own good. You'll learn the rules. It's all up to you. I can be a good guy or I can be one mean son-of-a-bitch, it's up to you.
What for?
Well, you know. Small town, not much to do in the evenings. Mostly it was settling up old scores.
I thought you knew, boy... they sentenced me by the mile.
But damn if he don't look like a fat old Dragline.
Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
Like an elephant.
He's the champeen hog-gut of this camp. Hell, I seen him eat ten choc'lat bars and seven cold drinks in fifteen minutes. He kin eat busted bottles and rusty nails, any damn thing. If you'd so kindly oblige as to let me cut off your yankee head, he'd even eat that.
Bears gonna be walkin' the road today.
Kick a buck.
A phoney? Whatta you mean, a phoney?
You can't expect him to learn everything the first day. Hopefully it's taught him a very valuable lesson.
How about you tryin' to make me?
But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
When was the last time you washed your hair?
But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.
Get out!  All of you!
Oh, God, uniforms, more stress. Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark.  We know, don't we, Princess?  Give her a couple of hours.  I know about this.
You get me out first.
What day is this?  In jail you lose track.  This week.  Friday.
I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
What book?
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it.  Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten.
Damn!  I gave that to Conrad, too! That guy!  I told Conrad deliver to Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in return for getting my book to you.
You know I can't do that.
I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...
You know where.
No.  Not yet.
Would you want to work with us on this?
I sent Andy out on murder missions. For God's sake -- it's the Boston Strangler, Alber deSalvo.  He used their own stockings to strangle them.  Tied in a bow-knot.
Work with me.
Then what do you need me for?
You're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style?  That doesn't happen.  These men are robotic; the murder is like a ritual.  The method itself is part of the pleasure...
Hello, Ruben...  So that's that...
I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows...
It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims.
He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
What I can't believe is that in an earlier life I slept with him! Christ!  Any God that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button.  Just give me a minute here.  The letter is addressed to me...  You don't feel fear, do you? You're young.  You feel like you'll live forever.  How wonderful.
He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape.
MaryJane.  You think that logic and police procedure, order and science and method will hold back the horrors of a world gone mad and the sickness of the night.  I did once. But you know how he'll get caught? He'll have an accident, or some cop will get lucky.  You can't catch him by being intelligent and working hard.  Or the worst:  there are dozens of women slaughtered in the most horrible way, month after month.  The news stories grow more grotesque and bizarre and in the city people lock their doors and windows, and hurry home before dark.  And then, one day, there are no more.  What happened?  Did he just stop?  Get tired and disgusted and decide not to kill any more? Did he kill himself?  Did he die in an auto accident?  Or a fight.  Or get sick and die?  It's like the murderer walked off the edge of the earth.  And you never know.  But you keep asking yourself -- when you read about a new murder -- is he back?
No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.
Listen to me.  Is there a gas station nearby?
Is there a phone booth there?
They all have one...
We know Helen.  She's not exactly a credible collaborator.  Especially late in the day...
I'm over here?  What's your name, Officer?
Yeah, you did that too.  You earned what you got; don't shit on it, that's all I'm saying.
Don't ever forget how good you are.
It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody.
Talk to Nikko...!
Am I in charge of this thing?  Or not.
What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?
"Spokes<u>person</u>."
Don't give me six years!  You never divorced Patty, did you?  So what'd you expect from M.J.?
You know I don't like to watch talk shows by myself.  Where're you?
In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.
No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
I'll listen for you buzzing over.
After being bombarded endlessly by road- safety propaganda, it's almost a relief to have found myself in-an actual accident.
I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.
I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.
Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy.
Really? What kind of exhibition is it?
It's not the police. It's the Department of Transport. Internal politics. It's a joke. They have no idea who we really are
No, I mean a crash with a history. Camus' Facel Vega, or Nathaniel Nest's station wagon, Grace Kelly's Rover 3500. Fix it just enough to get it rolling. Don't clean it, don't touch anything else.
Where are you?
Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
I want to see my mother immediately.
All I want you to do is think about what's best for you. Really think about it.
OK, good. That's good. Thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off.
I have a going-away gesture for you, too.
Do you think I should?
I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
But what am I going to do?
Will you get time off to do that?
Mom, please.
Especially with a promotion in the offing.
Can I get you a glass of champagne?
Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.
You too, Mom.
Not even if it's something positive?
I'm glad.
Terrific.
Enough with the abracadabra.
I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
Do you?
First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?
Open up.    I want to see.
You like it?
It's sex time.
No.
I think I should go home.
Bingo.
When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
Michael, take it easy.
It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
No, it's not like that.
Come on, Letty.   It'll get done.
So, I've been thinking a lot...
I just wish we'd done it sooner.
It doesn't matter who.
I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
I'll float you.
Wired?    I ain't wired.
Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's why you're here.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
What?   This?
I swear man, I don't know. They packed up and left a half hour ago.  All I got is one of their phone numbers in Paris.
Vincent's in the States on business.  That it?
I don't trust anyone. You don't get to the top of this game by trusting people... and after all, you are a thief. It's in your nature to steal. I'm just protecting my investment.
-- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back.
Well, you better get the money somehow. Six o'clock and come alone. If you don't we'll destroy the tapes.
Okay.   How much?
I'm not here to negotiate.
And the other half?
I know they won't be home tonight.
I'm not any closer than you are.
Jesus!
You want Zero to kill him?
And the Vodka.
And be careful when you get near the top. Zero has a very long one.
We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
That's Frankie Zammito.   The Under boss of the Chicago Mafia.
Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
-- Did you set it up?
We had a deal.
Boy, you must be pissed.
Well, I must say you're handling it very well.
Good song though.
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
Yes.
Okay.    I will have a beer.
C'mon, get real, will you. You think he's just going to forget about this? These guys are all about respect. All about honor. He's coming after us, so we might as well take the money.
Yeah, but you did do it.   So let's deal with that.
God, I want to go home.
I don't know what you're talking about.
No thank you.
I know where she went.
Cool.
Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us.
J&amp;B?
Thanks.
Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed?
No.
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
Yes.
Pardon me, but I doubt you can handle her.  My wife was quite a martial arts expert.  Jade Fox killed her.  So you see, this is personal.  Leave her to me.
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
Long.
I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you want to change into them?
I heard you met Shu Lien today.
I have a guest.
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.  Our feelings for each other grew stronger.  But how could we dishonor Meng's memory?  So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.  But I have never tasted it.
I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage.
Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.  If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice.  You can run from marriage, but not your parents.
Go back to them first.  Then you can decide about Lo.
Jen!
Still in a bad mood?  At least you're speaking.  What's your name?
Don't ever come back.
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
It was Bo, Sir Te's man.  I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.
But your men are watching over Yu's compund?
That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword.
Well, we had talked...
Father!
What does it say?
What do you have in mind?
Thanks, babe.
Right.  You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward?
Leave here.  Don't do this.  I don't want you here.
You're bleeding, man.  You can't make it.
I dabble.  May I?
Who?
A remembrance.  A closure.
You're not gonna come back, are you?
You mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave?  Euww.
I don't know you.
It's yesterday!  Do you know what you destroyed?
I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
I don't believe that. Lao motions to Grange with the killing blade.  Grange RELAXES his deathgrip on the crow.  MOVE IN CLOSE on Eric so we may perceive a palpable degree of relief.
Miss her?
Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
Very well, it's your ass.
Kill a dead guy?
I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The "hit".
You what?
You didn't show it to anybody?
From who?
Now it's my job to look out for you. You're like a kid sister to me. Do I look like some kind of gossip queen?
Got a boyfriend back home?
No.
Why are you being so dramatic?
Please.
You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
I never said that.
Thank you.
Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you.  You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.
I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
I said I was sorry.
Don't you believe in love at first sight?
That's none of your business.
I'm busy.
Yes.
I'm... I'm alright.
Reading.
Of Human Bondage.
What?
You must take me for a real idiot.
I am lighten. Can we drop this?
No.
That's not fair.
Yes.
It's because I don't trust myself with you.  I took a vow and because of you I'm tempted to break it. Don't destroy that for me. Please.
I think that's for the best.
Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
Why aren't you understanding?
I know. I wish I felt the same. Unfortunately, I feel nothing. I think it was just the conquest. Sorry, I'm completely fucked up.
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
I don't think that bothered him.
I'll see you tomorrow.
You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do?
Eyes closed.
No.
Best friends.
Something awful happened last night.
I... I don't think you want to know.
Well... I don't know - it was weird. At first it felt icky, then it felt kind of okay. Then, I started getting really hot and then I started shaking and then like, I don't t know... it felt like an explosion, but a good one.
You think he'll like it?
But -
Prude.
I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
Your career? What about your family? Can you imagine the humiliation your father's going to feel when he finds out his pride and joy is a fudge- packer.
Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded?
Pretty sure or sure sure?
I'll be right there.
I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
I see your point... though why should I care?
I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
I'll think about it...
No.
Cecile.
What is that? Oh my God, it's your conscience.
Jesus, she reeks of Laura Ashley.  Oh, she's crying. Wittle baby's upset by the big bad book.
What's your problem?
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
It clearly is why.
Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet.
I've never done this before.
I think you have your answer.
War it is.
Ronald? That's crazy.
Black.
Is that so?
You must be Sebastian. I've heard such nice things about you.
I've already told you, she's not home.
It's really important.
Oh... no thank you...
I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.
Can we do it later. I've had a really bad night and -
That's exactly what I told Mr. Reed, but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you, Miss Callahan.
Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
It's been ages since I've even thought of a mummers' play. When I was in college we used to do them every year — St. George and the Dragon, all kinds of sword dances.
I can see it all...the very day it began. Amy was lonely; she was desperate for friendship. I remember the night she told me she had wished on her ring. That must have been the day she first wished for a friend.
She was very pretty.
All right, Amy.  Go tell Edward to take you.
I'm sure I don't, Alice.  It's something else -- something moody -- something sickly --  She could almost be Irena's child.
It's early yet.
I'm not shouting at you, but there's no doubt in my mind that you spoil this child!
Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
But I didn't play with them, Daddy.  They wouldn't play with me.
Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories — I'm sick of this sort of thing.
Yes, darling.
But where is that?
I'll just never learn arithmetic.
Yes, yes! I see Prince,
Oh, please!
It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
Don't cry, Amy.
Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.
Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.
But what happened to the little deer?
But I only came to give back the ring.
Then I'll tell you a story — a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
My little girl said she'd kill you if you came to see me. I can't let you die. We'll have to hide you.
Yes, Barbara... Barbara...
Such a brief visit, but dear child, it has made my Christmas very merry.
Yes, everything's all right, Edward.
Good heavens! What could you be giving me. Little Miss?
No. Amy slapped Donald because he had hurt the butterfly -- and it was her friend.
That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
Can we get some service here?
Yeah that's like a three bagger. Today a bag is also a condom, so now a three bagger can be a chick that's really hot. So hot you gotta put several condoms on to dull the senses.
No, it was another woman.
Anything's better than Mark.
Your shrink always gives you bad advice. He only hears what you choose to tell him. Mark's an asshole, he cheated, he borrowed money and never paid it back, he's never had a regular job.
Sorry. It's just so bad lately. You're so lucky you never get PMS.
Only to see.
And she got the medium.
What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite, the old standby, "I have to use your bathroom."
And he was ripped limb from limb?
I'm sure they were exaggerating.
I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
Rule one: always wear make-up.
I don't know much about him. How do you know if a guy is decent?
What the hell is the tampon test?
I think he called you beautiful.
It is so hot in here.
I still thought it was a purse.
There is a man's arm in my bed.
Because of PMS, I get hairy, my nails turn into claws, I eat raw meat, I roam the city hunting for flesh. I've become a werewolf!
Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
What? Why'd you do that?
You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
Ignore it.
Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.
"The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." See I knew you never loved Mark.
So what do I do?
I guess you'll find out.
So you're Grant's secretary?
Knock what off?
I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.
I can't help it, it smells so good.
These guys aren't the kind that'll take an apology. They're the kind that'll break my thumbs.
On your desk.
Intriguing?
Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
Like what?
A lot of people don't wear underwear.
Goodnight.
Okay, you busted me.
It wasn't a date. Jennifer invited me along to dinner with them.
Yeah, every guy you date winds up dead.
This is a lot worse than "Betty."
Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
What about... those guys... I might have...
I don't know. I don't remember doing it.
No, I have a cat.
Packages of money.
You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
Take some allergy medicine.
He's been running money for the Mafia.
Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess.
She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
The park dude was missing an arm.
I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
The city.  I need to get to the ocean.
The other one?
His wife.
How will we interrogate them?
Shut up!  Everybody stay calm...
Really?  And how is his state of mind?
That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
I'm afraid so.
Good.
I woke up in a subway.  I don't know how I got there.
No.  Have a look.
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water.
Well...
Not exactly.  She was found in a canal, disembowelled.  Throat cut. Blood drained.  The body wrapped in a bed-sheet.
So you're telling me the truth <u>this</u> time?  Is that it!
No more than the usual.
`Thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
I'm the President and as they say 'The buck stops here.'  So I take full responsibility for every one of my illegal acts.
I don't give a shit.
Fine.
Remember that First Liberty stuff we almost got nailed on?
Couple of days.  Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...
I'm telling you, Bob,  it's a gift. When you got a Ferrari you don't leave it in the garage.
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
He's only doing what you told him to.
What I told him to?
Just what you think I mean.
Dave -- I'm working.
I'm not surprised.  Can we save anywhere?
That'd be great.
Really?   Crazy?
We vetoed that?
You're not?
What?
On occasion for security purposes, to double for the President at the Secret Service hires someone public functions and exposed situations.
You got a gun?
Of course.
You're kidding.
Go tuck yourself, Bill.
Yeah.  I'm sure it's keeping you up nights.
Oh, come on, Bill.  Don't patronize me.   I'm not one of your little...  Turn around.  I'm talking to you!... Turnaround!
Oh... Yeah.
I don't mind.
Just wait.
Yes.
Oh... I lived with a President.  It isn't any fun.
We're working on it.
All set.
Fabulous.
I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland?
Then why did you come here?
Let's just....wait a minute. Get a better look.
Come on.
Listen, Missy. I am the only due process that has ta be served aroun' tyere and one of the people doin' the servin' from now on is gonna be you. Now you been prancin' aroun' the Cave like yer ass was glass fer long enough! All that's
That sounds like a curse to me.
Forever, darlin'. Forever. 'Til he turns ta dust and blows away on the wind.
Look...I know you have no reason to trust me. I've got friends in the Cave. I got some stuff comin' out this mornin'. I'm gonna try to get off the island.
Come on. Let's go.
What you wanna do?
I tol' him. I tol' him this is a dead place. Like all the others.
They will never be satisfied with anything else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh. I'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they don't get mine! Not while I'm still using it!
Leave me alone, you...COCKSUCKER!!!
If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat.
Sir, Tyler is innocent of any crime against the State. Captain Rhodes is...
For the good of mankind. That's what every monster-maker says.
In the battle, sir.
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
Will do.
Knox Overstreet.
What is the point?
The point is she was thinking about me! I've only met her once and already she's thinking about me.  Damn it, it's gonna happen!  I feel it.  She's going to be mine!
This is it.
So avoid using the word 'very' because it's lazy.  A man is not very tired, he is exhausted.  Don't use very sad, use morose.  Language was invented for one reason, boys--to woo women--and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do.  It also won't do in your essays.
Sucking out the marrow doesn't mean getting the bone stuck in your throat, Charles.  You still have responsibilities to yourself and those who care about you.
Miss it?  It drives us crazy.  That's part of what this club is about.  In fact, I'd like to announce that I've published an article in the school paper, in the name of the Dead Poets society, demanding girls be admitted to Welton, so we can all stop beating off.
Maybe he'll have some advice.  Maybe he'll even talk to your father.
Ridgeway High.  How's Henley Hall, Gin?
Knox!  what are you doing here?
I don't care.  I love you, Chris.  You deserve better than Chet and I'm it. Please accept these.
Knox, why are you doing this to me?
You can't be in here.
God, if Chet found out he'd...
It's just for a little while. You promised.
That goes for all of you.  Now eat with your correct hands.
Meeks.
Seize the day while you're young, see that you make use of your time.  Why does the poet write these lines?
"We went to the woods because we wanted to suck all the marrow out of life." Anybody want to read?
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
Courtyard?
Boys marching.  Clapping in unison.
A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
Why do you do it?  I mean, with all this seize-the-day business, I'd have thought you'd be out seeing the world or something?
Are you kidding?  He'd kill me!
Isn't there an easier way?
You know what this means to your mother, don't you?
Good boy.  Call us if you need anything.
But different.
Well, you've won the booby prize.  Don't expect to like it here.
But why?  Don't you understand what Keating is saying?  Don't you want to do something about it?
So?
So I'm gonna act!  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.  Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
And now he will?
Neil, you're not gonna...
They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
All right, be cool, everybody, nice and slow, no sudden moves.
Boat or no boat...I'm going...
I don't know what these things are ...all I know is...
And where is our point of arrival?
We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
I have a schedule...
I told you...
With who?
You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
You people...rich people...
Self sufficient...
On the side!!
This time, make an exception.
He's not coming...
Sure I do...I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of dentination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed.
I don't know...you got what we need?
Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast?
And you got 10 minutes before this thing livens up a boring evening.
She fucked me.
You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.
I'll get it! Where is it?
I'm telling you, they changed it!
It's gotta!
Nick...?  Jesus, Nick!
In case!!! The gun's in case!!!
In case???!!! In case of what? In case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall?!
It won't open.
Married?
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
You are frightened, no?
Ah yes. Of course.  To the girl who waits.
But of course! Please make yourself comfortable. Perhaps you would enjoy some fresh caviar, or une petite glace, or --?
Everybody love Linda.
Too bad.
Who's got the ammo?
Psst. Vince!
Fine. Hey, I'm fine.
No. How's Angela? How's she taking it?
Talked to Sal?  Sal's alive?
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
Listen, Biederman, I'm going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so important.
I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking --
Will you marry me?
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump. Would you like a Coke? You don't drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What about champagne? Let's have champagne! I don't think we have champagne. Let's have this. See? Sparkling. I'll get you an opener. Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's just have beer. Do you want some cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we should have coffee.
Naw, it's... I mean...
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
You're going hunting?
That's wonderful. I think you should... fresh air.
Playing?
Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand?
The shot?
Oh.
Hunt with Vince?
I thought you might be praying.
I mean forget Sal... Sal can't take it, Nick.
Three bullets -- minimum.
Nick!... I thought you went home.
Merle... Hey, Merle, listen...  Why?
What do you mean, no???
Listen, Nick --
John Wayne's great... Listen, Sal. Jesus. When are you getting out?
Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.
I know. It's like coming from the moon. Or Mars.
I tracked this one, a big buck. God, he was such a beauty--! What's this suitcase here?
It's all right. Hey, it's all right. We'll be right here, right with you.
I mean, I guess you still think about Nam. Right? I mean --
No!
And I believed you! I oughta punch you out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey, let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey, Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do you say? Nick? What do you say?
Sure.
I just... would like to say a few words... about Merle. I guess Merle always wanted something... I don't know... better. That fucking guy, he saved my Life. He saved Sal's... What Merle liked, he liked things right... But then there wasn't any place for that... that he could find.
What did you say?
Mom, I hate to break this to you, but there's a whole other species out there you're neglecting.  If you've forgotten, they're called 'men'.  Sometimes referred to in more colorful language.
Who are you?  What the fuck do you want?
No, you're not model material.  Anything else?
I'm going to bring this down hard. I've got an A-1 badass killer loose, an election day after tomorrow, and I'm risking everything on you. You're going to bring him in.  I don't care how.  If you do, you'll get your freedom.  An official pardon from me.  A clean slate.  A good job.  A chance to get back with your family.  If you don't want to, I'll put your ass back in the freezer so fast, you'll forget you were ever defrosted.
I'll be alright.
I'm not voting for you.
We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
I got it.  I got it.
Ooops, I forgot.
Whoa.  Don't touch that.  <u>Pursuit</u> <u>Mode</u>.  Auto pilot.  Computerized steering and driving system used in high speed pursuits.  Installed Fall 2006.  Underground rumor has it they modeled it after you, sir.
Technothugs.
Well, I'm sure.  You're a cop.  I'm a cop.  Let's do what cops do.
You don't follow the bodies, and you don't follow procedure.  You do it by instinct.  Think like him.  Do what has to be dane.
GCI.  TM-1.  What language are you talking?
Hey, Rip Van Winkle, maybe we'd better call it a night.
I'm serious, Wade.  This case is important to me.
Not yet.
Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
If you were set up, I want to find out who did it.
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
You startin' a fan club or some- thin'?
You never want to find out.
He went dirty and they made an example of him.
You could always take it off.
And what about Daniel Webster?
What's that, sir?
It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?
Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
You are afraid!
I do -- and I think you should too.
Oh, certainly. I shan't even come to the christening -- it would be tactless and in wretched bad taste.  But I may send a friend of mine -- just for old sake's sake. Yes, I might do that.
My time isn't up yet.
Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose.
Thanks, Mr. Webster!  To the champion of the whole United States -- Dan'l Webster!
Well -- I'll be -- if it isn't little Mary Sampson from Franklin.
Contracts? -- Yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything.
Then I'll just christen the jug, with your permission, Stone. Somehow or other, waiting's wonderfully shorter with a jug.
Well, I --
Headache -- Squire?
How do you do, Belle? How are you, Jabez?  Well -- mighty elegant house you got here.
5000 -- that's just what I owe you.
Who is it?
Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.
If the pig hadn't broke his leg, we could have taken him.
To save us work on the spring plowing?
You always said, the field uphill needs a rest, but if you think --
Oh, Jabez -- it was a wonderful day --
Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
And I don't want to have a washwoman for a wife.
My fault? ... Oh, Jabez -- all I want is to be proud of him. He can be such a fine boy, if we show him how to be.
What's the matter with 'em? Why don't they come?
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!
Well ... make him keep quiet.
Lan's, I'd think you was having the baby, to hear you.
I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son.
I say -- it don't matter.
Now that's the way to talk, Son! I know you worked hard for that crop. But we'll make out.
Mary -- Jabez --
You aren't angry with me?
Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
No, you wouldn't -- You're not the sort of woman that's afraid of smoke -- or fire -- But now let's talk about your affairs.
You see, I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey, but none of us minded. Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. I've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean. I've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. That's not like him, Mr. Webster -- It must be my fault somehow -- my fault.
Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name?
Scratch will do for the evening. May I -- join you?
And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England? 'Tis true, the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in the country than yours.
Let it be the quick or the dead -- So it is an American judge and an American jury!
I object.
I want someone to talk to ...
You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?
Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.
So, you divorced of what?
Hey, I negotiate million dollar deals for breakfast.  I can handle these clowns.  I want to talk to Hans.  Hans! Sprickenzie talk?
You're amazing.  You figured this all out already?
I read about them in Time magazine.  When these Revolutionary Brothers and Sisters are Free, the hostages in this building will be taken to the roof and they will accompany us in helicopters to the Los Angeles International Airport where you will be given further instructions.  You have two hours to comply.
You want...money?  What kind of terrorists are you?
Only if New Jersey counts.
They invited me to the Xmas party. Who knew?
That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.
When you're hot, you're hot.
Sure.  Follow me.
You want to know my idea of a marriage? It's a partnership where people help each other over the rough spots -- console each other when there's a down...and when there's an up, well, hell, a little Goddamn applause or an attaboy wouldn't be too bad.  I needed that, John.  I deserved that.
Yeah.  I remember our first date.
Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours?  That doesn't even make any sense --
I...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to make a joke of it.
I hope so.  But that's up to the guy upstairs.  Upstairs...  ...Hans, you bastard...what were you doing?
I don't think so, Sir.  In fact... I think he's a cop.  Maybe not LAPD, but definitely a badge.
Going in...are you out of your mind? There's 30 hostages in there -- for all we know --
Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
No.  I never smile any more.
Don't let 'em off the ground.
Fuck you, sir - if I'm right, I don't need you.  What I want is - if I make an honest mistake I want help.
You men shoot, aim for the white meat!
I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  Yellin' at me in front of all those people.  Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never.  I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river.
Heidi - why didn't you come down here?
That's why I can talk to you, as an equal, Sonny.  You got to merge your whole soul with God.  And then you are Him and one with the Holy Ghost.
Hello, Sonny.
Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out?
Oh... huh ... how you feeling?
That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
So... that sure is something.
Yeah... I know.
I don't know what I'm doing.
That's it.
I know!
Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped!
Sonny, would you please just tell them... please...
All right!  He didn't do it.  All right?  Now... would you get the fuck off the phone?  I'll bet that really changed them, huh?  Anyway, Leon... did I do it for you?
What are you doin' in there?
I got Sal.
Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin' to call you.
Call me whatever you want.
Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  I want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me.  So you can see you can trust me.  So we can talk and find a way outta this mess.
It's okay, you got a lot of protection.
Okay, what do you give me?
No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you.
So, what were they doin'?  You're tellin' me you had nothin' to do with that back there?
Well, what were you doin' back there?
All right ... I got some hungry people in there ... I want to get some pizza ... some stuff like that ...
What else?
I want to talk to him.
Well, you get your mind right.  I'm a Catholic and I don't wanna hurt nobody, but goddamn it, don't you play no games with me.  Unnastand?!?
My side, shit!
I don't care who you are ...  I just want to get you outta here, safe, right?
Sure - we like you.
I don't think so.
Yeah.  Well, you're okay?
Hey.  It's raining.
You shouldn't start now.
You gonna smoke the cigarette?
... The bodies out the door.
I want him to think that.
But I want to know what you think.
We'd kill ourselves.
I want them all.
Gimme the black guy...
You can't allow!  I'm running this thing, what gives you the idea you can say shit?  Come on.  I'll pay you.  Whatta you want?  Two hundred?  A thousand?
Those bastards -- they poisoned the pizza!  Sal - you didn't eat any pizza!?
They're beautiful ...
Mom - I got it all worked out; it's over.  The best thing is you go home.  Watch it on TV.
I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.
Don't talk to them anymore.  Sal and me are getting a jet, we're going to Algeria - I'll write you from there.
What's wrong with that?  The FBI was very understanding when I explained it to him.  Everybody knows it isn't you ... It's the pressures from your home life.
Mom.  Mom.  There are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son.
Yeah!  We're hot entertainment, right?  You got me and Sal on TV ... we're entertainment you sell, right?

That's the rumor on the street.
I refuse to turn out like them. Twenty-one years old and they're already looking for a husband.  Stupid fucking cunts with no self- esteem. They let the boys control their lives. Not me.

Nobody.
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
Excuse me.  I'm very sorry.
Not only did you knock me down, you stepped on my new white Air Jordans that I just bought and that's all you can say, "Excuse me?"
If I wasn't a righteous Black man you'd be in serious trouble. SERIOUS.
Yeah, I asked him.  I don't want nobody in there, nobody spending good money in Sal's.  He should get no mo' money from the community till he puts some Black faces up on that motherfucking wall.
Jade, I still love you.
What did I tell ya 'bout dem pictures?
Ask Sal.
No, you the man.
You're a drunk fool.
I didn't.
We're still standing.
Gotta go.
C'mere, Doctor.
That's it?
I said my name is Eddie Lovell.
Later.  Gotta get paid.
I think no such a thing.  Sal pays you, you should work.
Yo, I'm gone.
See ya around.
Nice!
I got nowhere to go.  We haven't had a good sit-down for a long while.
Be gentle, child.  Mother Sister is an old woman.
Mister Señor Love Daddy, I'd like to dedicate the next record to my heart, Tina.
That's right on time.  This is my friend, Vito.  His pops is Sal.
Can you pay me now?
Mookie, I don't know what you're talking about, plus I don't want to hear it.
C'mon, Sal.
Make dat money.  Get paid.
Tina, what do you want me to do?
Do I love you?
Your memory is really getting bad.
Meda.  Meda.
To get my money.
Eddie Murphy.
Fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck Frank Sinatra, too.

Ya like him, huh?
That's what I think.
I'm listening.
HATE!
I love you.
Be right there, Pop.  Listen to what I said.
Baby listen, there's nothing more American than not doing anything and getting away with it.
In the new library there.
Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
Yes, you and the whole Special Needs class.
Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special
She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.
What? No! Look.
I don't follow.
My mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school.
What?
Shift to your left.
Sure, but first we have to find kids special, needy and classy enough to be in Special Needs.
Just a guy I hang out with.
I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
Welcome to public school, my friend.
When you live in the basement of the school, you breathe in a lot of chalk dust. It writes out all the answers on your brain.  Now how about a slushee?
A. Slushee. Don't tell me.  Abraham Slushee. Third president of the United States.
You know... She's gonna be all over you like a barrel of monkeys, with her tight shirt and short skirt... Eeeww, it's so faggy I can't even talk about it.
HARRY!
Oh, telling inside jokes now, are we? That's it. You're out of the cool crowd. Next time Turk's passing out wedgies, you ain't gettin' one.
Are, too.
That must be her boyfriend's car.
Hey, let's go spy on them.
Me, too. This is my favorite part of the tape.
But my mom gave me the map.
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
Right. She's so proud of her boyfriend.
We never thanked him for giving us our Special Needs class.
Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!
I don't think that'll happen. We've learned a valuable lesson we won't ever forget.
No Lloyd. Chicks are for fags - I'm not going to do it.
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
One phone call from the principal will take care of that, my dear.
Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
Oh Harry's doing just fine, he's just about to open up.
Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.
Let's just do it and get out of here.
That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?
No, it was a complete waste of time.
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
I liked it a lot.
Oh yeah, give it to me.
It's too close to call.  Okay next contest, now lets...
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
Well you know Detective, he's expecting  'Moffit' to be someone who has... certain... well...
Yes you are. 
Yes, it's the big potato. Just have a look at this.
Oh, this is fantastic. So all we have to do is kill this Moffit guy and we get all the money!
No. No. That's not it. We don't kill him. We don't kill anybody. But I like the way you're thinking. You're focused and you're trying to follow. No, what we need to do is start a fake Special Needs class.
Who's there?
Well I've got a little surprise for you.
Everything?
Yes. So as soon as Zimmer shows up, we'll get our check and blow this pop stand before anyone finds out anything.
No... no it's not horse, you see I sold the horse.
We felt his presence.
Yes?
Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.
Is this what you seek?
Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
No, but many consider my training valuable.
Death may be the result....  Are you sure?
I must do this for Paul, but what of my unborn child?
Paul... please, Paul... listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you.
The South Polar regions... the forbidden area.  We must make it to that rock...
I'm ready.
Yes...
Bless the Maker and his water... Bless the coming and going of him.  May his passage cleanse the world.
Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?
NO!! ENOUGH!! Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood that much. I must have wanted you to fail. Take your hand out of the box and look at it, young human.... Do it!
SILENCE!
Yes.  I'm embarking on another bus- andótruck tour of "Dracula." Twelve cities in ten days, if that's conceivable.
Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
I never thought of that.
No hospital.  Just take me to the couch...
I don't know how to make goulash.
I'm not getting near that goddamn thing.  One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu."
This is the Philosophical Research Society.  A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years.
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
Don't let me slow you down.
I'm sorry, Eddie.  I'm so sorry.
Soon, Bela... Soon.
No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.
That's great.  Let's do a take.
I know none of <u>my</u> wives would've.
Rolling.
NO!  It has to be UNDERWATER!
Edward Wood, Sir.
No.  They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
The ghost can be barefoot.  <u>Give</u> <u>me your shoes</u>!
Yeah!  I met a movie star!  Somebody <u>really big</u>!
No!  A horror movie star!
Boris Karloff!?
I thought he was dead.
Since I was a kid.  My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.  It just kinda became a habit.
Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
Ah!  Atomic Age stuff, huh?  I like it.  I'll tell you what, Mr. Ward.  Why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and I will take a look at your little opus.  Maybe we can do business together.
It's a guaranteed blockbuster!
Um, I understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars?
I like to think so.
Yes?
Da pleasure be mine.
Oh, of course!
Bela, he talk.  Loretta, she talk. But Tor, he no talk.
Don't worry.  You just haven't met right woman yet.  Oopsy.  That cabbage goes right through me.
We're escaping!
Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
So you're not gonna make the movie?
No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
So change the poster.  Trust me, you'll be better off.  This is a story that's gonna <u>grab</u> people.  It's about this guy.  He's crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses.  Should he tell her? Should he not tell her?  He's torn. George, this is DRAMA.
Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
They'll notice.  Look, why don't you let me take over from here?  I can do a few tricks: Pad it out with more stock footage, add establishing shots...
Good.  And one more thing.  I think your "Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea.
Nah, 'cause I had my comic books. And I read pulp magazines.  And I listened to the radio dramas...
A few years ago, I actually saw him do "Dracula" live.  I thought he was much scarier in person.
The sun.
So?  It's only a five-hour drive. And it'll probably clear up, once we hit the desert.  Heck, it'll probably clear up once we drive around the corner.  I promise.
You want me to show it on my TV program?  Well I got nothing to do with that.  You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven --
You're <u>sure</u>???
So how long have you known Eddie?
That was Karloff.  Paul, you gotta try harder.  I don't want this film to be haif-assed. This time, we go for the quality.
Doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid?
Are you IN5ANE?  <u>I'm</u> the director! <u>I</u> make the casting decisions around here!
Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
She's in the kitchen. I'd yell for her, but I'd die.  You had a busy night last night.
Yeah. Ma...
They celebrated the common person.
Our neighbors gave me a ride.
Oh, Al ... This is just...
Cool.
Don't say that. That's like... telling a guy before you have sex you'd better be good. You don't do that.
Could we just talk alone for a second? I --
Good idea.  Could you all leave us alone for a few minutes?
That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.
Yeah, that's why I called. I mean, maybe Fed-Ex would tell me where she moved --
Ed --
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
I'm not sure about the entire concept.
Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...
We're the guys who clean up after the parade.
Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor substitute?
Right, right...
Mm.
He says --
He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
I'm at the hospital.
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
St. Joseph's.
Ma...
And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
I'm a whore!  Your bathrooms are filthy!
Shari, Ray feels --
What is she, at work?
She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself.
All right. Let them decide.
Our what?
Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
You batted or you bunted?
So?
Dynamite is dangerous.
Yeah.
I missed you.
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
I know, I ...
Ohh...
What?
Everybody's someone.
What do we have to do?
What?
Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
Richie!  She spent six months dating a criminal
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
It's the receptionist at one of the places I service video equipment -- she's very pretty and, you know, she never even talks to me and then today I come in and she's all "I saw you on TV the other night... You were so great ... " Next thing I know we're ...
No, not her. Shari. Go over there and talk to her
I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
I love you! 1 want to marry you!
Thanks... That's ...
No. It's going to be about a half-hour.
El/ella -
pierde.
Yeah, it's serious.  I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.
But you haven't written your novel.
He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents. I haven't heard from him in a long time. Poor guy. I warned him.
Thank you.
You guys have fun?
What?
Dick.
I'm not supposed to tell. Not until you've counted too. We're each supposed to make an independent count.
I think we've got a problem.
It happens, Larry. People make mistakes.
Tracy.
Ethics are...
NO, that's fine
Looks like Tim Kobza.
If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
I don't.  I just know they were there when I left.  I'm giving you helpful information is all.  You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.
I don't know what you're referring to, but I do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay.
Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
Why are you doing this?
Coming to see me.  Are you trying to. . humiliate me?
I've got an idea.
Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  That's not what student government's about.
Yeah... whatever.  All I know is she's a troublemaker.  She's on my list.
Hmm?
Oh.  Okay.
Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you?
Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word.
I did it.
Okay.  Give me the drill.
Dave.
Take me to that motel.  Like you wanted.
Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.
And she's super-nice
Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
Okay, let's say
No, wait -- apples.  Apples.
I don't know.  You're her brother you should know.
It was Tammy I  That's who it was.
Yeah.
Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
What's it to you?
Yeah, plain scotch.
Miss Bracken, don't ever try to fucking bribe me or threaten me or I'll have you and Patchett in shit up to your ears.
Maybe I'm just fucking curious.
Yeah.
When they deserve it.
He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
I don't know.
How'd you get to know so much about him?
So tell me about it.
Dudley, what do you want?
And for good reason judging from what I know of your background.
It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell?
He helped me out once.  That's all.
Wendell, I want you to come to work for me.
You said a neighbor heard a ruckus.  Was it outside, inside?
It's a surprise.  You like surprises, don't you, White?
Lynn.
For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice.
He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
Me?  You called it.  I got a message that...
I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
I don't know him.  Mr...
Wait.  Our deal still holds?
You remember an ex-cop named Buzz Meeks?  He works for a guy named Patchett.
More's gonna cost you.
Nothing.
Someone must've pulled the records.
Yes, Dudley.  I am.
It's mine.  I'll make you my second in command.
Get on it.
And now you'll provide them.
Absolutely.  Prostitution and gambling are victimless crimes. The heroin we'll run down to the coloreds.  Anesthetize them.  As long as it's not a middle class problem, no one will care.  It's still a crime free city... for respectable people.
Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?
Don't start trying to do the right thing, John.  You haven't had enough practice.
Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?
Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.
Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?
I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.  I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.  There's more if you want to hear it.
You, me and White, huh?
Actually, Bud's only tough on the outside.
Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is.
Where is he?
Do you have any proof?
What's Dudley's scheme?
Is she?
How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  Did you know Loew was a swish?
What happened with the kid and Loew?
Please hold, Sergeant...
Yeah.  Me neither.
Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.
I'm telling you, I--
Don't know. Did you check everywhere? Maybe it was hidden in something. Maybe there was someone else--
Be careful, Danny.
Who are they?
You're crazy.
It's a SAT-tracker.
They're spooks.
No shit.
We said a hundred.
What do you mean?
It really is.  Did you find anything?
Yeah.  Take a walk with me.
The NSA killed him.
Jesus. Do you have proof?
Well, actually, <u>you</u> have proof. Could you walk a little faster please.
'Kay, well, could you walk faster, please.
You're driving.
Those are Feds.
Goddammit--
What about newspapers and magazines?
They've done it before. Takes maybe two minutes.
Is Jerry Delsano in?
You got any money?
Yes. I have her permission.
Okay.
Why?
Witnesses said you were there, but I notice you didn't file a report.
I can't.
I'm just trying to determine if Mr. Zavitz was involved in something more than a simple bus accident.
Than why don't you talk to the bus driver?
I'm happy to help you all I can. But I didn't see the accident and I barely knew Daniel Zavitz. I've gotta go to work.
To buy lingerie.
I thought maybe it might be for Rachel Banks.
You should take this seriously.
What'd you buy at Harrison's?
Have you been working with Rachel?
"Sources revealed an FBI investigation into a possible money laundering scheme that may have sent millions of dollars--
Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
Was that doctored-up, too?
I went to the grocery store. My ATM and credit cards didn't work. I couldn't buy food.
I was in a car chase and a small explosion. Now listen to me: The NSA is behind this. They think that guy I told you about, Daniel Zavitz, they think Zavitz gave me a tape or computer chip of some kind that could be damaging to them. So they're doing all these things <u>electronically</u>. The bank records, the surveillance. They're the ones who broke into the house. Now I know there's no reason to believe me. But I love you. And I love our son. So just believe me anyway.  Please.
Good.
Here, you can use this.
It's not?
This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
You're right, Mr. DePinto, and maybe I jumped the gun.
So you've said.
I <u>like</u> our history. And I like you. I'd probably like <u>Brill</u> if I ever got to--
He doesn't work that way.
I wouldn't let you. Good luck with DePinto.
I'm gonna fix it.
How?
I've never met him?
I <u>did</u> care how.
Yeah.
Who <u>are</u> you people?
Shut the fuck up.
You're Brill.
Maybe Bellmoth. Maybe the unions. I don't know.
Why?
In your dreams.
You've got a bunch of Armani suits, they didn't take 'em?
No.
The blender?
An investigation? It was a bus accident.
It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.
You're tired.
You gotta--
Bobby, you're in way over your head.
Yeah.
I honestly don't know.
You're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? <i>Terrorism,</i> you unconscionable asshole?
I just meant--
Oh, let's assume that they have.
Do you have visual?
For Daniel Zavitz. I just need a signature.
The door was open, sir. I just need a signature.
I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
A thing is still a thing no matter what you place in front of it.  Big car, slow car, chauffeur-driven car, still a car.
I don't want to go back.
That insults them.
I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this.  I apologize if I appear abrupt.  I am rusty at social graces.  How do you find Cairo?  Did you visit the Pyramids?
Excuse me.
So why follow me?  Escort me, by all means.  Following me is predatory, isn't it?
A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.
Ask Al Auf. Almásy asks Al Auf in Arabic.
Find that plant.  Cut out its heart.
Will you please come in?
Don't.
It's a long song - Szerelem means love…and the story - there's a Hungarian Count, he's a wanderer, a fool.  For years he's on some kind of quest, who knows what? And then one day he falls under the spell of a mysterious English woman - a harpy - who beats him and hits him and he becomes her slave.  He sews her clothes, he worships the hem of -
Of course.  You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
You speak so many bloody languages and you never want to talk.
Oh dear.
I haven't, no.  Sorry.
Her hands and feet were tied.
Bermann!
In my room.
What's the matter with you?
Own the desert.
I told you so.
Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
Petty thief, six months imprisonment Kingston Penitentiary, 1937.
Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life?
What if I told you he did this to me?
I don't know what that means.
Finally!  So you're our Canadian pickpocket?
All over?  I kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed.  Are you leaving us?  Now's our opportunity to swap war wounds.
I don't know.  Paper.  Is it? Paper?  I don't remember.
What? Hana comes in, sleepily, frowns at the gramophone.
I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.
Lady H said she thought you might be -
Aren't you?
I do so love you.  What do you smell of?
Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
This is Clive Fenelon-Barnes.
Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army.
Thank you.
When my wife comes to lie down she always lays her garments one by one on a seat near the entrance of the room, and from where you stand you will be able to gaze on her at your leisure…
No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
He needn't disturb you.
Please, don't waste your time on pleasantries -
That's a different dress.
He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?
You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk.
Hana, I know you do!
The Germans were here.  The Germans were all over this area.  They left mines everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
I don't think so.
You get Hardy.
I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.
You must get away.  Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling.  He's going to topple over if he cuts.
I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin.  And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can.  A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.
I'll always go back to that church.
When he dies I'll catch up.
He can't even move.
He's from there - edge of Lake Ontario right, Soldier?
I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
Pardon me?
- The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum.
What are you talking about?
This was your garden?
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
I don't know, but close.
I'm going to get him, I promise you.
That is of no interest.
Uh. I'm showing off.
You're like malaria. Once you get it, you can't get rid of it.
Uh, yes.
Meet me in front. Five minutes.
You're joking.  You can't trust anyone these days.
I sincerely hope so.
We were, we are, but this is perfect for you.
I suspected it might be worthy of your interest.
That's my girl.
I'm paying...one point five million and change. I hate round numbers.
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
Not funny.
I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.
Precisely. You give me the Mask security code, I steal the Mask, you get a finders fee. At ten percent, should be two or three million at least. Not too bad.
So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
We are...for the tools.
Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
Don't get any ideas. Of course it comes out of your share.
When I was a girl my father took me to the edge of El Capitan. Three thousand feet of granite. Straight down. I was so scared my mouth was full of cotton. I couldn't talk, just stood there shivering...like this.
Aren't we all.
Bookshelf. Sensors--
Popup, on floorboards. And--
Duh.
No, no, please God, you're wrong. I'm a thief. Just like you.
It's your mistake.
I always knew you'd do the job.
The eight billion. From them to us.
Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it.
But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer.
Sit down, I'll show you how we're going to do it.
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
It was wrong to deceive you.
Have really held you under?
A flaw in your research, my dear. I grew up chewing shoe leather for breakfast.
No way.
The key to success is using the right tools.
It's a death mask. Death mask means dead.
Remind me why.
I'm terribly sorry old man.
I'm waiting for the tell part.
You know where my loyalties lie.
She won't tell me everything. It's a bank job, that's all I know.
Thought you had to use some of these.
Don't use language with me --
I'm gonna assume that was meant as a compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.
He's a low-life.  Speaking of which, that's your nine o'clock in there.
There's more than one?
He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control --
She must be a tough cookie, cause it's a pretty advanced case.  I'd say she's been walking around with it for a few weeks now.
Hell, no.  I hate lawyers.  I just work for them.  You got a minute?
It's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there.
I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking to?  He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list.
Any school you want.
Bullshit.  You told me I'd get half a million dollars.  You told me I'd be set.
<u>Settle down</u>?  I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr. Masry!  I can't <u>afford</u> to settle down!
Oh.  Huh.  Well, look, I got this file I need valued. Real estate thing.  A lady has some property next to a PG&E plant that PG&E wants to buy. I need to know what to ask for it.
Oh, yeah?
Find out.
That wasn't an offer.  A million would've been an offer.  When they send the God damn mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my time, it's a fuck you.
Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.
Well -- I found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from 1967.  A hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then.
<u>No</u>.
I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
No --
Yeah?  Then gimme another raise.
I was just asking.  Are you all right?
Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer.  20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it or leave it.
I'm thinking ... I wish someone else had to make this decision.  50 thousand bucks is more than any other California toxic plaintiff has gotten. Ever.  But ...
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
The luckiest son of a bitch in the universe, Erin.  The luckiest son of a bitch in history.
Here what comes?
Take it.
Nope.  And I didn't ask.
Heck, yeah.  Come on back.  Just gonna need you to sign in here --
You're married.
County water board.  All righty, thanks.
Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure?  We're going someplace you never been before.
Yeah, we had them couriered over.  And listen, good work.  They're a great start. We're just going to have to spend a little time filling in the holes in your research.
Whose number do you need?
I hope that's not supposed to impress me.
It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice.
I guess we get what we pay for, huh?
Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen.  I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone.
Lock the door.
Bull<u>shit</u>, Erin.  Bullshit.
What's that?
Real early.  We're just gonna take your car to get some breakfast.
We'll just be a minute.  Get a little more sleep.
I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine.  I don't even know how much they cost.
I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.
Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights?
Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
What?
Wow, that's soon --
Yes?
Don't go telling anyone.  It'll ruin my reputation.
The Emperor?
Yes, My Lord.
And code the signal to my private chamber.
This one I have watched a long time.  All his life has he looked away ... to the horizon, to the sky, to the future.  Never his mind on where he was, on what he was doing.  Adventure, excitement ...  A Jedi craves not these things!
We've come this far ... He is our only hope.
You must.  Luke, look at me!
Okay, okay.
That was a long time ago.  I'm sure he's forgotten all about it, and so should you.
No, I'm alright.  I'm alright.
Barks his Òright on!Ó
Look, it smells good.  I'm sure it's delicious   But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now.
Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
Probably isn't good enough, Sergeant. Check on it!
We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
What is it?
We're in trouble!
I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior.
You said you were going to stay. What happened?
Yes.
Not you?
I respect you.  You're a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest, but ... HAN No, your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about.
We are fighting for a cause much ...
Good.
That should do nicely.
You don't look angry.
Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
Sure, they're safer.  You always know what they're going to do. Trouble is, it gets a little dull.
You mean a man you can control.
Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
Can you trust him?
Huh?  Oh.  Your droid's been gone too long just to be lost.  He may have gotten into some trouble. Chewie went to look for him.  Come over here.  I want to check this out.
I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
I always said you were a gentleman.
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.
I didn't say anything?
Not yet.  They're working on it now.
Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.
Let's go.
Me too.  I was afraid.
Snow creatures ... they're here?!
No.  Try not.  Do, do.  Or do not. There is no try.
That they are.
No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
What's in there?
My mind fills with so many images.
Difficult to see.  Always in motion is the future ... Back away, little machine!
If it must be.  Yes.
I'll die first.
Time will tell.
A display of primitive apparatus --
Please
It's a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus. Genetically engineered. 100% pure death. Complete nervous system shutdown. You crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. Not a pretty sight.
Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
He jumped. Down there.  He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken.
You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
Not anymore.
I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working with you, Plissken.
All you need to know is get it back here by 5 a.m.
So you want me to take her out?  Is that an order from the President?
I said pull over.
All right. Anything for you, Snake.  Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones' place.
Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me, Snake. I can help you.
Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
We'll see.
All the sewers are collapsed under Venice. You have to go topside. Right up there.
I just thought you wanted to get away. I didn't know you wanted to go someplace.
Who ain't?
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
I, the best knight in the world, bested! This is a great day, for my search is over. I love you, my King.
I do. Rise, Lancelot, come with me.
Only give me leave to ride out again, to do what I am most able to do, and happiest doing.
What book is that?
The book without pages. Open before you, all around us. You can see it in bits and pieces, for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance, why, it would burn him to cinders.
Guenevere...
...to ride out and meet them.
A king should be afraid, always. The enemy is everywhere. Waiting in ambush in the dark corridors of his castle, on the deer paths of his forest, or in the gray and winding paths of a more tangled forest, in here.
Not you, my husband?
And you cannot love me...
I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
You.
Me?
Yes. I would swear my love to you.
To me? But why?
We are to blame.
Can it truly be used for magic?
It's clear you are, and it irks me.
That I cannot.
I am the desert, where water disappears--
One land, one king! That is my peace!
How about Lankaster Merrin.
I see, your excellency.
Oh great, anything else?
We have to start looking for a shrink.
Oh, I see.
That's good.
What is it? A tranquilizer?
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.
That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
I beg your pardon?
You could do it yourself...
Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months, under observation in the best hospital you can find.
You show me Regan's double: same face, same voice, same everything. I'd know it wasn't Regan. I'd know in my gut and I'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter! And I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind! You tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good! You tell me that!
Did you know my mother died recently?
No, is Regan aware of it?
She killed Burke Dennings. She pushed him out of the window.
Captain who?
It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.
You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
What?
Do you not like him like daddy?
Well your thinking's not so good.
Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.
I'm not Regan.
And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps!
If that's true, then you must know my mother's maiden name. What is it?
It would bring us together.
Quod nomen mihi est?
La plume de ma tante.
Momma, I'm all right, I'm fine, really I am.
The Lord be with you.
Let us pray. Holy Lord, almighty Father, everlasting God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who once and for all consigned that fallen tyrant to the flames of hell. Who sent your only begotten son into the world to crush that roaring lion.
Amen
And also with you.
You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
Very much.
I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K though, she gets tired and never likes to go.
I've seen it.
...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!!! It is he who commands you! He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to the depths of hell!
Do you have an appointment?
Yes
Yes I am her brother, he's the son
Give me the keys.
No.
So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.
Frank.
Uh-oh.  That's not good.  Let's get him up here.
Isn't there something you can give him?  A pill or something?
No bones?
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
Come on, friend.  I can smell it on you. Get yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget what you're angry about.
In the attic.  Behind some of Dad's stuff.  Look, Jack can hardly reach the pedals.
Jack.
Christ, will you look at your hair?
Of course, back then, things were a little different.  I was eight, Jack was seven, just about the only song we knew was 'My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean', and the only one who would listen to us was the family cat, Cecil.  We must have shaved three lives off that cat, eh, Jack?
Count the fucking money, Frank.
Fuck him.  Great.  Terrific.  Fuck him.
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
Look, I just thought if you came out you might see what you're missing.
You look awful.
Funny.  Strike a bell?
No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty. I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go.
What do you mean?
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
Frank.  Fuck it.  Okay?
It never was.
What?
Thirty-seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible.
Okay, okay.  I'll call the girl.
I didn't get her number.
I'll drop the eighths.
Come on, stand still.
That's what I figure.  Probably have us in a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.
I'll take my chances.
You wanna get a drink?
Very realistic.
Thanks, but I've got plans.
Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
Yeah.
So you're gonna leave it on. Every night.  For a week.
Really.
Two hours ago!
The party's over.
April.
I can't make the tenth.
Just until we find another girl.
You don't know?
We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium!
Dignity?  Who the hell are you to talk about dignity?
Sure.
No, it's not that.  I ... can't drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.
I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
Christ, that's right.  How could I forget.  What a nightmare.
Spur of the moment.
So what'd you think?
All right.
Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
Yes, it is.
Punctuality.  First rule of show business.
Just like that, huh?  You're not even gonna give me a chance?
Uh ... Frank Baker.  This is my brother.
That's the premise.
Is there a language problem here?  Your dress. For tonight.  Where is it?
It's orange!
You're a prince.
Piece of cake.
I was gonna split it with you guys.
The Carlton's a dump.  No cover.  No minimum. And they water their drinks. It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.
Maybe.  I'll call him.
Baker's unabridged.
Virgins?
It's paradise.  That's what it is. Paradise.
Great.
They must've bought the same map we did.
I don't believe it.  You're a romantic, Frank.
I just saw a man walk out of your room!
Thanks, Lloyd.
Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
Gotta go.
All right.  Hold on.
Save it.  What's he look like?
Pretty much.
Oh.  Well, for Blackie then.
Aren't the kids asleep?
How's egghead?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
How do you know?
My father proposed to my mother in there.
By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.
Coffee?
I've given it up.
I didn't want to wake you.
Married.
What are they?
I guess it's getting serious.
Wow.
Why not?
Okay.  How'd yours go?
Eddie.
The last time I took orders from you I ended up with five years probation.
Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing.  At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it.
I don't know.  Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.
And I bet I've kept that promise ...
She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
Something good?
I don't know ...  Maybe because you've never needed my help.
I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
Jon, what is it?
Go on.
Vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn't take long.
Castor Troy almost strangled me to death.  Where the hell were you?
You mean like ... condoms?
Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
You better get used to it. That bitch Lazarro is getting kicked upstairs. Guess what white-bread family man is going to replace her?
Trust me.  You're gonna love it ...
Just following your example.
Me.  I have doubts about your ability to stick with what is essentially a desk job.
What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
Okay, then.  I leave it in your able hands.
I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
-- Studying.
I disagree.  You think I've been acting strange.  Like a completely different person.
You're a ray of sunshine, Jack.
I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
Uh huh. The retail end, I understand.
I’m sure you do...
Seven.  Really.
Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for god’s sake!
She said that?
I’m telling you, those rules don’t apply to me, Arn.
I don’t care if you’re Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still can’t park here.
Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise it’ll be returned!
Damn, you are the real thing...
I don't do that.  That's just not for me...
Wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?
Me?
Get out!
I thought I saw you notice it at the kids’ recital.
Mr. Mintz?  I don’t think so...building’s closed pal.  You’ll have to come back tomorrow.
Uh-huh...
No, you’re right.  What are we doing?
Telling my mother she doesn’t have to stay with the kids.
She’s your dog, Jack.
Well that’s just great...those little monkeys can be a real handful...
It’s ten thirty, Jack. By eleven you’re gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We don’t have time for wining and dining.
It’s good, right?
What’s the difference? I’m taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
No.  Well, maybe a few things.  But mostly just different...
That’s a big one for me, too.
Think bigger.
Annie goes to a great school.
Please, just promise me you’ll do that. You have to promise, Kate. Because if you don’t, then it’s like it never happened and I don’t think I could live with that.
Promise me again...
I promise. Come to bed, honey.
Thank you, Betty.  I know if I can just sleep this off, I’ll be fine...
And God love you for it.
But you’re not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
You won’t regret it...  Tommy!  Set Mr. Conlin up with four B.F. Goodrich G-Force T/A’s...  ...and give him ten percent off for having the best costume...
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
Maybe it’s by the wardrobe boxes...
Congratulations. The La Guardia flight’s canceled but I got you out of Kennedy on United at nine. Am I good or what?
Tell me.  When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then.  You didn't listen to people.  So why start now...?
Ben.  This is business.  Just work.
No.  I cannot take orders from that underwear model.  That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
Youthful high spirits.
Victor's better at these things.
Ben.  This is serious.  <u>Turn around</u>.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
We're working as hard as we can --
Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?  Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible.  The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had the best --
Where do you <u>think</u>?  With <u>Sue</u>.
I'll schedule the launch.  Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
This place is deluxe.  You got cable?
Stay right.  Left is trouble.
I though we went over this.
You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
<u>Girl</u>...?!
Dude.  That's my sister.
Blockhead started it!
Sis.  Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
And if he's not...?
Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.
And that's a <u>good</u> thing?
Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
I was talking about us.  Working together.
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
What in the world would give me that idea?
And you sure you can control this thing?  Last time didn't work out so well.
Please, no apologies.  I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos.  You'll have round-the clock care.
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he <u>likes</u> having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it?  You're finally the perfect woman for him...because you're his <u>science project</u>.
Skeptical...?
That can't be -- there's no direct connection between the two --
No...
They'll make up some time, once they get through that and reach the Pleural Cavity.  Respiration Post...
That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...
What can I do? Except maybe pass out?
Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
He's blanked out on that one particular point.
Why don't you go on. We'll meet you at the Clearance Desk in a few minutes.
With no laser --
No danger of attack, as long as you don't trigger them off by any injury to the System.
No danger of an embolism. At our reduced scale, they're much too minute to prove fatal to Benes.
But I did. I'm positive!
I have no idea.
You can't --it's too dangerous --
A great deal more than that, I believe...
It's too late now. We must go on.
I don't agree. I think we ought to stop and take a sample.
Yes...
No, there's no other way.
A forced joining of an Artery and Vein. Must've happened when Benes was hurt.
We're safe -- long as it remains that color...  We're in the Pleural Sac.  It keeps the Lungs from rubbing against the Wall of the Chest up there. When those membranes become inflamed, we wind up with Pleurisy -- and a wracking cough.
No, we should reach the base of the Brain shortly. And from there, it's not far to the site of the injury.
Nothing you could see with the naked eye. But there's a microscopic radio-active particle inside.
I could use a lawnmower...
Was there any damage?
Then don't drift down further.
I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
Unghh... oh, geez...
You're required to display temporary tags, either in the plate area or taped inside the back window.
Can I see your license and registration please?
What's this, sir?
...What're you talking about?
Geez. That's more'n I've heard you say all week.
Well, okay, it's -
I'm not gonna sit here and debate. I will say this though: what Shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense.
Okay, it's - see, it's not me payin' the ransom. The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy - her dad, he's real well off. Now, I'm in a bit of trouble -
My wife! What the - how's -
Well, I'm sorry, but I just - I -
Well, okay, I'll talk to my boss...
Yah, I don't need no sealant though.
Yah, you don't need that. Now were you thinking of financing here?  You oughta be aware a this GMAC plan they have now, it's really super -
Oh, he's adorable.
Yah.
Ya got that right.
In what way?
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
So you were having sex with the little fella, then?
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even.
Oh, yah?
Yeah!
Yah!
What's the next step here, Jerry?
No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
No, no. See - they, no, see, they only deal with me. Ya feel this, this nervousness on the phone there, they're very - these guys're dangerous -
Dad! What're they doing? Wuddya think they're doin' with Mom?
Yeah, but -
Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing.
Ma'am, I answered your question.  I answered the darn - I'm cooperating here, and I...
Sir? Right now?
Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
No, fax is no good, that's what I have and I can't read the darn thing -
Okay, because if I can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then I gotta call back that money -
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
Jerome Lundegaard?
Yah!  I... those are in the mail.
Yah, no, I'm sure you are. Shep vouched for you and all. I got every confidence in you fellas.
...Is everything okay?
A heck of a lot. What'd you say you were gonna put there?
I mean a parking lot.
I thought you were gonna show it to Stan Grossman. He passes on this stuff before it gets kicked up to me.
2:30.
No! They said no cops! They were darned clear on that, Wade! They said you call the cops and we -
Well, they -
It's my money, I'll deliver it - what do they care?
...There's a million dollars here!
No, see -
Well, that's okay, I just -
Well, that's okay, he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm not worryin'. I just, I was wonderin', see, I gotta get in touch with 'em for, I might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see -
Geez, you okay, Margie?
Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.
Oh, yah?
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
You don't think he's mixed up in -
No, no, I just wanna get Norm some night crawlers.
Yah, that's a good one.
Yah, I'm down in the Twin Cities and I was just watching on TV about these shootings up in Brainerd, and I saw you on the news there.
Yah?
Yah - easy there - you do too!  I'm expecting, ya know.
Yah, ya know it's the Radisson, so it's pretty good.
You're livin' in Edina, then?
It sounds like you're doin' really super.
Yah, I, uh... She had leukemia, you know...
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -
Yah, he - he's been struggling. He's living with his parents now.
Yah, Linda's fine. You should call her.
The day of our homicides.
Sorry - didn't copy.
Oh. Gary's loudmouth.
There's the car! There's the car!
Yah?
They're real good.
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
Yah.
Your mallard?
Yah.
When they're stuck with a bunch a the old ones!
He's at -
Bob, Bob... I'm a member.
Yeah, both of us.
You want me to de-prioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade?
Have you finished those reports?
Pretend you're me.  You find this. What would you do?
I don't know if you're aware... your front door -- it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
I'd like to thank the academy...
Can't you give me something?
I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You aren't dying.
You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --
What the hell are you doing here?
I could check your prostate.
Well... thanks, anyway.
Hear what?
That... sawing and hammering.
Have we been talking too long?  Must we change the subject?
... A person.
He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!
I'm sorry, I...
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
Who's this?
Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the plane.  We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy.
I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
Is this part of the test?
Please return your seatbacks to their full upright and locked position.
My suitcase was vibrating?
Nine time out of ten, it's an electric razor.  But, every once in a while ...  ...it's a dildo.  It's airline policy not to imply ownership in the event of a dildo.  We use the indefinite aricle: "A dildo."  Never "Your dildo."
...And you open the door and you step inside.  We're inside our hearts.  Now, imaging your pain as a white ball of healing light.  That's right, the pain itself is a ball of healing light.
Now, find your power animal.
Oxygen gets you high.  In a catastrophic emergency, we're taking giant, panicked breaths...
Why?  So you can say, "Oh, that's what you do." -- And be a smug little shit about it?
What?
You called me so you could have a place to stay.
You get the idea.
I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?
Strange.
What fight?
Anyone?
My dad.  No question.
What?
Hemingway.  You?
Abe Lincoln.  Big reach.  Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
Listen... do me a favor... sit here a minute...
Promise you won't.
Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts.
No, I'm not...
I don't know...
Hey.
No.
I want to know --
I would feel nothing about my life? Is that what you want to hear?!
What... ?
We're going to have to do something about Marla...
Um, well... technically, no.
...go through with this? What are you going to do?
If you know, I know.
Don't pull the green wire.  Pull anything but the green wire.
Not my mouth.  Our mouth.
What?
No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
Yes, it is.
Okay!  Okay, fuck it!  Use the basement!  Get off me!
Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go!
I...I...
Six duds in a row.
No, it's not here.  This one was different.  More like the pile up and the van going into the lake.
I've got to stop and help those people.
She did.
Evan Shaeffer's dead.
No, I'm good.
There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die.  All of us!  I saw it!
I know, Dad.
They blame me for everything. Her, Tod, the plane crash...
Fuck you! I'll remove myself!
Why do you think I was hiding?
"Next?"
'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!
I'm not afraid! I DECIDE WHEN IT'S TIME! I control my life! I control my death!
Start over.
This is state-of-the-art firepower.
Damn!  Leeches.
Brewer.  Does a jet make noise?
What's that?
What?  Are you crazy?  We're supposed to take pictures and split. You're gonna blow the whole program.
You take pictures and split.  I'm going in.
Ain't you coming with us, sweet thing?
I thought he was with you.
Where's his father?
You think you are... .
Sorry, Sir.
I'm not jumping blind.
We just take pictures?
He... took it.
Black.  No sugar.
I know.
You think I'm some whacko?  I like to hurt people?  I'm doing a job here.  If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right?  So I follow directives... I do what I'm told.  It's simple.  If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.
It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said "No POWs" the sub-committee would buy it.  He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own.  If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C.  Airtight. But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero. Thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something.  He put me in a corner.  No choice.
What that?
Can you walk?
There were treating me like a headcase.
You're not.
I say we tape him to a chair.
It's an awful thing, let me tell you. My Aunt used to say,  "divorce is the sister-in-law of death".
I don't understand you. What is the problem?
I'm paying you.
Jack, he's starting a conversation...
Why don't you go upstairs... take the day off. All right?...I'll cook tonight.
Because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how America doesn't know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny TV celebrity because that would just mean that I'm not really talented.
I smell gas... Do you smell gas...
<u>What</u>!
You still believe in God?
Lydia?!  Lydia who!?
I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second.
The moron?
And who's Lydia?
I... You're not going to understand this.
You were great. Thanks alot.
He says if I want to get back to work, no problem.  He wants me to come in and talk and... and... <u>that's</u> <u>it</u>!
Thanks.
No... it's just...
Well, it's not unusual in his case... Sometimes victims of tragedies are subject to the brain's replay system. The brain never loses anything - it just stores it up and waits. A person could actually re-experience the full effect of a tragedy, long after the event took place. Are you relatives?  Well, it doesn't matter. We'll take care of it. He'll have to be sent back to the same institution.. 
What if I was a relative?
Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
Venice...Like Katherine Hepburn in SUMMERTIME. . ....Why can't I be Katherine Hepburn...
Leave me alone...I wanna go...
I was nine in the sixties.
A list.
Yes. Hi..Congratulations. Jack Lucas. Nice to meet you finally. This is Anne Napolitano, the owner of Video Spot.
Lydia.  Lydia what?
God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her.
My name is Parry.
Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.
No..I have to get back to work. Take care of yourself.
Well what am I gonna do with it?
You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.
Please don't hug me in public again, O.K.?
I LOVE THIS MAN...YA HEAR ME JADED CITY...  ...I'M DAFFY ABOUT THIS GUY AND I DON'T CARE WHO KNOWS IT!!!
Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!
Well, see, I think she can help...You know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere...
I know!
Yeah.....Hey they're moving....  Am I doing that?
<u>Nothing!</u> <u>They</u> <u>can</u> <u>do</u> <u>nothing!</u> <u>Gentlemen!</u>
How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's "The Purple Bread," an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery.  In subtitles.
Why does it sound exciting? There's absolutely nothing exciting about it.
Well - empires have fallen because of trashy romances...
Well, it's enough for me.
I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.
Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
And then we'll exchange phone numbers and you'll leave and never call and I'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch.  Why am I putting myself through this?  It was very nice... uh meeting you. Good night..
You're married.
Shhh...
Well, lemme sing the one I picked an' see what you think...  "When there's a fire in your heart/Break the glass/Sound the alarm..."
Serveza yourself!
I did, didn' I, El?
I'm sorry.
Now, hand...
I'm not going to get up an' leave you.  Now let's go over to El's an' have a good time.
I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone.
It brings out my eyes...
Five'll do it.
Only what's on the menu...  A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.
Hi, Tita.
Now don't...
Oh, well, what, what's he...
All right...
Why are you being so mean?
And you no longer play at all?
That's dangerous, you know.
Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
Tomorrow's a full practice day...  But the day after is kind of open.
If you're free.
Yeah, I'll probably be free.
None.
Yes.
I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
That's what I mean...
No, it's okay.
Well, I was goin' to, but Bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first, which I can understand, but then it went an' took so long, I ran flat outa money...  I didn't have no number to call, you know.  So I hadda clear outa there an' come on up here, in the hopes that I wouldn't be intrudin' myself...
I don't know where you were, penis envy.
A dispose-all, what's that but more crap? I've never seen such crap. Oofh, I don't know how people get up in the morning.
Steam.
Pardon me?
Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.
I have a suggestion. Why don't we take a break.
Victor.
Nothin'.
You know somebody around here?
A play-ya.
Me? No. Don't want none either. Such bastards, man.
Just chill.
No you didn't, you ain't provin'it.
Natasha, Maria, Tina-
No, Baruch.
You said before, that he got boxes?
Yeah.
Wha'?
She didn't say she had no man.
I suggest you turn around and go back to where you came from.
Positive.
Probably.  One of the many.
Hey!
Wha'?
Would you like me to change anything?
You mean her.
What goddamn right do you have to take him?
They didn't do anything.
Hey, you and Tommy Lasorda. That's great.
That a boy.
I said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go home and I'll call you tomorrow.
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
Oh, he was dying for years.
Just relax....
Honest, I feel fine. You better be married.
No idea at all?
Affirmative.
The two surfer boys?
Can I get you something?
It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that...
Wait a minute! Our problems might be solved.
What?
Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
My parents were great fans of the former President.
Since he moved to L.A.
What the hell does this have to do with insurance?
Of course they are.
Right.
Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
No problem.
Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk.
Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you.
Very good. My .357. Use it and no one can trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray.
I don't think you'll have to worry about that.
It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.
'Magic' today, huh?
Shoot.
Not me.
Not our kind of people, you understand.
Spot right here.
Nothing to it.
Cute thing.
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
How long have they been married?
We used to fly together. I'm... John.
That's a strange combination.
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
Hi.
What about his parents?
Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him.
Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and I wasn't at your wedding.
That's what I want to know.
But I've seen the deed.
I checked. There was no divorce.
Bastard.
What?
Tell the cops.
You broke it? You know the source?
Practically.
It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.
Get out of here.
But not unsubstantiated charges about dope-dealing cops, and not horse shit paranoid fantasies about homicidal police chiefs.
Fletch.
Jim Swarthout?
Frieda's boss.
But I ain't got you...
No, I ain't got you...
Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
Oh... I have some questions.
Uh, let's go sit down.
Nonsense.  After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you.
Thanks, I needed that.
I'm not cynical.  Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now.  Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle.
No prob...
You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
I wish I knew.  You did good work...
Make eye contact when you say that.
Then I guess her case is closed. Mine isn't.  I want to know why everybody wants Zuzu.  Why people are killing and dying for her.
Su-ure.  Two people hired me to find Zuzu in order to get hold of one of those discs and Colleen threw a tizz when we took hers.  Obviously, all this binary disc shit is pretty mighty.  But it's not necessary.  People are dead.  One was a friend.  The same people were involved in a scam to rip off Grendel Records. Bottom line's Julian Grendel is doing a little revenge number...
Are you okay?
Zuzu, be quiet.  Put in Colleen's disc.  Number two.
As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
Just be thankful he wasn't dissatisfied with his sex life.
Who's my real father, man?
You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'
You were the lead sing -- Lieutenant, I didn't think anyone could cheer me up tonight... Thanks.  Really.
Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
You gotta be kidding!  This is unfuckingbelievable!  I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young!  Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard!  Then, then, after I burned up your brother, Jazz... I should say as a fucking footnote I've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out Domino's Pizza's phone number and saying it's mine... Tonight was different. I felt respect.  I felt love.  Then Jazz left me... and <u>now</u> I get to die!
Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.
Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end.  Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.
What?
No - no.
Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.
Sal --
Don't forget anchovies. 
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Man, I'm clean.
Hell no -- my end is covered -- my associates just feel we ought to wait for a more opportune time to make the switch.
Avec ça tu pourras le supporter.
Not any woman, Marie.  Just one.
What's he do?
Yeh?  Who else?
This Charnier guy.  He's in shipping?
Willie Mays.
I hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer.  I come by to help you carry out your money.
Where the hell is it?
I'm wounded.  Oh, oh.
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
We're goin' now!  Goodbye.
Pass.
You remember Mary Finelli?
What I know is what I told you.
So what?
Yeah.
They around?
Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this.
I'm alright, Gibby.
Don't know what's behind it.
One way to find out.
You didn't marry Donna Reed.
He did.
Sure.
One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
I love you more.
So am I.
I gotcha, I gotcha Chief!
Do you know where I found this?
Frank, please...
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are gonna win 5-3.  Go watch the game, Satch.
I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.
29-years ago.
We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.
Yeah...I think so.
Nah, I gave it up.
Why?
Yeah.  I'm okay.  What about you?  I want to know.  About you.  And your mom.
It's Mom.
How?
Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli.  Girl disappeared in '68.  Turns out she was his first kill.  Which means he probably knew her.  Most serials know their first victim.  I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together...
Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
My father didn't die in a fire?
Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.
She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
Just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. Not everyone fits the profile.
Hey, Ma, it's me.  Checking in.  Probably at work.  Anyways, I'll see you tomorrow night.  Love you.
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy.
Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.
Yeah...I remember.  I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
No.  No.  Well, sort of.  In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
No.  Missing teenager.  Disappeared thirty years ago.  Found her bones last week.  Buried behind some old diner, up by Dyckman street.  Mary Finelli.
You have the right to speak to an att --
We were looking for something to keep our hands busy.  It was either this or an orgy.  Vera chose this.  What're ya gonna do?
I did?!  I broke the world's record.
I didn't mean it the way it sounded...
And Hell is hot, but I ain't goin' down there either.
Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
Just slow down.  Let me get to know you again.  Let me get to know this place again.
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
I'm here with you.  Can't that be enough for now?
In that little thing?
Why don't you help us?
May be please have the wallet.
Keep looking.
I just want you to like me.
You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
All he's asking is for you to check it out.
And make sure my daughter stays put...  ...She's grounded.
Hide it behind the gas station. Then we can get the hell out of here.
I hope so.
Are they grown-ups?
That's debatable.
We'll scare 'em right back.
All the little kids arrive today. We're not ready to deal with that alone.
Boy scouting.
Why not?  I used to play it alone. I love murder games.  Have you ever played The Consulting Detective?
They coulda danced a jig on it an' fed it to goats -- don't matter.  Ya' can't kill Jason by gettin' rid of his body.  He'll come back the way he always do, to drag the kiddies into the darkness and crush their little skulls -- maybe even your skull, Mr. Campbell.
-- look, just shut up.  Let's cut through the shit.  You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap.  One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
I'm scared.  I'm very scared.
That's it, we're done.
It's...It's all right.
Goddamnit!
Take him to my car.  I'll be out in a minute.
She's yours?
Next, you dial a number.
He was dead.  He had to be dead...
I know what it sounds like.
About Jessica.
I'm literally going to kill you!
No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
Really?
What are you going to do?
I guess not.
Nobody related to McCulloch can be nice.
She changed her mind.  Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are in two-twenty-five.
It's...dead.
She's locked safe in her room, no thanks to either of you.  Has he brought it back on course yet?
He's the son of the Captain, for Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able to operate this thing!
I don't think that's such a safe idea
I'm staying.
She didn't push me into coming.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
But Sean said...
Rennie, you're the best student I ever had...you have a real gift. If anybody can make use of that pen, it's you.
I want to go home. I want off this ship.
Ruptured steam pipe.
Do not inhale.
I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.
That's where I peed.
Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.
She wants a divorce.
It's just a review.
I recite it to myself with masochistic relish.
It's your best play, Nicky.
`The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.'  I'm telling you as a friend.
There are things that speak to us from the past.
The Red Sox
The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?
Why do you need a radio?
Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
Names are incredibly intimate. We barely know each other. Trust me on this.
What else?
An artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before.
The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.
You're hurting my head.
Go way. I'll call a cop.
Right here. At the door.
I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.
Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?
The Red Sox are your problem. I never understood about you and the Red Sox. Everybody rooted for the Yankees.
It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
I can't find it.
I'll go get you another one. You have to wear it.
Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
Speak it like it's real. Matthew.
No. They're not your team. They're my team.
But I know you, don't I? I seen you on a poster in the theater district. I'll think of your name in just a --
I was educated by nuns.
But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines.
I kissed her while she was laughing.
Yes.
I think I remember.
So do I. Over and over.
I don't know.
Where are you going now?
Never mind.
I haven't come to you.
Mr. Khan said they called you brave.
Yes. I've -- I've met some very remarkable people in India... and -- and when I read what you've been doing here, I -- I wanted to help.  Does that surprise you?
Well, we shall try.
Going nearer to God!
I think you do.  But I thank God we all don't.
He's waiting. He's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think.
Wait and see... wait and see...
That the fighting will stop -- that you make me believe it will never start again.
Good.  Ba will have to teach you to spin too.
No... no. In every temple and mosque they have pledged to die before they lift a hand against each other.
I --
I mean a day of prayer and fasting. But of course no work could be done -- no buses, no trains, no factories, no administration. The country would stop.
I can. But I risk being kicked into the gutter by someone less "holy" than Mr. Baker.
Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
I -- I will write to the press -- here -- and in England.  And I will use the courts.
Somehow I expected not.
No -- but I think I'm going to.
...an eye for an eye making the whole world blind.
Who are you trying to convince?
Now is your chance to find out.
Er, no...
Don't worry.  You'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb.  We can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.
Not yet, I'm afraid.
I guess I'm a slow learner.
I'll see what I can do.
This is a murder investigation.  The public should be happy to co-operate, to get this disease off the streets.
A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
A man can change his face--but blood is forever. Sample every employee within the parameters I gave you.  Intravenous.
I'll take it out of your damn <i>pension</i> if you question my authority one more time!
We'll vacuum these streets if we have to.
You're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst.
What's wrong with him?
Suit yourself.
A day or so.
You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since.
She doesn't <i>have</i> to know.  She doesn't <i>want</i> to know.
I have to caution you it's not fool-proof. With multi-gene traits there can be no guarantees.
Why not?
Not that.
They said the same thing about myopia and obesity.  You think your children would be less human if they were less violent, angry, spiteful?  Maybe they'd be <i>more</i> human.  From where I sit the world could stand a little improving.
Were <i>you</i> alone?
Why would we do that?
I have better things to do this week than answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot. Don't you?
Nothing yet.  I'll start experiencing symptoms in my late-fifties.  But unless they come up with something between now and then, I won't live much past 67.
You've never been here?  Let me order for you.
New policy.
I get my own help.
I heard about you. You work with Miller.
You know, you and I may be two of a kind.
No applause!
One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million.
A little more was taken out before.  My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts.
So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
Hi.
Just like old times?
Boring.
I'm still here, Doc.
It's all right.
I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.
Want to cry now?
I feel like the night before the first day of school.
I know you do. But it is different.  It's different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.
Do it my way.
What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore?
And switched keys.
Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.
I'll tell you something, Doc. One day you're going to have to trust somebody...
El Paso.
Not now.
Listen to me. It's hard enough.
We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
You and me.
Can we make it?
Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem, right near Salt Lake ... Say, you wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would you?
Yeah. I got out.
I kinda doubt it.
That's what I want.
Don't worry about me, I'll grab a cab... I can afford it, you know.
That right?
That's what matters, isn't it?
I got a nurse in mind.
Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
A couple of weeks back.
Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.
Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.
This is my brother's car.
You're a big man, but you're in bad shape. With me, it's a full- time job. Now behave yourself.
Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits.
That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank?  What happens if I miss the train?
Brumby!
Yes. I can't help the way I am.
Once a week you like a gentleman?
He wanted me to leave Dave and marry him. Last Friday I told him it wouldn't work. Dave would have killed us both!  He followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street,  I had to tell Frank I couldn't see him any more. It was getting too dodgy. That was on Sunday.  He said he'd kill himself. I was frightened what you might do.
Yes, I do.
Yes, while he was here.
He was here for four days.
Nasty.
Expect so.
Come off it. Frank was... well... straight. He had no worries I know. Hell, we worked together every day for a year. It would have showed.
It just would. He was always the same.
Where would I find him?
That's what he was saying about you.
I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a course in karate.
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
No, you won't.
Stick the soft soap. Let's be having it.
Ta-ra.
What you going to do?
What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?
What's that supposed to mean?
Piss off, Ray.
You're bluffing, you bastard!
That's what you pay to find out. Right, Jack?
You missed a fucking sale.  Big deal.  A deadbeat Polack.  Big deal. How you going to sell 'em in the first place...?  Your mistake, you shoun'a took the lead.
The whole fuckin' thing...The pressure's just too great.  You're ab...you're absolu...they're too important.  All of them.  You go in the door.  I..."I got to close this fucker, or I don't eat lunch," "or I don't win the Cadillac..." We fuckin' work too hard.  You work too hard.  We all, I remember when we were at Platt...huh?  Glen Ross Farms... didn't we sell a bunch of that..."
They came in and they, you know...
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
It is.
It's too...
You get a bad month, all of a...
No.
I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years.
That's right?
Eh?
...that's right...
Nurses.
He made up those rules, and we're working for him.
Look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no.  No.  You're absolutely right, and I want to tell you something.
I want to tell you what somebody should do.
Yes...?
You haven't talked to him.
No, we're just...
As an idea.
Did you talk to Graff?
What did he say?  He'd buy them.
You have to steal the leads tonight?
They come to you, you going to turn me in?
Why would they come to me?
No.
Then listen to this: I have to get those leads tonight.  That's something I have to do.  If I'm not at the movies...if I'm not eating over at the inn...If you don't do this, then I have to come in here...
Me?
Why?
I don't...yes.  Okay, the board.
Well, they're old.  I saw the shit that they were giving you.
Yes.  They are old.
Down the street.
The cops?
No.
You think so?
I'm sure that we're insured, George... 
Go to lunch, will you...
Where does he get off to talk that way to a working man?  It's not...
Moss...Who told him?
Levene!
Anyone in this office lives on their wits...  I'm going to be with you in a second.  What you're hired for is to help us--does that seem clear to you? 
Get in the goddamn room.
All that I'm saying...
The premium leads.  Yes.  I know what they cost.  John.  Because I, I generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them.  Nineteen senny-nine, you know what I made? Senny-nine?  Ninety-six thousand dollars.  John?  For Murray... For Mitch...look at the sheets...
The...Shelly?  The hot leads are assigned according to the board.  During the contest. Period.  Anyone who beats fifty per...
That's fucked.  That's fucked.  You don't look at the fucking percentage. You look at the gross.
I'm out.
What if you don't?  Then I'm fucked. You see...?  Then it's my job. That's what I'm telling you.
Fuck that.  That's defeatist.  Fuck that.  Fuck it...Get on my side. Go with me.  Let's do something. You want to run this office, run it.
Because I say so.
That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I'd like something off the other list.  Which, very least, that I'm entitled to.  If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am.  What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you.
That's alright.
The deal still stands, our other thing.
The leads are coming.
Why should the sale not stick? Hey, fuck you.  That's what I'm saying.  You have no idea of your job.  A man's his job and you're fucked at yours.  You hear what I'm saying to you?  Your "end of month board..." You can't run an office. I don't care.  You don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls.  You ever been on a sit?  Ever?  Has this cocksucker ever been...you ever sit down with a cust...
Mmm.
Yes.  Mmm.  Yes.  Precisely. Precisely. 'Cause your partner depends on it.  I'm talking to you, I'm trying to tell you something.
You're so full of shit.
How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?
Five thousand.  I kept half.
I...what?  Are you, are you, that's why...?  Are you nuts?  I'm...I'm going to close for you, I'm going to...  Here, here, I'm going to make this office...I'm going to be back there Number One...Hey, hey, hey!  This is only the beginning...List...list... listen. Listen.  Just one moment. List...here's what...here's what we're going to do.  Twenty percent. I'm going to give you twenty percent of my sales...  Twenty percent.  For as long as I am with the firm.  Fifty percent.  You're going to be my partner.  Fifty percent.  Of all my sales.
"...You look around, you say, 'This one has so-and-so, and I have nothing..."
...Shut up.  Decide who should be dealt with how?  Is that the thing? I come into the fuckin' office today, I get humiliated by some jagoff cop.  I get accused of...I get this shit thrown in my face by you, you geniune shit, because you're top name on the board...
Hey, big fucking deal.  Broke a bad streak...
They took the phones...
Yes.  I did.  This morning.  What I'm saying to you: things can change.  You see?  This is where you fuck up, because this is something you don't know.  You can't look down the road.  And see what's coming.  Might be someone else, John.  It might be someone new, eh?  Someone new.  And you can't look back. 'Cause you don't know history.  You ask them.  When we were at Rio Rancho, who was top man?  A month...?  Two months...? Eight months in twelve for three years in a row.  You know what that means?  You know what that means? Is that luck?  Is that some, some, some purloined leads?  That's skill. That's talent, that's, that's...
Kenilw...
Yes.  Is this something that I can talk ab...
Ah.  Ah, his wife is.  Ray: what time do you have...?
Didn't I say I was taking the two o'...
Did I...?
What do I...?
James.  I'm glad to meet you.  I'm glad to meet you, James.  I want to show you something.  It might mean nothing to you...and it might not. 
But we have to before Monday.  To get our money ba...
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
What was the earliest it could have been cashed?
I just called downtown, and it's on their desk.
No.  She told me "right now."
No, Jim.
What...?
What are the police doing here...?
Harriet and blah blah Nyborg.
Your farewell to the troops?
They--excuse me...
Aren't you going out today?
I have the stuff from last year's...
I got lots of presents.
Do you like them?
I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
No.  He would give it away.  I know how to repay a consideration.
The children can stay.
I just had a drive; besides, I want to see my brother-in-law Michael.
Yeah, but I don't want him to see you.
He's the head of the family.
You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner.  Don't be afraid to tell them.  Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things.  Let yourself be guided by him.  He has more experience in these matters.
My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.
I didn't turn against nobody; he turned against me.
You remember Willy Cicci, don't you, Freddie?  We was all together with the old man Clemenza in Brooklyn... before...uh...
Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother.
It wasn't the way I wanted it!  I can handle things.  I'm not dumb Christ, not like everyone says. I'm smart; and I want respect.
For you, she is beautiful.  For me, there is only my wife!
What?
Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.
Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad.
Kay... Kay...
What the hell does that mean?  Come on, Tom, speak out straight once in your life.  I know Michael can't, but you're not Sicilian, you can tell a woman the truth; you can treat her like an equal, a fellow human being.
Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a stroke but he's recovered okay. Bussetta's dead.
My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth assured him nothing would happen to you.
Wait... there's something else.
That plane goes to Miami...
I don't like it when you use the word impossible; nothing is impossible...
I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.
I'm staying.  Don't ever enjoy the cruel part of all this; Sonny never listened to me about that.  Now, explain everything to me.
No questions.
He's going to try Panama...
Yeah.  He wouldn't even go out to dinner.  Just wanted to go home.
Yeah, I still read a lot.  They bring me stuff.
Very well.
Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
Kay, I told you...
Who's asking?
Who do you think you're talking to?
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
Jake, Jake, come over here.  Mike, I want you to meet Jake Cohen; he manages the casino for us.
So?
Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched.
They feel cheated.
In my home!  In the same room where my wife was sleeping; where my children come in their pajamas, and play with their toys.
Then why do you want me to lay down to them?
This was my father's old study. When I was a kid, we had to be quiet when we played near here. When I was older, I learned many things from him here.  I was happy that this house never went to strangers; first Clemenza took it over, and then you.  My father taught me, in this room, never to act until you know everything that's behind things.  Never.  If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded with you in the Rosato Brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still sound.  I'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We have friends in some very important business that we're making.  Do this for me; you make the peace with the Rosato Brothers on their terms.  Let the word out that I forced you; you're not happy wit hit, but acquiesced, just because of me.  It will get back to Hyman Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can trust me.
No sign of them yet; but they're still on the Estate.
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
You want a war?
That's a lucky C note for our new deal.
You liked it too.
What are you then?  What will you be ten years from now?  Still cutting lawns?  Still banging horny divorcees in your trailer?
You will not hurt him?
You do that.
The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch.  I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I ask.
You did not know?
Well...no, not really --
Maybe.  But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go?
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
This and that.  The only ones you maybe have heard of are the "Frankenstein" pictures.
You mean -- you really want to draw me?
Oh if it's going to make you uncomfortable...  Perhaps we can find something else for you to wear.
That's exactly what I intend to do.
Did you now?
Why?  Was it supposed to be funny?
Proud?  Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
No.  I could have, though.
Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon?
Sorry.  I don't feel like sitting still today.
You ever been married, Mr. Whale?
What way might that be?
Sorry.  Not today.
I'm fine.  I'd just rather keep it on.
Suppose we unbutton the top and pull it down around your shoulders? Two buttons.  Is that so much to ask?  Just two little buttons.
How long were you...?
Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?
No harm done.
You don't want me to sit for you anymore?
Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.
Good.  Let's get dry.
Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear me calling?
That's from your movie, right? "The only monsters are here."
Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect.
It's too tight.
Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.
You're crazy.
Hasta la vista, Boone.  And give the jail bait a squeeze for me.
It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --
I was, until last night.  Publicity asked me to fly Miss Taylor in for today's reception.
That's what I'm trying to explain.
Boris?  Do I look a fright?
I'm fine, Jimmy.  I can only stay a few minutes.
Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.
Oh shut up.  All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him.
After you then.
But it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
He's one of the great images of the twentieth century.  As important as the Mona Lisa.
Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale.
Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley...
Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke."
You have a Hollandaise sauce ?
My version of "take this job and shove it..."
I could kill you. That occurred to me. When I first heard about this. That I would kill you ...
I hope you know what you're doing. God help you if you don't ...
Get out of here, then. Now.
You know my back.
I don't think so, Detective ...
You know my back.
Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ?
It's all microchips and shit ...
How you doing, man?
Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this about anyways -- ?
He didn't mess up. There it is ...
He's in some trouble ...
You remember that, Kip?
We'll take it.
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
You all right -- ?
Yeah --
"Over--"  You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--
Not really ... But you know... Maybe I'm wrong ...
You hear me?
"Shadow games?"
I'm cool.
That's a good attitude, Kip. For everything but stealing cars ...
She's for sale. They're asking forty thousand. Give 'em sixty ...
What are you doing here?
Mitch.
Six or seven...
If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ...
She was the only "Annie" you could find?
No ...
Oh. Okay. Right.
A little trick I picked up at the Car Thief Retirement Home ...
"Unlock my button" ... ?
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
Are you considering a comeback tour?
"A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them..." Nietzsche said that.
I Just don't know how happy they'll be to see me
He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.
Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up
The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?
Don't go busting my balls. Okay?
No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.
Me? Why would I get into that shit?
Anybody!  You understand?
But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
Liar!
I thought you were going to stand me up. You looked bored. You didn't say anything. What did you expect. Tommy was all over me. Right?
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
It'll be okay.
Who's gonna do that?
I got seared.
If Paulie finds out, we got problems.
Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
I better call again.
Right away I knew he didn't want them. I knew I was going to get stuck for the money. I only bought the damn guns because he wanted them. And now, he didn't want them. I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was so pissed he didn't even say goodbye.
He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all.  On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck.
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
Will you stop.
He heard.
Whadda you mean, you can't make any more deliveries? You're going to fuck up everything?
I gotta go home and get my hat.
There's a shovel at my mother's.
No. It's okay. Just watch this. Watch it.
Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.
They won't be left back. They'll stay in their grade.
You think that matters?  You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.
I'm sorry, 'cause you know Mikey, the fuckin guy loves animals, and this is the last person you'd want this to happen to.
That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him.
Suck my cock!
What are we gonna do up there?
Fuck you.
I don't know yet.
Don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. WILL I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta the way.
Sorry, brother.  I don't know what to tell ya. You know all the girls I been with. You been with 'em too, except for Cheryl McGovern which was a big mistake on your part brother...
Chuckie, what are you talkin'...
Yeah, I figured now that you got your big job over in Cambridge, you needed some way to get over there and I knew I wasn't gonna drive you every day...
See ya' Chuckie. I had fun.
I really don't know what to say. Look, I lie to women all the time. That's just my way.  Last week Morgan brought these girls down from Roslindale. I told them I was a cosmonaut. They believed me. But Will's not usually like that--
What do you mean "your sandwhich?" I bought it.
Shut up.
Yah, that was different. Management was restructurin'--
I don't have a VCR at my house.
Shut the fuck up.
Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo?
Will you take a check?
How'd you like that course?
History? Just "history?" It must have been a survey course then.
Seven.
Really?
Yes. Under two conditions.
Yeah, when do I get my hypnosis? You guys been talkin' for twenty minutes.
It's right.  Take it home with you.
Then don't set up any more meetings.
Sure, then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk. Think of how many fights you could have been in by now.
I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
I know. We just couldn't wait 'till Monday to find out.
Who proved the theorem.
Is there someplace we can talk?
Not much free time, Gerry. LAMBEAU Have you ever heard of a man named Ramanujan?
He was alive over a hundred years ago. He was Indian. Dots, not feathers...
Tom.
Look, I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.
--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.
--And who do you think he's handling? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. And for 20 years he's been alone because of that. And if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again. And I'm not going to let that happen to him!
--I don't have any anger at you--
I don't blame you! It's not about that! It's about the boy! 'Cause he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him-- I won't see you make him feel like a failure too!
He won't be a failure!
You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself!
He's not you!
What do you want to do?
Who is he?
Hold up.
Like what, Will?
I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.
Watch your mouth.
You've never been out of Boston.
Yeah, I went on a date last week.
Fine.
So Christ, call her up.
You ever think about gettin' remarried?
What? Do I wonder if I'd be better off if I never met my wife?
What?
That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.
That's right. And you fuckin' lost! And some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again!
Do you want to talk about it?
It's not your fault.
Good for you. Congratulations.
Only if you grab my ass.
I'm Will.
Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.
Okay, you got me. It's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser who got drunk and wouldn't leave you alone all night.
Then why don't we just get it out of the way.
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
You should have called. I have an "O- chem" lab due tomorrow and it's impossible.  It's not an excuse dummy. I want to go out with you. But look:
How the hell did you do that?
Exactly.
What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?
Want me to take a look?
I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
I don't know. I just feel it.
Well, I'm contracting the land.
Sure! I was just aimin' to meet up with a couple girls I know.
That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before.
Don't hold me so tight.
That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.*
Oh.
Lots must a died, too.
Gallon or two?
Cut me off a hunk a that banana cream, and a cuppa java.
Women?
Why, I guess so.
We don't need a warrant if it's a riot.
Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here?
Government.
Can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.
Ma's shore gonna like it here. She ain't been treated decent for a long time.
Crate fell on me.
Been out travelin' around?
It's hard to say. Stay here till mornin' an' then go on over to Uncle John's, I reckon. After that I don't know.
Thought you was in jail.
But jus' the minute they ain't strike- breakin' they won't get no five!
Want to work, do you?
Why don't you get to it, buddy?
What you mean?
If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
This here's a strike.
No, ma'am. They ain't no work hereabouts. Pa's in tryin' to sell some stuff to get gas so's we can get along.
You mean I can't even get outa here?
But will it--hurt the baby?
Stand by the door.
I know, honey, an' just as soon as we get settled Al's gonna set out an' look for him. How 'bout gas, Tommy?
Pa! Shh!
They charge extry at the comp'ny store but they ain't no other place.
We *got* to, Tommy. But that's gonna be awright. I seen the han'bills, about how much work they is, an' high wages, too. But I gotta fin' out somepin' else first, Tommy.  Did they hurt you, son? Did they hurt you an' make you mean-mad?
Don't taste bad.
Since before they stopped us las' night.
I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am.
No. That's all. You made a dollar, an' that's a dollar's worth.
I'm sorry, Ma. But--I didn't know what I was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it.
Comes night we'll get outa here.
Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier.
Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
Sure. Good-by.
I shore would like to do that, ma'am, but the fack is, we ain't got but a dime for it. It's all figgered out, I mean--for the trip.
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
There, them stripy ones.
Well, give me two then, ma'am.
I know that! But *where* they gone?
Some say I am.  You want to hear what happened?
It ain't nobody. It's a company.
Brother, I don't know. If I did I'd tell you. But I just don't know *who's* to blame!
Easy. After all, they ain't but about *twelve* of us, is they?
Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.
You're tootin' we're gonna stay. 
Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
Lissen. You done busted it. You hear?  But lissen here. I won't tell nobody, y'understan'?
Well, there's plenty of work for you about forty miles north, this road just outside Pixley. Turn east on 32 and look for Hooper's ranch. Tell 'em Spencer sent you.
Awright. An' if she gets outa han', I'll be in the right han' corner, this side the dance floor.
I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
It's what I do.
I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
Fine, Bob. How are you?
I want to be an actor.
It's nice to see you again.
Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word?
I'm a professional killer.
Uh, no. So you're back now, a decade later, and you want to sort things out with me. The question now is, do I allow you... access... to my being?
It's always the little things.
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
Okay... Hold on...
I'll just help myself to a cocktail.
Yes.
Is it something you've done?
That's because I speak human, and you speak monster.
I just know.
I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens."  So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families.
So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.
What stuff?
Morality.
That's it then. That's it. I've always been alone. That's why I'm a good driver. I can handle it. See, I can think on my feet. I survive, I'm a thinker. And I can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me. Some people can't do it! Some people are ranting and raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car, I can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna go? You're gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night. You ain't going nowhere. You leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening. What's the big deal, right?
Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
Okay.
Because your problem is you're bored. And you have a very big mind.  I am part of what I call a brain syndicate.
Is that right?
Nope.
I guess.
Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though.
In Portugal, yes.
I don't think so.
It was the PLO.
Good. For a second there I thought we were in trouble.
Patch him through....
In Detroit. This weekend.
There's nothing to be done about it.
Good. What else? Anything interesting?
I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
Mein Dealer.
I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek.
Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the same old sell-out baby-boomer, exploiting the oppressed I got shot for at Kent State. But why don't we have a drink and forget the whole thing?
Plenty of signs -- just none of them printed. Who do I get the idea you're not just passing through!
Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain.
A jogger, huh?
OK. I'll stop talking then.
Feel good?
Huh?
The point was to love each other.
It's still early. What's your next class?
Doesn't matter.
I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
Oh. You didn't tell me.
What are you asking me for? You didn't ask me if I wanted to come in the first place -- now I get to decide? Forget it!
No, you just act like you do.
What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."
What are you talking about?
I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --
NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.
Well, now you know what it feels like.
FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!
Yeah, well, you've done a great job.
LEAVE ME ALONE!!
I said... I started.
My period.
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
Riding with Judith.
Yeah. Bye.
No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
I had to excuse myself from a meeting. It's ridiculous. I kept thinking about the baby... you... and, I swear, I was going to start bawling right into my briefs.
Aw... that's so sweet.
Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.
I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way...
I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave...
I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.
Well, it's good that you're there.
Night.
Everything all right.
Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark.
Well, get born a bull, got a ninety percent chance of getting castrated and served up as hamburger. On a balance I reckon I'd choose being a cow.  Would you mind passing that salad young lady?
Well, I know Peterson's. Old place is as good as falling down around your ears.
Absolutely. I made enough for an army.
Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.
Always did. I think she favored him a little. You tend to when you have more than one, even though you love 'em all the same.
Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to.
Oh God, Annie, I'm so sorry. I... I know you're being hit with a low now, I don't want to take too much of your time but I have to talk to you about Pilgrim.
It isn't right to make him suffer...
What?
We should be fine, then.
Our daddy raised Pure Herefords.
Uh, I'm Tom Booker. Your mother around?
I don't have all day.
Not a question of if you can -- you are. Just keep your eyes on the road and your foot on the pedal and the rest will take care of yourself.
I know you do. Don't you disappear.  You do whatever you have to, to hold on...  I'll tell you one more thing... When Pilgrim reared up to face that truck... you know what I think?... I think that damn horse loved you so much, he was trying to protect you... That's what I think.
Can I come? I'll start a fire...
I'm okay... I'm okay.
No, not yet.
OK, OK.
I know. Amazing.
I don't any woman in New York. But from what I hear, most of them are wound up.
Where did you learn all this stuff?
Alright sir.
Waste the dude.
I want it.
Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
Looks like a hacker wrote it.
Yo, hit the lights.
Go fix the phones.
Dead?
Yeah, mom?
How did you know that?
Yeah?
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
Yeah.
Name your stakes.
Okay, thank you.
Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
Right, and at this rate it ends its run in...
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches on it... lets my computer talk to the one there...
However, we have come to believe that one Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus. He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We want you to help us find it.
You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.
Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.
Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.
Excuse me?
Well luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer. I traced the hacker's call. The secret service picked him up this morning. I'll just search his files for the original virus code, and then I can eliminate it.
Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...
Not everything. But enough to implicate us.
Yeah. To civilians. But they're hackers. But don't worry. All we have to do is launch the Da Vinci virus, and then they'll all be put away.
No one believes the guilty. Besides, by the time they realize the truth, we'll be long gone with all of our money.
"Minor glitch" with you seems to turn into a major catastrophe.
So?
Get back!
Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.
Can't you find somebody else?
Why not?
I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet.
How many bodies did you find?
Police station. I ain't closing down with out a good goddamn reason.
I don't want to.
You bet.
What?
Coming.
I thought you said you were ready.
Real soon, Jamie. Now shh.
Come on.
Then we'll be safe?
No.
Why?
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.
You won't come on too strong.
Ben-uh-I just heard about the station.
What are we doing?
Got it Ben.
Maybe you ought to wait here till they do.
Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...
Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.
Myers has been locked up since before she was born. He's never laid eyes on her.
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
He's been here.
Dear God.
Right through the kitchen you'll see the basement stairs.  Brady, you know how to use a gun?
Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?
All right Rachel, you stay by this radio. The state boys will send word once their in route. When that word comes you go tell deputy Logan.
Now you understand?
Don't touch him Jamie!
What happened?
Huh?
We just talked.
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating.
I have a place for that.
That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.
The guys think I'm too smart.
I've already lost it.
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
I'd say you must have the wrong number.
I can't.
Okay. First I rip your clothes off...
Go get me a beer.
I thought you were gonna get one for me.
Will you call me tomorrow?
Lee Brackett.
Looks like to me you're just plain scared.
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
I think you have too much to do tomorrow.
Totally.
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
See you.
Laurie, what's the Boogey Man?
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.
There WAS.
The bogyman!
You're coming with us...
She's washing her clothes.
Well, go tell her it's me, okay?
You must have told them we shocked him into a grinning idiot. Two roadblocks and an all-points bulletin wouldn't stop a five-year-old!
Your compassion is overwhelming, Doctor.
Only minimum security.
I couldn't if I tried.
I don't think this is any time to be funny...
He said something else. "It's all right now. He's gone. The evil's gone."
I mean, I've looked everywhere.
No, really, we mustn't get discouraged.
Mmm.
Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba.  That, I wasn't such a big hit.
Oh, is that what it is?
Yeah.
Uh...
Hmm?
Do you remember that summer in France?  Hannah, you had jet lag for six straight weeks.
Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?
Really?  Is the food that bad?
Oh no.  Not at all.
Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
Well...
Right.  Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?
Yes.
Like what?
Yeah.  It's kind of a weird place, actually.  A lotta wall space. 
Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
Are you okay?  You look-- You're sweatin'. ELLIOT  Yeah.  Yeah, I just-just need so- some-some fresh air.  It's probably something I ate.  I'll-I'll walk. You go ahead.
Hi.
Yeah?
Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
Could you--
Oh, I don't know.  My unemployment checks are running out.  Um, I was thinking of taking some courses at Columbia with the last of my savings.
Oh.  Well, I live--
Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
Oh, right.
Did you ever read this one--?
Oh, please, I have to go.  I have to get my teeth cleaned.
I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone.  I was so torn when you called.
I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
I want you to take care of me... And I love when you do things to me.
If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
I care a great deal about him, yes.
Ohhh, but I've eaten five of these.
Mmm.
Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
But, you got four children!
You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured.  A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut.  I-it's all very...preconceived.
No!
No!  But you keep asking these, these awful questions.  My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!
Me?  Of course not. HANNAH There's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are so...personal they could only have come from you.
No.
Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke.
This is a toast.  You know this beautiful Thanksgiving dinner was all...
Yeah.
How can we be happy?
Absolutely.
Because he likes you.
I can't take this anymore.
Oh, you know what.  I'm suffocating!
What are you going to use for money?!
Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?
Stop accusing me!
So you met somebody else?
Well, he has to rule out certain things. 
I don't know.  Cancer, I--
No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.
Yeah...but you're not dying!
Well, I don't realize it now, I know it all the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind...
Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?
No.
Yes, but doesn't that ruin everything for you?  That makes everything...
I think they're fantastic.
Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all.
Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
Oh, now-- 
I got two minutes.
He's fine.
I like him.  I think he's a sweet guy.
H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
Go out, go out by the Sung vase and, and catch this.
You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
Now, Holly's not shy.
Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for our friends, so  we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties.
Someday, I'll pay it all back.
Two thousand dollars.
It's, uh, you never know--
I know, no--  I know.
Easily.
Look, everything's going your way.
You're too demanding.
Good.
Take...take a year.  Take six months.  Whatever you want.  Who knows?  Maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play.
That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
No!
Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you!  I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you.  Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  I don't know where you went, went wrong.
...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
You look wonderful.
Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?
You've always hated my taste in the past.
I'm not anymore.  I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year.
Hmm.  I think it's lucky I ran into you.  Maybe.
Oh.  You look so beautiful.
Hmm.
...read it over, and think about it.
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
Lechter's not buying up his Memorabilia. He keeps it all in his "mind," do you see...?
Let's keep it to business, shall we?
Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.
I'm not.
You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
M'I gonna see you tonight?
...nightmare.
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.
Yes, but we know who it was, and I will tell you, Agent Starling, what you know to be true.  I offered the bounty.  It was illegal, and, worse, it was <u>wrong</u>. And I thank God every day that I did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder.  Do you  Agent Starling:  do you know <u>God</u>? 
Show me the Pigs.
Follow Starling, stake out Starling. Increase the pressure on Starling.  He will come to her.
Good evening, Dr. Lechter.  Thank you for coming.  I am sorry that we could not meet under more pleasant circumstances.
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
Mmm...
And I expect you to.  Let's talk like two medical men 
Come on, stay with us.  Look here:  I could get behind you, and give you a <u>spinal</u>, tomorrow, you wuunt feel <u>anything</u> down there, a l'il <u>pulling</u> is all.  N'I'll tell you <u>what</u>, after he's got his jollies, ten, f'teen minutes, I'll come down here, give you a shotta <u>this</u>  stop your heart, an that's <u>you</u> done, an there's an <u>end</u> to it.  What do you say...?  I know you got lotsa money, evabody says so.  I know how that stuff works, take it out, move it <u>around</u>...  ...stay with me now, <u>fuss</u> with it... Whatsay we call your banker now, tell him a <u>code</u>... move that money to me, he <u>confirms</u> it, and I fix you up Right Now...  Whatsay?
....what...? 
..I was <u>instructed</u> that this was a Joint Task Force, the FBI, BATF, and the Mayor's Special...
...standard issue...
We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the Justice Department.
I'm going to work for your reinstatement...
Well, you know, that happens, on the street.
Evone tells me:  I shoulda been in, fi, six, months ago.... thizz my first checkup.
It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
That, that was <u>business</u>...
And you have a new wedding ring on yours? <u>La Vita Nuova</u>?-- 
My scar is a war-wound.
Enchante.
She my foster.
...and Shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.
Is it necessary to know?
You were given backup....
...and my need for The Institution...
...you have to <u>eat</u>...
You don't wish to <u>beg</u>...?
...after you' re dead.  AND WHEN I GIVE THE WORD, do you understand...when I give the <u>word</u>...
What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
Because, baby, you're looking to find love in an institution, that's your only chance....
Show'm the FBI <u>Hand</u>shake...
You goin to shoot yourself? 
Cause I'm tired, cleaning up after you.  Why dontcha gimme the gun?
...get me a cigarette.
I know where he is.
I know something no one knows.  He has had his finger removed.  On his left hand.  It left a scar. 
...but:  this particular statue...
And what does <u>that</u> mean?
...yes, yes, yes....
...<u>barter</u> with her.  To appeal to her, and you feel that...
Yes.
I don't understand.
That if <u>decision</u> were a useful tool, you wouldn't <u>be</u> here.  Why are you here...?
...yes...?
Yes.
<u>Someone</u> offered three million dollars bounty on Dr. Lechter's head. 
I can be a good pig. Babe. Charlotte's Web. Good pig. Watch.
"Why?" If I asked questions like that, I'd never make love-"love"-- Damn you, Damn this, damnit!
That doesn't make me feel better! Why are you being like this?
Don't raise your voice at--I gave you the ultimate male fantasy--sex, nothing on the side. Don't pretend we shared anything other than fluids.
Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?
You guys have been so colossal...
Wichita--you're everybody's type. But seriously, don't worry about it. I get my occasional crushes.
Goodnight.
Stop, stop...I'm willing to put my mouth where my mouth is...I throw one overhand pass and Todd catches it-- dramatic pause--You let me go down on you...
That wants to be a Yes.
Nothing.
We need more ritalin. Can't we just grind it into the munchkins' food?
Talia, just because you happen to be Jewish, doesn't mean you can make fun of someone desecrating the Lord's body...
I just never thought of you in that...

Do you really think I care?
Be nice. Her father died in that TWA flight the government shot down...You know I'm going to be in the city next week.

Not now, Wendy.
You did last night.
Oh yeah, that's it.
I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
Very very. The photographs?
Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...
Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on.
People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
Yeah, I just got back.
Yeah, where's your urge to purge?
That's the stupidest question I've ever heard.
My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? "Bringing every State to a Higher State."
Killing her won't solve anything.
Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.
Our love is God. Let's get a Slurpee.
You can't be serious? Hey listen, my Bonnie-and-Clyde days are over.
Neat. Let's try it out on J.F.K.
Did to.
Don't <u>even</u> talk about that stuff!
Wha-at? Come on, there's another T.V. in the kitchen. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
This knife is filthy.
What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils?
You didn't say Simon Says.
You're not listening. People are going to look at the ashes of Westerburg and say there's a school that self-destructed not because society didn't care, but because that school <u>was</u> society. Is that deep or what? I'll let you put it in your diary, babe. Free of charge.
I thought I...you..
Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria have a No Fags Allowed Rule?
I think so, man.
Where is he? Where's J.D.?
We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
We're pretty handy with model making, too, eh?
She says Juliet's in a terrible state . . .
Well? Tell us! How'd it go?
Her parents won't be going overseas now . . . they'll have to cancel their trip. Don't worry about Juliet.
From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.
Well, I guess I take after you then!
You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing!
These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.

stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.
Of course it matters! It's Mario!
That idiot boarder?
You mean travel by ourselves?
Just a couple more . . .
Yes . . .
Let's go for a walk down here . . . come on, Mummy!
I miss her. I miss my wife.
Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
I understand, I think. Other women?
Did I ever talk about the accident?
No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
As much as he feels like. Its a much more pleasurable line of work.
Someone special.
We were gonna be millionaires you said. Nobody'd suspect a thing. I had never even met her. No connection. Then you went and had that fucking car accident.
Have we met?
How many zeros was your wife worth?
No, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. That's cold.
What?
In a word? Lucrative.
What?
It's perfect.
No please make yourself at home.
Where is she? Where is my wife?
Well they'd have to prove it in a court of law for one thing-
Wow you are out of it.  
This game is over do you hear me?
I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
Wow. Let's see. So many sins so little time. For starters I was responsible for the death my wife who by the way was carrying my unborn child. That was so I could collect her eight million dollar estate. I think I killed several women I was having mindless sex with behind her back.
Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
What do you mean?
I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.
Well now there's a compliment.
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
WHAT?!
Nah, I fucked it up.  I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why.  I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard.  He musta blew up.  I got the hell outta there.  I didn't have the nerve to face the kid.
In bad weather, yeah.  Mostly I camp out in the woods.  I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up.
Hey, do I look crazy?  I don't go for that shit... interviews, media. They're manipulators.  "Keep a low profile," that's my motto.
Jail!  Listen, Bubber...  This is crazy.  We could fall off of here.
Yeah, and with me it was like I was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine.
Yeah, I been calling in sick.  They think I got the flu.
How recently?
TAXI!  HEY, TAXI!  Well, at least I'm gonna get my goddamn million bucks.  TAXI FOR CHRISSAKE!
You mean John Bubber?
Business thing.  Gimme a seven and seven, willya?
When I was a kid, I thought I was gonna be this fantastic wonderful heroic human being.
It's a character thing, Bernie. I mean, you wouldn't do it.  No offense.  Me neither.  I mean, a guy like Bubber, he's a certain kinda guy.  Heroic.  You and me, we're not... heroic.  It's not our nature. It don't mean we're bad or nothing. We're just not so inclined.  What about it?
Bill, I got some legal problems and I...
It's never your fault, Bernie! Never ever!  You screwed up my life, now you're gonna screw up Joey's life, but you're never gonna accept responsibility for anyth--
Maybe not,... but you let him believe it!  And then I gotta explain about the homeless...
Turn that thing off.
How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?  Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...
-- saved your...  whaaaaaaat?  What? Blackmailing...?
In all that smoke and fire, John had a moment of weakness.  He'd been down and out, destitute, living in his car.  It was just an impulse, stealing my purse.
Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
What picture?
JOEY!
Mmmmm.  Well, it's complicated. Maybe when you're older.  Anyhow, what I'm gonna tell you here is in strict confidence, okay?  It don't go no further.  What happened is, you remember that night I was gonna take you to the movies an' it was raining like a sonofabitch, ..?
...unworthy of the adoration.  We all do.
Goodnight, John.
This guy LaPlante won an award?
And sold it to Mister LaPlante, the fence, who's now trying to blackmail poor John.
The story behind the story, the ugly scandal behind the falling millionaire, the dirt, you mean.
Listen, Gale, I know you're emotionally involved.  Don't be emotionally involved, be professional.  No, Gale, you are not a hardbitten, cynical hard-ass, you just think you are.  You are a goddamn cream puff!  Try and be a hard-ass!
Listen, Deak, what if Bubber <u>has</u> got something to hide?  What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?
The Presidency.  The public loves him.
I said I wished it had at least occurred to me to consider saving him.
An hour after...!  Deak, for Heaven's sake!  Let's give her a night in New York City.  We'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel...
"This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!"  Incredible. Unbelievable!  For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?  'Cause he stole <u>paint</u>?
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
Reporters don't have hormones?
Okay.
Oh, it's nothing.  No problem. I was really lucky to find this place.
I am.  I'm really feeling pretty good.  I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.
-- a sense of proportion.
Right.
I <u>know</u>.  I just feel that the relationship has reached that delicate stage where the slightest little thing could wreck the careful groundwork I've laid up till now.
I bet.  Going into people's homes.
Not me, I fell for it right down the line.  Be a good girl and believe all the fairy tales.  He married me because I was pretty.
Whew.
What's that?
High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
Honey, nobody buys a house overnight -- if someone else comes back at them, well, we might have to make a counter offer.  But we can't look too eager or we'll get screwed.
Oh -- great.
No.
Honey, I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having.  This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With <u>nothing</u>.
Did you lock the garage door?
C'mon.
This is my house.
Yeah -- we know him.  He's been hanging around the house.
Would you mind if Rudolf had a look too?
We'll get cable when the cable company is good and ready -- you think you can survive till then?
I didn't.
Rudolf?  C'mere, Rudolf!
Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
Well, technically it's not mid evil - - it's Renaissance.
Yes.
What is it?
That's what I figured.  Well, I have a little home coming present for you.
No.
Caution shows wisdom.
What?
That is what bothers me.
What do you think?
She's a treasure she is.
And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
Your life.
I cannot explain.
Do you love me, Conner?
Aye.
I remember you.
Yes.  We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland.
Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
Because it's my name.
I don't know anymore.
You remind me of someone I used to know.
It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book.
You look like you have.
Why?
Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about--
--the Calan.  Do you know who they are?
You don't really believe this do you?
How could that be?  People don't live for three hundred years.
Sounds very -- normal.
What's that next to him?
We'll see.
No.
It's not for me to decide.
Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.
I think he's dead!
Don't shout, Larry.  I'm three feet away.
I guess so.
It's me, Chief.  Can you talk?
Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang?
I took the call from Glen personally. They're still in Smith's house.
You won't die if you let me help.
<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
It's about Mars --
That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now come here and see this --
Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.
We had an awful lot of shooting.  You need a doctor in there?
I'm here.
I'm going to put on an officer named Will Maddox.  You talk to him for a while.
If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
Give up, Dennis.  Let these people go. At least you'll have your life.
Shut up and sit down.  You think someone's gonna make a house call?
<u>Look</u> at him!  I think he's dying!
You can't run with suitcases.
We don't have time!
They'll cut the power.
It won't be a problem.
Where is it?
If you shoot me, he'll kill your daughter.  Do you want to lose both of them?
Mine, too.
Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know.
I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.
Either I'm going to tie you or Mars will tie you.  Which do you want?
What are we going to do about Mike?
What's that, Chief?  Say again.
Go.
I couldn't find Jane.  She wasn't at the restaurant.
Stand by.
I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
And now I'm taking it back.  We're getting Smith out of the house.
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
Contact the landlord.  I want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy.
Special Agent Jones.
Thomas Smith.  I'm in the house that's on TV.  Dennis hit my dad and now he won't wake up.  You gotta help him.
I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
No!  They're right here --
How do I reach him?
We want them.  You will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks.
You want . . . Marlon and Al.
A delegation.
Excuse me?
No. I work at the Mille Collines.
Where is your family?
Have you requested re-enforcements?
What was the response?
Yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?
Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
Satellites?
The front gate would be best, General.
Business is good at the hotel?
For supplies, you drive.
I saw the sign.
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
Take it for Christ sake. I wish it was a fucking aeroplane.
Yes, sir. What is wrong?
No blood. As I left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me. I went to her house. She has the little girls. They are safe.
I will give you my house.
Of course.
Pack the bags, we have to move.
Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.
What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
What about us?
We're running out of beer and other supplies.
I'm not going alone. I'll take Gregoire with me. He's a good Hutu, and he wants to impress me now.
It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace.
What does it matter.
Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there.
Anais, it is so good to see you.
Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
That is why they call it coach?
As the trucks go.
No, I don't want you going on the street.
-- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr?
-- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --
-- the whole thing is falling apart!
Name's Pritchett. Watson Pritchett. I own the house, my father built it. And now I just need to get you into it. So...
Oh dear.
Yeah...something.
-- the "Saturation Chamber." Where he wanted to put me.
A very, very scary game. But then look at the bright side: if there's only one of you still upright at dawn, you'll be leaving here with five million dollars in your pocket.
I got an engraved -- literally -- invitation -- with my name --
Nonsense! Just bad press. All the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents.
Yes.
What?
It's not going to let us out!
Why not?
Sure, with three days and a blowtorch.
-- that's the fact, bud --
Better living through electricity.
-- was that??
It's succeeding!
Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.
I'm impressed: I don't think Evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia.
I'm not laughing, Steven.
You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!
Oh, I think we're going to have several.
Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? The "O.J." knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? Your "Jim Jones Kool- Aid" that was exactly that?
I know.
Really? Well, let it rip.
Funky little house, ain't it?  Friends, your hostess is now going to retire for what's left of the night. If you need me, I'll be in the bedroom upstairs -- but try and fight that need: the door'll be locked, I'll be trying to sleep, and if anyone so much as breathes in the keyhole, I'm gonna empty this thing into their fucking head. Thank you all for the bestest birthday a girl could have.
-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
Your roller coaster that is, quote: "unlike any that has ever come before it."
Absolutely. No cheap thrills. A genuine Journey To The Brink Of Madness.
Maybe if I --
I can't remember at the moment.
Oh, sorry. Detail I guess I forgot to mention. You die, you lose. Your check gets divvied-up by those still amongst the living.
Fascinated.
I'll take my chances.
Evelyn, go stir your cauldron or something for a sec.
So disengage his Flail Arm Mechanism and just make him a screamer.
-- it wasn't me.
I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
It better be -- he still owes me $25 grand for renting the place for the night! Here, let's get you some illumination so you can make your way safely!
Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?
-- ten.
Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
Keep talking, I'll find you!
The style of dress on the girl... it coincides with the era Marion Foster killed herself.  Who else could have gone in there and done something like that?
No, I live about in Wexford.  It's about a five hour drive.
Well, I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us.
A few years older, perhaps.
Maybe it was Colleen...
She talks to me.
I'm scared!
For good luck honey.
Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here...
Whatever you say.
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
I'm sure this sounds crazy to you.
Ok...
No.  You two are the most important things in my life.  I don't ever want to lose you.
I could see if I detect the presence of something.
What do you mean, unfortunately?
Maura.
Oh, that's nice...
Come back to us honey, don't be afraid!
Come back to us honey!
So what does that have to do with Aubrey!  Where is she!
I didn't do anything...God saved her...
I wish I had an answer.  Evil is powerful, more so every day it seems.  But I believe the worst for you and for this house is behind us.
So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
Not someone.  Something. I've never felt a presence that strong before.
Not really.  Oh, wait a minute.
What?
Correct.  The fields of France.  And many dead flowers ... Oh.  Forgive me. My name was Spenser.  Elliott Spenser. Captain.
And what did you discover?
This is his first night on Earth.  He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back.  He has to destroy it.
The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
What happened to him?
It's nothing to do with me.  I wasn't even with him.
What?
Oh, go on.  Have one.  Fuck it.  You think you're going to live forever?
The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
What on earth were you doing down here?
Help me pick 'em up, Terri.  I think the lady just made a sale.
Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
You're JP Monroe, right?
No.  Really?
Wow.  Thank you.
It has already begun.
What do you want?
Oh, I don't ...
C'mon.  It'll be great.
Sure.  Sure.  I understand.  It's cool. I mean, we've got all night.
Hudson, God's given you a gift for cat burglary, you can t just...
Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me."
Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo?
Hey, get this irritable guy a cappuccino.  I gotta go be a boss.
"And though he's slippery, he still gets caught."
What am I doing here?  There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy.
Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece. Da Vinci's "Sforza," an equestrian model of a never executed statue. I consider it to be the prize of tonight's auction of objets d'equestrian.  Horse things.
No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of <u>my</u> life.  What was your per-diem?
Why not just go now?
Get em....
It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.
Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....
No, your Eminence.  I think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week.
Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.
Anna, what are you trying to say...
I don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls.  And I buy my own clothes.  My life's a little boring...
I'll bring my entire repertoire...
It's also been a long time for me.  I--
Wha--
Does everyone in the world know more than me?  Jesus, I'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half.  Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved!
The C.I. what?  God, no...
You re not "some guy" anymore, Hudson.  Right now, you're the only guy.  Without your help, I....
Holy sh-h--things are going to get very interesting, very fast. Da Vinci would be proud of you.
Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some "neat" things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you're part of the same car pool.
Million five, lover...
But you're going to tell us anyway...
The pleasure's all yours, Officer Gates.
Alchemy.
Except yours-yours.  The goal of world domination.  Well, if you put it that way, Minnie.  How can I resist?
Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about ever'thing, leastways if it concerns Hudsuckuh.
Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
Adenoids?
A sawbuck!
But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't have invented it -- look at the man -- he's an imbecile!
The couch, please.
Oh, no, really, I --
Don't bother to thank me, it's the easiest thing in the world. Matter of fact, I know where a vacancy just came up.
Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or...
I understand that you're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts. I'm not that skilled as president. Oh sure, I put up a big front --  -- not that everyone's buying it.
You don't say.
I don't know...
It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Say, buddy! When is the sidewalk fully dressed? When it's 'wearing' Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha!
But, buddy, you were --
And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out!
Get up!
Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Say, that was a swell idea!
But, Buzz, you know I never --
Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph.
Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --
I haven't had --
You have a charming wife, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid.
Oh my God, sir!
But, sir!
Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.
Maybe he's wise.
She's damn good, Lou.
Looks like an awful lot of breakfast -- I don't know whether I'll be able to get away with it.
At the Houmfort.
If you say, miss.  And the enormous boat brought the long-ago Fathers and the long-ago Mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor.
I'm afraid so.
Mrs. Rand was at the Houmfort that night.  But there's nothing wrong with that.  She's gone there for years -- trying to take care of those people,  to help them.
Yes.
Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.
It'll wait.
By a curious coincidence, it's my day off, too.
Wait. I want to listen.
That doesn't sound like him.
Not to a nurse.  Sleep is a cure.
Mrs. Holland must have been beautiful ---
I've never given it much thought.
Don't.  It will save you a great deal of trouble and other people a great  unhappiness.
Didn't I?  I don't know.  That's the simple truth of it.  I don't know.
She is alive, Mr. Holland -- that's all.
I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort.  I thought they might cure her.
No.  It's not just how I felt toward Jessica.  I've been cruel to even you.
The night you came to me in this room -- to comfort me, to help me -- I turned you away.
This is something else.  They're curious.  Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
I'm quite sure nothing will happen, Doctor.
But I had no thought of harming her.  It wasn't I...
Insulin shock treatment is an extreme measure, Mr. Holland. But -- as Miss Connell pointed out when she suggested it -- this is an extreme case.
Why?
Don't see how. I think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff. No, trust me -- disaster pics. And air hockey.
And as usual no one believed me...
Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that "I'm OK. You're OK" stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and --
Elena.
What do you mean?
Elena, what are you're talking about?
Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
Benjamin. That's supposed to explain it?
In the car.
I'm not.
Paul? Yeah. You think --
Classes?
Stay out of trouble.
Yeah, but, I -- I've been working a lot lately, and -- No, that's not it. I guess we've just been on the verge of saying something, whatever it is, just saying something to each other. On the verge.
Damn right, but where the hell were you?
Don't bullshit me around, Janey. Jesus Christ, I waited around for more than half an hour, in nothing but my boxer shorts, and -- and what's all that about? What the hell happened?
Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband --
Nothing.
C'mon.
Let me.
Maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, I need to tidy up -- just a minute, I'll be right back. You'll wait?
Sure. Maybe coffee.
With Mikey?
I used to know how to cook.
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
You don't have to apologize. I'm too much of a cynic. You actually seem to be trying to figure things out -- don't mind me.
Moisture! Moisture!
Pharmaceutical! You are a god.
Yeah, Paul, are you gonna get home okay?
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot.
Hey, it's a sellable skill.
Yeah?
There's a TV in the basement.
Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
Watching what?
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
Yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth.
I have plans.
All my model planes.
The ones you built?
No.
Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it.
About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
Do it again.
Good.  He's up next.
I don't remember.
That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
You know my plan of action.
But he's zeroing in on <i>me</i>.  On <i>us</i>. Everyone's talking about it.
You don't have to be involved, Will.
Me and Hap.  A year and a half ago.  I knew the second I met Dobbs that he was guilty.  Smug, cold.  Dead eyes.  We had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it.  Nothing concrete.  Went over every inch of that apartment.
There've been other cases.  Where we've changed results.  Pushed witnesses. Manipulated evidence.  But Dobbs.  I wanted Dobbs more than anything.
Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?
What was?
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That <i>he</i> was going to take her!
Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.
I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have.
Told you I could write an ending.
Drop the gun, Walter.
We had feared we were the only ones...
But why?
Did you kill this vampire who made you both? Is that why you won't say his name? Santiago thinks you did.
Yes I knew him. Knew him well enough not to mourn his passing.
I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
And yet you knew what I would o.
And if I cut my hair again?
But it wasn't always so! I had a mother once! And Louis - he had a wife! He was mortal the same as she! And so was I!
Not you my dear.
I'll put you in your coffin. Forever.
Hush, Claudia don't talk about such things. Show me your book.
And he found me with you. I ran, sickened at what I'd done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. And have been every night hereafter.
I took your life. He gave you another one.
He'll never let us go.
Don't mock me, Louis. Help me.
And suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! And we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge.
No. She's frightened. She doesn't know where she is.
Be still!
I can feel it from them! They want to know who made us, what became of him. They have their rules, their idiotic rules!
It's only mortal death.
I can't do it.
You've just done it -
The crucifix -
Anything is possible. But just try it for a week. Come into New Orleans and let me show you some real sport!
What do you imagine you are Louis?
I don't pretend to know.
You finish her - if you feel so much -
Ah, but we have even more in common with our creator. come, I am like a mother tonight. I want a child.
Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our little daughter?
That's all past, Lestat.
And they frighten you?
Yes. I remember...
Saw you in the street outside. You seemed interesting. Is this where you live?
The same way you do it. A series of simple gestures. Only I moved too fast for you to see. I'm flesh and blood, you see. But not human. I haven't been human for two hundred years.
What about coffins?
What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
That's why you'll come with Titus, mon.
Karla! You promised.
Not me...no way...
Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?
It's too late for that.
That's right. It's how the species survives. You'll never convince me otherwise.  Wanna dance?
It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
I'm okay.
Are you sure?
Deep breaths --
It beets being on the mainland.
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
I'll talk real slow.
Hello?
I'd hate for you to have to blow...your whistle.
Hey --
Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
Not anymore.
Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.
I'll go find him.
Or even spirit messages from the next world.
This was once a cemetery.
All the graves?
I'm afraid so. There were rumors ——people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions.
We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
That was my companion. She sings little peasant songs quite nicely -- a completely untrained voice, of course.
How kind you are. It is so comforting to know that someone cares.
What an odd question!
My last name is Pherides.
That your father and I ——
Really, this is idiotic!
No, I want more than that. I beg you General, make sure --drive a knife through my heart -- anything.
Theodosia.
This girl -- Thea —- is not a servant in my household, sir. She is my daughter's companion. Now, sir, if you'll excuse me, I'll go have a look at Mr. Jacks.
It is not necessary to understand. We are leaving and I am thankful.
You are my friend.
She was born before your wife returned here to die. You never knew.
Well, all right . . .
The groom, idiot. Come on, get that ladder.
Merry Christmas.
Well . . .  . . . now, come right in here, Mr. Carter.
What are you, a mind reader or something?
I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.
Well, maybe I left the car up at Martini's. Well, come on, Gabriel.
I jumped in the river to save you so I could get my wings.
Oh, well, I can't . . .
Splendid! Is he sick?
All right.
Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
Mother? What do you want?
When'd you see him last?
Today, over at the house.
All right, all right. Here, give Daddy the flower. I'll give it a drink.
Will you try to get some sleep?
I know –– I know, but you just go to sleep, and then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden.
Fine.
Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
The last time he come in here. You hear that, Nick?
Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?
Kind that will help you find the answers, George.
Sure –– Sam Wainwright.
Yes, sir.
Yes –– charge.
Aw, get going!
Don't hurt my ear again!
No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he?
Okay.  What's yours?
Well, no younger than I was.
No, I'll settle for half that in cash.
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
Come on, George, let's hurry.
Some other time, George.
The whole town's gone crazy.
Yeah . . .  . . . you can take this one off now.
Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
They're not my children.
You like it? I'll send you a box.
I'd like to do that.
All right, sir.
I see. I've suddenly become quite important. What kind of security would I have, George? Have you got any stocks?
I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
I wouldn't live in it as a ghost. Now watch . . . right on the second floor there.
Would you rather leave?
My baby.
Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!
Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?
There's a shark....
Let's just go sailing, okay?
Want to talk about it?
Over here!
Rich people.  Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.
Could you just keep that crowd back, please?
You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess.
Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay?
About an hour, maybe two.  Let's see -- I came on about eight....
Please.  It's my job.
No place special.  Just hanging out.
Sean's still out there.
Did you get any pictures?
Y'know, Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town.
Sorry, I'm all booked up...  Come, m'dear.
Late.
Because they're playing our song.
Fooling around?
MMMmmmorning....
Door's locked.
In the den.
It's an island.  Got to run.
Because of today?  The beach?
No sweat.  A blessing in disguise. Back to the city, you can go to Bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat...we're surrounded by water here, you realize that?  Me, surrounded by water...Ridiculous.
Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone.
And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches!  In New England? We all lost on that one.
Two of them are still missing!
Go ahead, whatever it's worth.
What for?
Affirmative, affirmative.  Turn the Kids day-sailing back to port.  I heard you.  Patrol out.
Brody?  This is Patrol Base.
Did you say Cable Junction?
No.  Find your brother, okay?
Dad!  Dad!
I'm okay, baby, I'm here.  It's okay....
Sure they did....
Oh, yeah.  So why aren't they doing it now?
Sure.  They like to play.  We may see some today.
Ready?
Help!  Help!
Who'd you ask?
None at all.  I wonder what the Brebner twins are doing tomorrow night.
Just like this.
All of them.  Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all that whole gang.
Is there something I don't know about?
Maybe you and Brooke could come over to the town beach....
No way.  Everybody's going sailing. If you don't want to take me, just say so.
We're fighting wind and current. I though we'd be out longer, catch the incoming tide.
So it can't be done like that.  The man's a menace, plain and simple.
Go on, you're tired.
It would make a marvelous attraction;  the only Great White in captivity.
We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.
No.
Well, don't worry about your fiancee.  We'll watch over her.
Want another one?
Don't forget you have your brother.
Yeah.
See you later.
Baby goddamn scared me to death!
They just wanted to say hello.
Oh, yeah.  Very.
You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?
That we swim.
Michael, the sub's dead.
Get your reserve bottle and let's go.
Yes.
Bracelets.
Okay.
I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.
You wanted to know about a cave?
Michael, you're not going down there.
You don't have to prove anything.
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
It's one of the world's greatest creatures.
Because I don't trust you, that's why.
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
I like it when they wake up.
The grenade's just to intimidate Whitey.  He knows I have it, so he watches out.  Same is true when I film lions, tigers, rhinos...
Sure.
'Preciate it.
Hope with none of my girl friends.
Sure.  No problem.
How come?
And alone.
The one that goes underwater?
Yes, it's great!
Come on, it's fun!
Not for me.  I don't go in the water, remember?
Now what's this do?
It's okay, Sean.
Precisely.
Buzz off.
Thanks.  Bullshot.
Oh...
That's impossible.  If it's that big, why hasn't anybody seen it? Huh?  Tell me that.  It's like not seeing the Goodyear blimp in a swimming pool.
All right, hit those lights too.
Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity?
Was Uncle Sean ever bad?  Did you ever spank him?
Yes, I did.
It sure is....
I'll be right there.
We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
Hello?  Thea who?  I know it's Thea Brody.  How many grandchildren do I have?  I know you can use the phone by yourself. You're a big girl.  I know you're five.
Where's the lady who brings the soda?
It's not nice to be evasive.
The water's coming in...The water's coming in....
I didn't.
Mother....
What?
I won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water....  Never again...Never....
You were a monkey....
I'm fine....
We haven't had a real talk, have we? We'll do that before I go.
Mom, please don't start that again....
Good.
Trying to write our report....
You look tired....
Why'd you take the boat?
I'm going to finish what Jake and I started.  I owe him that.  Hell, I owe him everything....  I'll get something important done for both of us....
It was no accident....
I don't know how....
You're doing fine.  I'll keep you out of trouble.  Relax....
They took me to the chief, who took a long look at me, then took me in his hut....
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....
I have coffee in the thermos.
I'm too young for coffee.  Can I drive the plane?
Still chasing fish?
We'll be done pretty soon....
Inch by inch....
She's a tough lady....
It was like having snow in the house ...Jesus, I miss them.
If we had some decent money, I'd be able to read their temperatures... Study their motor systems....
The readings suck....
You leave me high and dry...You come back looking like a zombie....
Shouldn't pick on that.  Sorry.  I'm sorry about your brother....
Gave them the day off....
We don't write up anything until we're done....
Okay.. .we're done, man....
We got it together, Jake....
Okay...we got it together....
Shit....
What the hell does Hoagie have to do with this?
Maybe the gear crapped out....
You fall off a horse, you get right back on or you don't ride again....
I didn't ask you to....
I'm going down, Jake....
Maybe he only likes white meat....
Funny, Jake...Funny.
Don't be so down, man.  Money's gone...Shark's gone...We're back to conch...We've got it made....
You don't like my voice...?
My equipment doesn't crap out....
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
I'm not going to marry you until you straighten out your life and your hair.
I'd have to manage a nookie parlor to do that....
We're out of decaf...We're out of petty cash...And we're out of requisition forms....
Yes.
Yeah?
No, my mother's .. You better stop in .. I'm just here to feed the cat.
Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?
What do you mean, Ross?
Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime.
I haven't got it.
Why?
I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
You want me to stop the car?
How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over "Jennifer" for months?
Listen to me saying what?
You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?
What about Citrine?
What d'you mean, "bits."
That, I couldn't tell you .. And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone ..
I don't see that at all ..
Have you got a print from the hand?
You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.
Cut your own throat, you're ner- vous about it, tend to hesitate. He's got three trial cuts, lower left side of the neck, before he works up courage for the big one.
My pleasure .. Who's Popeye?
What are you looking for?
<u>If</u>, your friend from San Diego was up here, and thought for <u>one</u> out of <u>two fucken seconds</u>, she was a danger to him, he'da taken her out weeks ago ..
Well, I think I told you on the phone .. I went up to her room to say good-bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things ..
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
My hands?
What color was it?
I'm sorry. I'll get my things.
No problem. I'm not in a hurry.
Oh.
Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with.
I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..
Pray?
Then why didn't he kill me?
I'm here, honey. I'm right here.
No, c'mon, Freddy, let's have this out & over. You know what everyone thinks? They think you're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass. And no one's blaming you for it, I hear she's worth the flowers. But don't come in here get- ting holy over us. Sure I put it in the paper. Coz I wanted to <u>stop</u> this bullshit. I don't want you drunk out- ta your head searching my office ag- ain. it's pissing <u>me</u>, & <u>everyone</u> off.
Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.
Okay, this is working.
Oh honey.  It's spun.
I think you added the "brutal."
Yeah, Dotty. You did. _ 50.
Still going.
Talking and saying nothing, man, it's an art I have not mastered.
This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming.
No, I'm just... anxiously looking past it.  I already had my bachelor party.  It was called "my twenties." See you later.
Same to you.
Thanks.
Good evening.
We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere.
I'm relieved you said that.
Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?
Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --
No no no.  I just underestimated her...  her temper, I guess.  Why are we even talking about this?
Will you marry me?
Why do you love me?
Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick.
If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him.
Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it?  Say it with me.
Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom.
I gotta get back to Cushman.
I'm not about love -- I'm about "showing you the money."
Call me tomorrow.
Don't you even see -- I'm finished. I'm fucked. Twenty-four hours ago, I was hot. Now... I'm a cautionary tale!
You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude.  And I dig that about you.
It's a risk.
Tell me, because it's been a month, and she's about to take another job in San Diego.
You don't want to go home, do you?
You're jabbing at me. _ 112.
I think so.
Go.  Flee.
Where'd you find the perfect white shirt?
Jerry Maguire.  SMI.
Tell me, and then you can sleep.
Not a chance.
I've got the clients.  I've got the juice.
Hi Ray.
Okay.  I've been hogging it. You're right.  _ 76.
Funny...   I better go to bed.
This is how you play God.
What is it?
What?
Eric...
We have to help him.
I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he...
You couldn't have made that jump.
You mean it?
How low?
Dr. Grant was.
Three weeks. I had to rent some equipment.
That does sound lucky.
The bones will be there when we get back. That's the nice thing about them. They never run away.  And besides, you got me into this. I don't intend to be alone with these people.
I don't remember that on InGen's list.
We should take it with us to signal any planes.
Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish.
Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
I dunno. I mean, it was kind of preachy. Chaos-this, chaos-that. And like, to me, the guy seemed kind of high on himself.
Exactly. The difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are. To be able to touch them. That's what Billy wanted to do.
No we're not.
You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
Sure you have. You wrote that book...
Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help.
That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas, you actually wear it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa?
Last time I plugged it in, I suppose. Why?
If the nest is upwind, so are we. When he comes back, he'll know we're here before we have a chance.  The truck --
Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. God save me from academics.
Not without a shot of the nest.
Well, is he?
I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
What?  Why?
Operations building.  Far end of the street.
Piss.
Oh, God.
Don't ask me.  The guy's completely out to lunch.
Our chance to do what?
No.
Why did you come here?
John Hammond.
You think this is all a joke?
We'll kill it with too much, we'll put it into respiratory arrest!  I'm almost done.  Damn it, I need another adhesive, something pliable I can --
Where's Ian?
Damn!
The door security systems are shutting down.
What now?
- - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understand correctly, all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct?
Wait a minute.  What exactly does this mean?
No trick to it.  Just stop running the program.  Leaving them unattended.
Anybody at all.  Feel free to speak up.
Six weeks?
Come along.  I know my way around a kitchen.  Come along.
Oh my God.
Small versions of adults, honey.
- - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
- - barfs them up - -
No?  Non-linear equations?  Strange attractions?  Dr. Sattler, I refuse to believe that you are not familiar with the concept of attraction!
Dinosaur eats man.  Woman inherits the Earth.
Microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome.  That's what?
I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
Yeah.
No, we don't have any animatronics here.  These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.
Whichever one you are.
Really?
I'm stuck.  The seat's got my feet!
Tim, you're going to have to let go of the fence.  Tim! Get down right now.  Get off the fence!  Now!
Me?  Oh, hell yes.  Three.  I love 'em.  I love kids.  Anything at all can and does happen.
Yeah, they hate me.
Kids get scared.
There's gotta be something - -
The brachiosaur?  Thirty.
After careful consideration, Dr. Grant - - so have I.
All night.
Okay.  Keep low.  Follow me.
Don't you see the danger, John, inherent in what you're doing here?  Genetic power is the most awesome force ever seen on this planet.  But you wield it like a kid who's found his dad's gun.
Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.  Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them.  Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!
There's no sign of him anywhere.
Sure.
Thanks for the presents.
We love the presents.
Yeah, you weren't in that last one.
Fifty? We need seventy-five.
Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...
Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
Yeah?
That's my job.
What?
His camera... it's still recording.
Compared to this guy... amateur.
He's fucking nuts.
Doesnit sleep?
Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.
He's my client, and this is important. Enjoy your waitresses.
Now.... according to the file, Krueger was burned to death in a fire in 1968. But get this -- beginning in 1984, there was _another_ series of murders in Springwood. All teenagers... all killed in their sleep... all killed with finger blades just like Krueger's.
That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
Uh-huh...
It was Krueger, wasn't it?
I don't know... but I think he's pissed.
Krueger's the greater danger right now. We have to stop him.  _Springwood_. That's where he'll go. That's where he's always gone.	But Springwood's not like Crystal Lake. There's a couple hundred thousand people there. He could be anywhere.
Think it'll do any good?
And if he's not?
Yes -- we do.
There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
What an extraordinary request!
Then its authority is in doubt.
No, I left it in his office.
He has it, he just hasn't noticed it yet, all right?
Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?
No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
That he was -- satisfied in that regard.  I didn't want to pry.
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
When I have no reason to doubt.
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.
Over?  It's only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit.
Should I tell you why I joined our late lamented nihilists? Why I became a murderer? Because murder ... is bliss.  It's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate Evil -- once you've adopted its procedure.
I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
... Just a perception.
I'll bear that in mind.
That the police may have allegiance to something other than truth.
You mean because it's been a while since there was a sunny day?  What a good detective you are.
What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?
It's ok.I know what you were feeling.
This shit is bad luck! Don't you understand? You treat it like a game - two men have already died!
Take to look out there ..- Have you seen what he's done? You're talking about a crazy animal!
It' s alright Jack ... it' s alright.
Y'know ... traditional ceremonies where the woman ... divest themselves of their undergarments.
An ape ... some kind of ape.
Yes?
Guess!
Look -- could I use your phone?
A few more days. We know who did this.
Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't --
From the beginning I don't know why the hell he's messin with you. If he was me he'd know better. If he was even a city boy he'd know better. You're a whore Miss Daniel, that's the truth of it, right? Now somethin I'd like you to look at.
Yes.
Then it doesn't matter what I do any more, does it?
Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?
Oh no, I don't think --
Dew yew hayuv ah-dentifikyshun?
I go on rounds.
Rounds, what are they? -- don't watch me, keep talking.
No.
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
So you're not too different from him, or the chap on the roof, or Tommy-baby --
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
No.
You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out!
Mm.
Yeah.
Well, I told him I wouldn't - uh - go there any more.  I know it's tough to understand, but it wasn't easy. You see, he was nice to me. I mean, it wasn't just him. I got something out of it too I guess. Anyway, I told him I wouldn't go there anymore.
You're going back?
I believed her, Pete.
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture.
Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time.
No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.
It's in the report.
Not unusual.
About his letters -- that's all she remembered. Quite violent material, I'd say, obsessive, a quite sick man. But that's not unusual either.
You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
Examine this letter please.  We recovered that from the shredder -- the plant disposal and incinerator system. Grunemann apparently typed it Friday, before he left, decided not to send it, tossed it away. We've already contacted the New York Police; they think they know the girl in question.
Thought it might. It's off an arrest report you typed two years ago. Man you wanted samples of everybody.
Yes?
Not particularly.
In real life when does he hit you?
Ladies and gentlemen...
Soon.  Very soon.
That's right.  You're absolutely right...It's been a long time since I made French toast.
Mom, I mean dad?
C'mon, Billy.  I'm trying to work for God's sake...
I'm allergic to onions.
No.
Uh, huh?
Was there Burger King?
I'll send your toys there and I'm sure you'll get some new ones.
Will you come and say good-night to me every night?
Your honor, I would like to place in evidence a report on Mrs. Kramer's therapy by her therapist, Dr. Elinore Freedman of La Jolla, California.
Your honor, I would request a direct answer to a direct question.  Does she have a lover?
Eight, almost nine years.
Did he ever fail to provide for you?
Yes.
Ted, I'm leaving you.
That represents a gross billing in excess of two million--  What?!
Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry.
Here are the slips for the laundry and the cleaning.  They'll be ready on Saturday.
Fine.
Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember?
Ted, all my life I'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty-two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child.  I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get.  Only... I guess it wasn't far enough. So I started going to a shrink.  Ted, I've had time to think. I've been through some changes. I've learned a lot about myself.
Please, Ted.  I never would have brought it up if I thought--
Oh, God...Oh, my God...
I don't know, Jim.  This whole thing has happened so...Pow-- like that.
I don't know, Jim...
Jim, this is garbage.  This isn't anything like what we talked to Revlon about.  None of it. You can't--
He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.
You dope.  O'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy.  All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home.
I don't want to hear another word against him.  Not another word.  He's a wonderful man ...a wonderful man...
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
Fine.
I lost him?  I lost him?
It's going to cost.
Don't worry.  I'll get the money.
I mean...things.  Ted, Joanna's very unhappy and--
Slow down...Slow down...
Ha!  You tell me.
A moment.
Khambas are wild men.
I have a copy for you.
Did you receive the letter?
I pooped.
Is that big?
No. Not very big.
No. This war is almost over.
Will we ever be in war?
He warned about the future of Tibet.
When it is time.
Look here!
What is the danger from the Chinese, now?
Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.
Britain chooses not to.
I had relinquished doubt.
I will alert the Chinese delegation. You know, I would never have let you go alone, Kundun.
We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
It is too early to implement all the clauses of the Seventeen Point Agreement. We will establish a Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region of Tibet. The pace of reform must meet with the desires of the Tibetan people. Changes must be made slowly, as you, yourself, judge necessary.
Yes, I am aware. How has your time in China been?
He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams.
What do you think?
You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
These are dangerous times. They want the Dalai Lama to lead them.
We have had fun, you and I. Fun for a little boy in an old palace.
We have.
Like my mother.
And law enforcement, such dangerous work.  The idea that you could die suddenly with no offspring, disconcerting, let's mate, commit your genes to perpetuity.
Why are we landing?
No!!  Out!
And you like me.
He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.
You probably <u>do</u> want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker.
Get your big gun and guard the shore.  Hector.  Go to your tent.
I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to--
'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.
What's going on?
Scales were oval.  It was an <u>Asian</u> crocodile.
Nothing's real.
Excuse me?
Oh, bullshit.
How would <u>you</u> know, what--
I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of--
Good.
Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
Um... y'know...  Yeah.
Just forget it.
Let's get away from the shore.
Ssssh!
What?
You're mushing it a little around the--
Calm down.
Well...
He's floating.  Take it home.
He heeds a tourniquet.
You wanna ride in my truck?
Likewise.
Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
We shouldn't even really be doing this.
Where is he?!
I'll take it!
Yes.
Yes.
Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.
It looks like a branch.
<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
What is this?
<u>That</u> was a bust.
Look ten feet into the water.
Absolutely.
You work for me.  I'm not comfortable with-- y'know, "us"...
The somebody else part?
Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--
I <u>tapped</u> you.
<u>You</u>?
Shitbutt?
The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him...  Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages...
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU
How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
Good. Then you should be able to remember the rules.
He's my patient! I have rights!  I'm not just some turnkey, Miss Starling. I shouldn't even be here this afternoon. I had a ticket to Holiday on Ice.
Yes sir. I can find it by myself.
Not yet! - just wait for me.  Maybe in about two seconds.
Yes sir.
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
Miggs has been murdered.
Murdered...? How?
What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.
What would it take?
State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?
I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are...  You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.  Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me.
Or just as worthless. But I want you in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when he gets tired of toying with Senator Martin, he'll talk to you again. There's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip.
Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours.
You do until six p.m.
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
I am, yes.
May I see your credentials?
We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
No. But I will make you happy... I'll give you a chance for what you love most, Clarice Starling.
Advancement, of course.  Go to Split City. See Miss Mofet, an old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T... Now go. Go.  I don't think Miggs could manage again so soon, even if he is crazy - do you?
No. Tell me why.
A cattle ranch?
How long did you live there?
Why so briefly?
No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.
I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is.
No! That's incidental.
No. We just -
No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice. You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch?
Then something woke you. What? Did you dream...? What was it?
It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.
Would you, Doctor? That would be so kind.
Did you breast-feed her?
Officer Starling. Welcome back.
I'm the one who found his perforating proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, right now?  Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I?
Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora doesn't marry you, I shall.
In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...
I do not remember them. I was one or two.
And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
Sorry to disappoint you...
Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
No. I will find you.
There was none!
What?
He knew the consequences. And he stayed.  Are those the actions of a criminal?  ...Duncan, do something.
Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?
I am sorry, Duncan...
Fort Edward, then?
I thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia?
Then we take the south rim down the mountain and it's 12 miles cross country to Fort Edward.
I said... France is your enemy. Not ours.
You're not coming with us?
Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers foolish with brandy and steal his lands to sell them for gold to the white man?  Would the Huron have greed for more land than a man can use? Like Francais Black Robes do?  Would Huron kill tribes with disease? Would the Huron fool Seneca into taking all the animals in the forest for beads & brandy? But sell the fur to the white man for gold?...  Those are the ways of Yengeese and Les Francais masters. Are they the ways of Huron men who hunt & work the land? Or of dogs?  ...Magua's heart is twisted. He would make himself into what twisted him. A Dog, become Master of Dogs. But are Hurons dogs?  ...Magua's way is false. It is like the white sickness. Magua's way will bring only sadness and shame. Is there another way? I don't know.  I am Nathaniel of the Yengeese; Hawkeye, adopted son of Chingachgook, of the Mohican people... Let the children of the dead Munro go free... I speak the truth.
It was a war party. It means they're on the attack up and down the frontier.
I thought British policy is 'Make the World... England', sir.
Sir!  Upon the center, wheel to the left- about!  March!  Rear ranks, proper distance!  Front ranks, take your distance! March!  Halt!  Make ready! 
Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?
For Munro children?
Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat his heart. Before he dies Magua will put his children under the knife so the Grey Hair will see his seed is wiped out forever.
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
And this?
Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...
Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
My colors?
Allow me to consult with my officers.
Granted, Monsieur.
France.
These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know.
Why Sixpack?
Intelligence may not be the right word...
No!
That's an order!
Williams...get DeJesus' suit on the "sick rack" and do a diagnostics.  Any other suit problems she should know about?
How do you know it was Williams?
Seeing how my stock's doing...
Where's Jones?
All right...
No sir...I just wanted to know if you needed a hand?
Ahhhh!
Well, suit yourself, then...its your decision...  Ha ha...a little joke...suit yourself...
I'm not anxious to find out, either.
Do it.
And hit the surface in the middle of a typhoon?...No, thank you. I'll take my chance down here.
What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
Under there?
Well, why haven't they answered our flares?
Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
I'm not touching you!
He's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he doesn't know it. ' * Cut from completed film.
The Baptist got his name from drowning people for Hatchet.
They can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can they?
Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .
Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em.
No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?
About twenty minutes.
All right, Dad.
Sure is.
All right, Kenny.
Jesus, I have heard about him.
We're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold; we gotta find 'em.
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?
I must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked; they're not suspicious. Everybody who goes there are toffs. They're all into that karma crap: `If I don't harm nobody, nobody harms me' stuff.
Who are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there.
All right, all fucking right, I am coming.  Willie, he doesn't know you are here, just sort something out, OK.
Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .
Why not? The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea.
There is nowhere else to keep it, and it's the last place they are going to look. Anyway the battle's over and the war is won.
I'11 meet you in the car.
It's pay day, ain't it?
I wanted to talk to you about that.
Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?
I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?
It's the mother of fuck-ups, stupid!
Nick the Greek.
Tom, the fatter you get, the sadder you get.
What do you mean?
I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.
The--the officers.
If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated.
Everybody on the border knows that story.
Colt Peacemaker.
There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
I'm not picking it up.
Yeah, well--
Best part of the job.
Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead.
It wasn't just you, Bunny.
What?
When you're his age you'll still be pissed off about him.
So I'm part-Indian?
You ever know a fella named Eladio Cruz?
It's a lead mine.
Cliff--
He can't hear with that rig on-- Mikey!
I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.
Yeah?
What's it doing on a rifle range?
We been through this before--
You get much of that in here?
This is an official visit, then--
I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
Eladio Cruz.
Mercedes Gonzales Ruiz.
Quien es? [Who is it?]
We was by the river? And I hear my friend callin' for help, and I look and she has falling in the water--
They need help. Jaime, Anselma-- esta es mi jefa--
Don't worry about it. He owes me some favors.
Buddy Deeds. He had a way.
He was a unique individual.
Right. But nobody here ever noticed him till they read his name on the national news--
Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing hooky--
You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
He still living?
Charley Wade.
Do you?
The Sheriff.
You ever play one of these?
Well, don't ever start up on 'em, cause once you do you can't stop. I tell myself I'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here I sit with half the day gone.
He had the club out on the old trail road--
Do you remember the last time you saw him?
Okay? He's not here?
I'd like to see them spend a day pulling 14-year-olds off of each other--I should get combat pay--
I have new respect for some of my kids, meeting the parents they've been dealt--
What do you think?
I got a bad stomach. It helps me digest.
Murdered him?
Chucho Montoya saw it with his own eyes. Shot him in cold blood.
We haven't talked since high school.
They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
Most people did, yeah.
Nice-looking kid.
Yeah.
Yeah.
More, I hope.
You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
I remember thinking you were the one part of my life Buddy didn't have a piece of--
Yeah.
I'm going over to the other side.
The Republicans?
Oh.
No, Sheriff, I'm just--
And people better clear out of here! Now!
You sell much out here?
So when did Buddy leave?
So? What's he gonna do, arrest us?
Yeah.  It's French.
I've heard a name.  Someone they talk about in whispers.
Nix?
How?
Nope.
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
That's so cool.
Deep shit?
All right.  It was...
He's a priest?
No.  He's just a guy who's got a nose for this shit.  Like you.
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
Harry.
I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
What about Jennifer Desiderio?
He was the real thing, right?
What then?
No it isn't.  You can't help me.
I'm here, Harry.
Yes.
Somebody killed him.
Oh God.
What makes you so sure?
I got a file on him two inches thick.  He's a petty fraudster. This is something else.  Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?
Another fucking magician. Jesus.
I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...
I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
What about Swann's miracles?
If he was so good why's he so dead?
It's one in the afternoon.
I'm here to offer you a job.
I saw him in Vegas once.
A ticket home,
Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
No.
Was that Swann's idea?
What about?
What?
Yeah.  You could say that.
Harry D'Amour.
People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know?
Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her.
Didn't know you read minds.
I saw it with my own fucking eyes! See, that's his best trick.  No illusions.  Just the truth.  Are you ready for that?
I don't know.
What?
Maybe... I... don't...
I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me. He'll find me.
Is he the Puritan?
Fuck you.
I should have been honest with you, right from the start.  I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  I was born to murder the world.
Not true.
No!
Bob, it's me.
Oh, hi, Elaine.
Yeah, I'll stay.
Try twenty-five.
You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?
Yeah? But look at you.
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
They really have to work on that street name thing.
Oh, she'll love it.
I don't want to be.
A coke.
I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?
Yes, no.
Ok, bye.
Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
It's four in the morning... I'm going to go to sleep.
I don't know.
Is there anything I can do?
It's ok.
Good...I'm tired.
I went to a temple today and I didn't feel anything.
That's ok, you'll figure it out.
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
I gotta go... and I don't really like champagne.
What happened?
I don't know.  In a way, I'm glad it all happened.
I don't know.  What are they?
And how would you describe him?
Just me.
It's nothing.
You have to tell me who did it.
This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.
What did you hear?
It was perfect.  The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away.
Um hm.  That's right, Maya.
Miette, come here and relax.
Well I know he's come here before.
I didn't know what else to do...
Peter Kelson?
I cranked it all the way up.  Nothing but hum.
What?!?!
You're already contaminated.  It's why you couldn't hear the tape.  There's probably a pentacle near your bed.  To sanctify you.
My parents are dead.  Don't even think of bringing them into this.
The books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out.
I'm going to look around.
I see things.  My worst fears.  You need to know something, Peter.  I was possessed once.  Like Birdson.  It took Father Lareaux six days to pull me out of it.
We're going to do this.
You have to say that.
I was desperate.  I knew you wrote about murders.  I needed a way in.
Until it happens, you're still a human being.
What are these?
I know who he is.
A lot of good that'll do.
There weren't any voices.
Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...
Yeah, right.  I don't know why I bothered inviting you guys.  I knew you wouldn't show.
So you can see where you're going when you crawl up his asshole.
Had to let her go.  I see you thinkin' there, superstar. Don't.
His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex with him?  I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.
No I don't.
What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
When I said Quincy could do better, I was thinking about you.
Camille, she'll be fine.
You sure?
The doctor said it was okay.  Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat.
You want the job or not?
It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.
Gotta wait til the press conference.
To do what you love.
I don't know sometimes.
No one's forcing her.
I found you someone.
No.
If you were tore up I would not be claiming you.  Trust.
Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?
She hates all freshmen.
But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni. Ten seconds left, you run out the clock.
How's that been?
I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my cheerleader.
I just can.
I never knew a girl that could play.
I don't care.
I'm warning you.  You don't stall that bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you.
You either.
So you took Shawnee, huh?
I said fine.
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
So you're gonna act salty all night?
Plan to.
Quincy...
Nah.  I have curfew.
I just said I didn't fuck around.  But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me.
What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?
You're what?
Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.
I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough.
Wow.
So why'd you give up ball?
What?
One game.  One-on-one.
And what happens when you lose?
I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
Let's hope I can say the same about you one day.
No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it.  It's not true.
I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I ain't that kid's father.
I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
Came by to check on you.
I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?
Oral surgery.  Corrective teeth surgery.
How are you paying tor the braces, Donnie?
I don't know.
THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSSINESS. I HAVE BEEN A GOOD WORKER, A GOOD AND LOYAL WORKER FOR YOU, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE.
Shut it.  Shut yer fuckin' mouth.
Brain and Lung.
Oh, she's fine.
Sure is.  So why call me?
It's me.  Claudia.  It's me.
Don't sit down.
...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia. Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you --
I don't want you to think that I'm that way to you -- I'm not gonna call you a slut or something --
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's not -- what's a 422?
Tempural-something-mandibular, thing with something, I dunno. But it affects my ear, I don't even know if I have TMJ exactly but just very tight, like - it's like a muscle spasm and it's just gets so clenched --
yeah, good, ok.
Good bye.
Yeah.
ok.
Yeah.
Can I tell you something?
-- no, like what, what do you mean?
What?
You mind if I come in, check things?
yeah, yes, hi, hello.
-- can I get you?
What?
Jesus Christ, Stanley, you can't go to the bathroom now.  You have exactly one minute before we're back on the air, this is NOT the time to go to the bathroom.
LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GET HIS MONEY AND GO -- DID YOU GET HIS MONEY? DID YOU GET IT?  DID YOU GET HIS MONEY, DAD?
I'm not mad, son, I will not be mad at you and it's ok and please put it down and I won't be mad and I won't --
Put me on the payroll, find out, find out wassup --
You don't just sign up to be a police officer -- it's about three years of training -- ok?
I'm trained, I'm ready to go, you wanna buy some candy to help underprivelaged youth in the --
No school today.  My teacher got sick.
Have you ever been to Juvenille Hall?
This sounds threatening.
That's right.
I'm sick.
I'm sick and I'm in love.
Brad, I know you don't love me now --
I paid you back.
I've been a good worker, Solomon. A hard and loyal --
Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
Yeah.
You got it.
Yep.
I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did.
I warned you -- I get on a roll...
So boring, so useless --
-- there's a lot more important things I'd like to put myself <u>into</u> --
I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
Do you remember a Miss Simms?
She's retired.
Not a problem.
From '84 to '89.
...this close...
...ok...
...just wait...Dad...you want something...can you say...
I got a call of a disturbance, you're door was open, I just wanna see what's goin' on --
I AM CALM.
Are you lyin' to me?
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
Yes I can, Marcie.  And until you start givin' me some straight answers: I'm gonna assume that some mischief has been goin' on here.
-- do not do this -- my gun is drawn and If I Have To Open That Closet you will get shot -- Step Out Now.
...you know...
You're making me feel so dirty and shitty. I feel like a big piece of shit right now.
I got in trouble at school.
Fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards?
You want her right now?
Slowly or quickly?
Did you tell her?
Love you too..
We just do it...we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, I guess...
No.  No.
It's over becuase...for all the the right reasons I hope, what I said.
I don't know....
I'm not mad.  I am, but I'm not.  Y'know?
But you can't say....
No.
Hello.  Is Claudia here?
Are you on drugs right now?
This is not any fucking medication talking, this isn't -- I don't know. I don't know -- Can you give me nothing? You have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking will -- I don't want any money, I couldn't live with myself, this thing I've done -- I've fucking done so many bad things -- I fucked around.  I fucked around on him, I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You're his lawyer, our laywer, THERE, I'm his wife, we are married. I broke the conract of marriage, I fucking cheated on him, many times over, I sucked other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - ....fuck.... Other Things I've Done..
This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.
Linda --
Hang up the phone.
....it's alright....
mmmhmm.
Yeah.
Ok. One of those.  And...um...Barely Legal?
That's it.
Should be one-thirty.
Sure.
See you.
Stand up.
Why did you do this?
Alright.
First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
You have prayed too much.  Your mind is weak.
Don't look so shocked, Phillippe. Come, you're going back to prison.
Tomorrow.
Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
You can do it.
Three days??!!
But -- what is Porthos doing?
About to hang himself, I should think.
You're a fool!
Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.
I trained those men myself.  They will stand and fight.  But if we are to die, let it be this way.
Forgiveness?
Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip.
Die?  What...?
Life is too long.  Except when we have our friends.  Look at you! You're still a boy!  Sit, sit!  I'll open a bottle of wine.
I came to see you safely out.  Check for yourself.
Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone!
Porthos told me.
D'Artagnan...
Your Majesty has had many women --
It is not Raoul's heart alone that concerns me.  It is yours.  I know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like Michelle.  But do they love you?  Do you love them?  What about a queen to love?  A son of your own?
There is more to love than he knew, or that you know.
He is my brother.
Aramis, Porthos and Athos too.  I know what they have done was a threat against you -- and yet that threat has been removed, with no harm coming to your Majesty.  If their passions were in error, their spirits have ever been noble. Forgive them.
Yes, yes, go on.
Athos, the former Musketeer, has just fought with several of your guard, at the Musketeers' Gate.
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
That food has spoiled.  That is why it was not shipped to the army.
... Nothing.
My dear, I've already done it.
No, you may wait behind the screen.
We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
Did you report it stolen?
It happened too fast.  He was in the back, quiet and calm and boom! He was out - and gone.  We...we fanned out...Stanton must have let his guard down!
Gotta come from somewhere...
Yeah, it was opened -  with a goddamn screwdriver!!!
Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.
And what did he do to the girl?
Who is it?
I don't know - but he's from the FBI.
Good! We'll get it to the nearest outlying station and hold it for prints - we're on our way -  You coming?
Up north.
Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?
No, but I'm listening.
No -
Neither did I.  I'll make it up to you, I promise...
Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
Yeah...
I have nowhere else to go, Tubbs, I need your help!
Shit, what I have now made our setup in Angola look like Tinker Toys.  I've been skipping through Internal Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to check it out?
What else is new?
Who knows?  Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that, but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa.
I'm not going anywhere!
I'm going to need a way to get there.
You must be going somewhere.
Screw him!
County jail - get in.
Because I'm professionally concerned about him. And he'd pick up on that. He's fast. He hates being prodded and poked.  So do I.  What do you want?
His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate?
He may have an unconscious homosexual conflict. A fear of being gay. He objects to the word 'fairy.' Plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead.  I believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in Mr. Leeds.
The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  I don't have an answer for you.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this.
And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.
You wouldn't like it, either if you had it.
What else did you keep out of the papers?
Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive.
No.
The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...
As long as they're dead...
I'LL come back later. I got messages at the Holiday Inn to collect.
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
What's one way?
You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.  The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop.
What is it?
Personal ads?
It's your call, Will. What do we do?
Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit.
There is none! We've run it through the computer a dozen times.
There's some film cans in the far corner of the room underneath one of the windows.
Yes, are you okay...?!
I'm fine.
I'm fine, Francis.
Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back.
I'm very scared.
Not me.
Are you a man?
Dr. Chilton.
It's written on toilet tissue.  'My dear Dr. Lecktor, I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me. I know that you alone can understand what I'm becoming.  'I know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming.  Just as the source of light is burning.  Mr. Graham, there's a hole torn and punched out, then it says...  'I have a complete collection of your press notices.  I think of them as unfair. As unfair as mine. The "Tooth Fairy." What could be more inappropriate.  Investigator Graham interests me.  Very purposeful looking. I hope we can correspond.  There's another piece missing here. I'll read the bottom part.  'After I hear back from you, I might send you something wet.  Signed: Avid Fan.  It has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom.
Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too
No. I can help you.
Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not.
What's average?
Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?
I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma?  I got a diploma and everything.
If I were?
Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you.
I want to see you, too.
What's the problem, Molly?
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
Tell her I called.
That's right.
Thanks.
Go on to the house.
Lt. Fisk said...
Oh, Jesus... Come in.  Honey...!
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
Yes.
And Hobbs died?
Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
Yes.
In the papers. I don't tear out the articles.  I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
Do you know how you caught me, Will?
Why does it feel good?
...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor?
I hope you have a second chance...
I told you, I'm not a comedian.  And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter.
And that's great.  But do it in LA and New York!  There you experiment! Show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage!  I don't care!
I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!
B-but I have them.
But that's it.  I needed you to believe!  Our family will be in the newspapers.  People will look, and they'll be touched.  Because your emotions were honest!
I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day.
Oh.  So you were just pretending to be an asshole.
Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?
It's probably just a strained muscle.
Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.
I'll take my chances!!
Look... I don't know what your problem is...
So your name's not Gorsky.
I used to think you were original.
Yeah.  They don't know whether to be sad, or angry.
Of course he's in his room.  All his "friends" are in there.
There!
It's my name.
It's already begun.
Know what?
And you are?
You all look the same to me.
I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.
I know.  It's her fault.
We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.
Have to.  The image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there's way too much information to decode the Matrix.  You get used to it, though.  Your brain does the translating.  I don't even see the code.  All I see is blonde, brunette, and redhead.  You want a drink?
Really?
Hello, Neo.  Do you know who this is?
What -- what lesson?
She would say she knows enough.
She told you exactly what you needed to hear.  That's all.  Sooner or later, Neo, you're going to realize just like I did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path.
He is the One.  He is the One!
I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you.
Shit, I'm sorry.
Honestly?  I don't know.
What do you mean, without him?
That was a long time ago.
Gee-zus.
Why?
That's different.
There has to be something that we can do.
Because...
No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else.
Where is it?
Every leader of every ship is given the codes to Zion's mainframe computer which can be accessed only through the Matrix.  They are used only in emergencies.  If an agent had those codes and got inside Zion's mainframe they could disable the entire defense system.  It would be the end of everything.
Mr. Wizard, get me the fuck out of here!
Duck!
You're not far from Cypher.
I'll be all right.
Know where he is?
Sounds good.
Nothing's private...
Hey!  You want good stuff, or you want shit?
All right!  Quiet!  For $40 I could give you...
Well, my stuff comes from Maryland... you know what that means?
Ok.  For another $5.00 a special on the packs.
I gotta get the stuff.
She don't look Jewish.
Kennedy.
It's an open ticket.  I can go anywhere up to $350.
You flew before?
Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me.  My mother can send me some.  I don't know.
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
All right, forget it.  Tony, you got anything we can put on his face?
Wouldn't bother me.
Yeah, big man...get yourself in more trouble.  You make a fool out of him, you're doing the same to me. I signed for you don't forget.
Ok, ok...take it easy.  I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.
Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.
How?
That'll help you out fine.  That's the best way for you, not for me! I swear to God, I'll rip you open if my uncle ever hears a word about this.  You understand?  I don't care what happens, he doesn't find out. 
Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing.  The only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?
Ok, how's everything going?
Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me.
Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that.  I don't need this aggravation.  I'm getting old.
Nope...
Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
I know that Charlie but look at my side.  You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him.  What happens if this kid don't pay me?  I gotta collect from you?  I don't want to do that.  I made a deal with him not you, right?
All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of.  I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing.
Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
Fine.
Stripper?
No...his business is bad.  But I'll decide what to do and you...and you just keep out of anything that might...might...er draw attention to you.
Ok.
Our friend, Groppi, went to his mother's house.  And when he was there...at night...
What did he do?
No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
"Francis Macomber."
It's all right.
What is it now?
It was nothing.  I'm almost finished.
No.  Of course he lives there. Would I point it out to you if he didn't?
Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...
Sal!... fourteen street.
You mean it's heisted.
Quiet please.
Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
Sure.
No.
I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.
A name?
From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America.  This is orange, from real Seville oranges.  Lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.
Remember everybody, tonight, dinner in the city at Daddy's.  You too, Drew.  We've still got some loose ends --
Honey --!
You know what I'm saying, Joe?
-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
And that?
Both.
I would say, sir, it is right up there with Jif and Skippy.  But miles ahead of Peter Pan.  Like a taste?
How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?
Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.
Yeah.  Goodnight.
Am I not obligated to?
I didn't say.
Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already.  Need any help with the details?
Thank you.
Of whom?
Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.
In my sleep.
Did you just hear something?
No no, not you.
Olympic.
Yes.
Glad I could be of some help.
But the matter's still on the table, Bill --
Please.  Don't worry about him.  And above all, don't antagonize him.
Bontecou wants a quick response and --
I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you.
Mandatory retirement upon our Chairman's sixty-fifth birthday.
No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to offer you a deal.
You're on, Quin-cee.  Destination Hospital.  Joe, you'll be the Tour Guide.  Okay?  How's that sound to you?
That we did.  Thanks to you.  He was wobbling, mind you, but you spplied the coup de grace.
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
He said that?
You wait here'n to take us?  Like you bus driver to dere?
Some spot you pick.
Make it go 'way.
Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.
Good morning, Jennifer.
Hey, this is fun.
Confused, huh?  About what?
'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.
Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.
What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish?  I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you.  Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place.  He was setting up Bill from day one.  Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr. Inside.  And I was the fool who made it all happen.  Oh God, what do I do?
I'm sorry.
Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon.
'To bed'?
How beautiful.
For how long?
No worse than it gets for me.  I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave.
We know all that we need to know --
Lightning struck.  We caught it in a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want to be with you, Joe --
I love you now, I'll love you always --
You think so?
Shook me up.  I mean that you knew her and everything --
Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left- field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?
Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything, Bill.  You'll ruin the good start we had last night.  I felt as if I were being treated like a person.  'Joe' this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile - Quince passed me the rolls -- no 'rapture' or 'passion' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting, but I am cer- tain, should you - uh - say - uh - who I am - our adventure would end abruptly.
A 'deal'?
You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.
I don't understand.
Yes, I am.  There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor.  Why don't you go down and read some magazines?
This part I'm interested in.
I guess...
I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.
Yeah.
I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan from the moment she was born, and I love her now, and every minute in between, and what I dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her, who is worthy of her, who is of this world, of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life.
It's not necessary, Joe.  Drew's going to step aside --
Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
He is --
An offense --
Then don't.
I'm here.
It requires competence, wisdom, experience -- all those things they say about you in testimonials -- and you're the one.
Show me around.  Be my guide.  And in return, you get...
Get what?
Watch it!
No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.
I hope so.
Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?
Well, I wasn't going to say that --
What were you going to say?
You're not listening --
Stay open.  Who knows?  Lightning could strike.
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
I don't understand.
Love.  Passion.  Obsession, all those things you told me to wait for.  Well, they've arrived.
I don't know, I can't say --
Yes, but --
Because I like you so much.  You have coffee here every morning, don't you?  If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
I've got to get back for the evening shift, so make yourself at home, watch T.V., whatever. Just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed. I never need them all anyway.
Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable.
I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.
You're still paying for it. It's still Your room.
Just two. So far.							  *
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
Thanks.
Interested in buying one?
Don't say anything else.
I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -
Must be tough living life according to a few scraps of paper. Mix up your laundry list and your grocery list, you'll be eating your underwear.
* So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  * 							   * The world doesn't disappear when you			   * close your eyes, does it? My actions			   * still have meaning, even if I can't			    * remember them. My wife deserves				   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether I know about it.			    *
I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
Yes.
Such as?
I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.
What's this all about?
What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.
About your whore of a wife?
Dying.
I remember my wife dying.
Oh. But haven't we met before?
So why did you come here?
I'm not interested in the company position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.
We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal.
Thank you.
I guess I've told you about my condition.
You're in a playful mood.
You know it?
Lenny, it's Teddy. Look, stay there, okay? I'm gonna be right over.
So I see. It's good to see you. My name's Teddy.
I don't know.
Prove it.
She couldn't.
Why are you following me?
He knows you're no good on the phone, so		    * he calls you up to bullshit you.				  * Sometimes you stop taking his calls, so			* he slips something under your door to			  * frighten you into answering your phone			 * again. He's been pretending to help you.		    * Feeding you a line of crap about John G.		    * being some local drug dealer.					*
You tell everyone about Sammy. Everyone who'll listen. "Remember Sammy Jankis, remember Sammy Jankis". Great story. Gets better every time you tell it. So you lie to yourself to be happy. Nothing wrong with that - we all do. Who cares if there's a few little things you'd rather not remember?
Sammy was a con man. A faker.
I never said he was faking! I never said that!
Your name's Teddy.
My mother calls me Teddy. I'm John Edward Gammell. Cheer up, there's a lot of John		    * G's for us to find. All you do is moan.			* I'm the one that has to live with what			 * you've done. I'm the one that has to put		    * it all together. You just wander around			* playing detective. You're living a dream,		   * kid. A dead wife to pine for and a sense		    * of purpose to your life. A romantic quest		   * which you wouldn't end even if I wasn't			* in the picture.							    *
You can't just take it!
A load of amphetamine I told him I had.
Gottingen.  That's in Sweden.
So what's gonna persuade Montoya to change off Sal Maguda running his deliveries...?
José Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.
They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment...
What do you think?
25% discount on the load.
Make it 35.
Right now.
It goes very fast.
The Keys?
You do business in Cuba with your husband?
Is it December?
Better than that.  We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  "And why," you're thinking, "would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?"  And the answer is, "of course" but also "no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can."
'Cause whatever can go wrong, will...?
Really?
Whenever.  Maybe later, maybe sooner.
Of course.
A few more moments, still in this business.  Then I'd find you.
We could try to run loads into these guys.  Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida.  Into this group.
No.  You gonna give me phony reassurances?
Good.  So let's go...
Hit a couple of jazz clubs.  Fell back to her place.
Verdado where?
And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
Chill out Sonny.
Never heard of him.
Have faith.
Alonzo, what's goin' on?!
White supremacist types.
...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said.
Switek pulling this off...?  That's not faith; that's delusional...
Bored.
"Salutations from the south..."
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
Uh-uh.  No predetermined places and times to meet.  Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal...
Beg pardon, ma'am?
Lotta rich women back there...
Why, that's perfectly dreadful. Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Talking helps. Don't talk, you get muddled in your head. Hey! Now you just look at this here!
Beat your butt, you don't lemme think!
Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx. Don't mind if I do.
Well, I hope you know what you're in for. I'm a very dangerous person. Someone does me bad like you. If I caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead Ratso long about now. Hear?
I'm impressed. You're a killer.
I been sick. Hold this, will ya?
And end up a hunchback like my old man? You think I'm crippled? You shoulda caught him the end of a day.
Did I say that? Did I?  It don't say nothing about you...
Well, what the hell, I got nothing better to do.
Twenty bucks...
You couldn't lift fly specks from a sugar bowl. Can you hold this?
And what?
What'll happen. I mean what they do to, you know, do with you -- if you can't -- ah, Christ!
Shee-it. You believe all you read?
Gin's okay.
It's so exciting. New York. The mad forward thrust of everything. My sense of time here is completely altered.
What?
Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
You want me to leave?
I'm going to Florida.
Money from home, see, there's your strength, you put things in earthy terms any man can understand, son. I warn you I'm gonna use you, I'm gonna run you ragged!
You got it.
Get lost.
Hamidou.  Chief of the Guards. Don't fuck with him. He almost killed an Italian dude couple months ago.  Bad news. He try anything with you?
History, man, history. How much?
Where?
Billy?
Yeah. How's Mom?
I know.
Yes...?
Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?
Would you recognize him again?
Stupid.
I was just going to sell it to friends.  I'm not a pusher, honest.
Yeah.  That guy who beat me?  I feel stoned.
Thank you.
What do you mean?
What?  You gotta be joking.
Whose?
Then I'll cut his balls off.
Look, I think I'm going to have to go to the john again.  You go on through, I'll catch up.
My passport!
I know exactly what you feel but you must not worry, we are acting immediately, we get the right court, the right judge,  I arrange everything - just right.  And I think we get you bail. If very bad, maybe twenty month sentence... But I think we get you bail...
Who?
Oh Yesil...  Yesil's his name but I...don't know anything... 'bout...Yesil...
Lady...
Triad, Chinese Mafia. They bring people from Yunan. Slave labor...  Reverend Harry Wong, a preacher had the flophouse fronting for them. No sign of him.
Take a look.
I think so. One right, two lefts...
20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore.
Oh, Jesus!!
You don't do that, we're on the wrong track.  You...
Don't get kinky here...
Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
Maybe they lied to you.
I know.  But if it was carrying something...there's a chance you could have been exposed.
That's why we should do it now.
Ah...
We can do it!
Gross. What is it?
How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
It's fine.
The phones are working?
Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
You'd be amazed at what some people will believe.
Great.
Now don't josh. This is a very big day for you, Paul. Here. You just sit tight, and I'll set everything up.
Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?
I know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right.
You--fooler...!  Did I do good?
I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written.
I can't write this anymore.
I think you're right.
Why would you lose me?
You've been out of your room.
Why would I run away? I'm a writer, Annie--it's all I am--and I've never written this well--even you said that this is my best, didn't you?
That's disgusting.
But the time is now. Soon others will come.
This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?
I'm glad you like it.
Could be--or a rotten branch or a mountain lion could have landed on it. Could be a lot of things.
That's nice.
What thing?
There's that spice again.
Yes.
You think he might be missing?
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
Newspapers?
I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.
I'm delighted the critics are liking it, and I hope the people like it, too. But it's not why I wrote the book.
Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks.
Now you've hurt me, Paul.
Not possible..
Well, you've thorough about it, at any rate.
How I usually find you, Nyah.
Only because..it's spring..chalk it up  - to spring fever.
What are you talking about?
In downtown Sydney for a start.
Yep.  You've provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer.
She wouldn't  be here if it wasn't for you, Hunt.  from this moment you're responsible for what happens to her, and if you're looking out for her well-being, I suggest you advise her to pick up the gun and bring it to me.  Ball's in your court, Hunt.  What've you got to say? Nyah's waiting for your answer.
In other words, you're calling her a flake.
More like two-two point two million.
Then we got'em!
What manic invents  disease like that in the first place?  Why would he do it?
He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together.
Listen to what?
Your help?  What are you talking about?
Care to wait a decent interval?
The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
That they're lying.
So would I.  But it's not mine to give.
You don't trust me.
Just like old times?
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
Like what?
Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
Then you do think it was Ambrose.
Do you?  Even assuming you're able to prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you've now got an additional problem.  You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte.  If Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now, he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall's blood to market.
She sacrificed herself..
Aren't you even curious?  About why she did it?
Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.
No.  After you've lived with <i>Chimera</i> for twenty hours, nothing can save you.  Not even...<i>Bellerophon.</i>
I'm fine..
All storage and production of Chimera is done here, in this lab on the forty-second floor, the heart of the building.
I'm not waiting 48 hours.  When we're done at Biocyte, if she's not out of Ambrose's, I'm going in and getting her out.
Dimitri Miediev...Dimitri Miediev...
But why tell us?
Stay out of this. OR Lachez - moi OR T'agueue
Roger that.
I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio.  He said someone was...
What?
Take off your God damn coat!
Who is they, who is they?
No one sent me!  We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --!
We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
Is this the only way?
Two cars.  Where are you?
Ethan?
Claire.
No sir.
You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.
Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
It's Hunt.  What do you need for a pinpoint?  Been watching a little T.V., have you?
I can't just hack my way inside.  There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone.  I'd have to be physically at the terminal.
Because if you knew what you were getting into, you never would have done it.
You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox.
And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
Because I can deliver the actual NOC list.  The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.
Mm - Hmmm...
How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
We'll see.
We're not outta here yet.
Jack.
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
Why?
You wish to meet Max?  This is the price of admission.
I don't communicate very well through a shroud.
I thought I'd take some now.
Oh?  What's the problem?
I remember..
We donít have to, Jim.  Heíll come after us.
And a lonely ass.
Itís not working.
Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain.
Well, what do you wanna talk about!
I don't know, Rose. I don't know where I've been, and I don't know where I'm going.  You should have your eyes opened for you, my friend.
I don't wanna talk about it.
You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.
Bed.
I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
Let's go tell your Mother.
You're my father.
Good morning, Lucy.
I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come.
I have no life.
I like it well done.
No!
I was dead, too.
You're trying to make me feel guilty.
That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
Alright.
He was having some fun. Yeah, well he's dead.  Come on, let's go in.
I couldn't believe it! I didn't think she was going to die. I knew she was sick...
I wanna go home.
How can you ask me that?
We're here.
Why?
Alright. A month. In a month.
In time, you will drop dead, and I will come to your funeral in a red dress.
No. He don't.
Cosmo's cheating on me.
No. Are you drunk?
Oh God, that's too bad.
You gotta date?
What sins have you to confess?
You should think about this.
If I hit the stick too hard, the apple will split. If I am too timid, the apple will fall off the stick.
Did you see the moon last night?
Where is she?
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
It's late.
Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life.
Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
Sure!
She didn't hear me. She asked me to repeat, so she could understand what I said. But I wouldn't repeat it. Outta shyness. So I'm a bachelor.
She was just too young for you.
I guess you can't invite me in?
Good night.
I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
Is who down there?
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
I knew she had it.
Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?
Not at all.  They could be carried.
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
I am your king!
Well, how did you become king, then?
Oh!
We are now no longer the Knights Who Say Ni!
How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?
What, "is"?
What?
What!  Just a flesh wound. 
Had enough ... ?
Well, what are you then?
Bedevere, my Liege.
How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
I warned you!
:Well - I can't just say:  "Hey, Man!'
... But all the decision of that officer ...
I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!
Well, don't. |      I really don't know where all this got started. It's like those miserable psalms.  they're so depressing. Now knock it of
What is your favorite colour?
Why?
Really, I feel fine, sir.
I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.
But I don't like her.
Don't like her?   What's wrong with her?  She's beautiful ... she's rich ... she's got huge tracts of land ...
Look, it's  simple.  Just stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room.
Until you, or anyone else ...
What?
Quick!
No, really, I can cope.  I can handle this lot easily!
No.  It's unhealthy.
... I Bet you're gay.
They're doctors?
Did I tell you?  Did you listen to me?  Oh no, no, you knew better didn't you?  No, it's just an ordinary rabbit isn't it.  The names you called me.  Well, don't say I didn't tell you.
Bravely ran away, away.
It's better than shovelling horse shit.
Aye, but will they?
You know nothing about her!
I can't move to tidy.
I would talk to her myself, but she won't listen to me.  She must be persuaded, by someone she respects, to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops.
Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
You will await your orders like everyone else.  Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement.
We are all of us subject to forces beyond our control, Mr Brown, even you.
Dare say you can be taught.
If you hunt, you kill.
I'm fine.
This is the top.
I do what I do.
I said.  I serve the Queen.
The threat.  I tell them, but they don't see it.
You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish it.  The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank--
Yes.
Craobhan-geanmchno...  How can I possibly say that with a straight face?!
To keep out the cold.
Has someone seen to those bruises?
I will not hear any more about my safety!!  You made me a promise and now you have broken it!
But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli.
I have asked him to show you a little of Highland life while you are with us at Balmoral.
Who?
A few days...  When he heard, the Prince of Wales threw the bust from the window of the Royal Gallery.  It took four hours to gather the fragments.
Cold is good!
The same, your Majesty.
I don't know, ma'am.  He was observed earlier, I believe.
Of course, at once.
Is it not enough that She is uncheered and unguided that she should also have to suffer these malicious rumors?!  I am not a fool.  I know there are those in the establishment too afraid to attack me and so they attack my dearest friends. Sometimes -- I feel that Brown is all I have left of Albert.  And now they attack Brown too.
What is it?
I have a letter, ma'am.
From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
Then why are you not with him?
Maybe he's not dead.
Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
There's something wrong with ARCADE. The game's alive somehow...
Did you play ARCADE last night?
But you always lie, so you didn't come from there.  That means the city on the left must be the City of Truth.
No, in person.  Now.
Turn if off!
No.  Look, I know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway...  I think the game's alive somehow.
Quiet.  I do have parents, you know.
Right.  And then communication satellites, and then anywhere.
Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
What?
I was afraid you'd say that.
Everything.
Yeah.  The Inferno.
I know how to do this!  I'm good at these games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.
What?
Got it.
Screamer.
We don't have a choice!
Sign me up.
I'm going home Cynthia.
I'm going home. I'll call you later.
What do you mean "you know"?
You gotta be kidding?
I'll call him, then call you back...If you want you could stay at my place.
Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that Beverly Hills Hotel.
What did I say?
Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.
So, what did they say?
Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher.
Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.
Yes, there was.
Oh...
No...I need to sleep.
We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
Maybe it's not me.
"I came back. I thought that's what you wanted."
"You know what I want...it's not that difficult."
"Before what?"
I'm all right.
Okay.
Do you know them?!
Let's see if we have a pass for Betty Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good luck Miss. Elms.
It must be just so pathetic being you. Sure Billy, grab your dog we'll eat in the van.
Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
Where at?
No...
Yeah, I'd say that's it.
No one has a gun to your head.
I made this place..... now listen to me. I'll get out of this room, we have bigger troubles than this....
I don't know.
Give me a fucking.....
Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?
It's a tax write off for John C. McCay.
I'm leaving.
If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here.
Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?
Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
I was hired in and started to do the boring old work routine. I was originally brought in as a technical advisor. First Bank had sponsored my scholarships.
Fine...
Let's go.
There's one more person here for me to visit.
Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
Because of my charming personality ?
You were one of those guys that played Dungeons & Dragons with real swords, weren't you.
Don't have to tell me twice.
I said NO.
Got it.
When I think you're ready.
Yeah, maybe.... Let's start the background checks. Let's see where they live and what kind of security systems....
Fire the whole division. We're moving more of the operations division into Manhattan anyway. Whoever is left over from the conversion is no longer needed. We already have all the key people here. Anyone else is expendable.
Yes sir, I do. Last night's, fresh from the Park.
Thank you , sir. Sir, may I ask you a question ?
Sir ?
I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
Do you think the assistant, what's his name...
Zach, my boy ! How is tonights adventure going ?
Fantastic ! A little faster sweetheart.
Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.
What ?????
Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I guess the boss man wasn't as tough as I thought.
Ach ! How will you know if they've made it ?
The power went out in half the park.
It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?
Wake up, we're in trouble.
Who was that guy anyway ?
Were you involved in the incident where that guy killed himself in his office ?  I am sorry. Perhaps we should have dinner tonight to.... discuss your future.
Look, Miss. I know you're still upset about that incident in Chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business. We don't have time to play nursemaid to every single Tom Dick and Harry.
Are you writing a poem?
You're Vada right?
Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
I don't think you're very polite.
Yeah, well I don't think you're very grateful. A lot of people in your position would say &quot;thank you&quot;.
Me, I'll know!
Pommeroy...he may or may not be driving a black 54 Ford Pickup.  Monday.
I'm leaving Sunday.
Could you hold on for a second? 
Well not far, just down the hall. Plus Grammoo's room's a lot bigger, and you get a view of the whole neighborhood.
So, what's on your mind?
Seriously?
Honey, ahh, guys don't wanna appear over anxious, so if you think there's a boy that might like you, let him know that you like him, so he won't feel he's taking such a risk when he's thinking of asking you out.
What??
Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...
Give my love to Shelly.
If I eat it I'll throw up.
Look we react to every kick this baby gives, maybe Vada's trying to tell us something too.
Hillary Mitchell? How's she?
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
Honey I'd be proud to be your father, really. It just isn't so.
I know that.
Oh God, he's coming over here, act natural, totally natural.
Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.
Hi.
It's no problem, I had a mother once myself.
Are you Jeffrey Pommeroy?
I...ahhh...umm...I'm thirsty.
Don't wake up Vada.
You think this is easy for me? You go out on the town and I get to be the bad guy. Look I don't want you to be some punk hoodlum delinquent but I can't do my job as a parent if you don't do your job as a kid.
He said it was a gift.
It's not funny! I mean what am I gonna do? Without that yearbook I'm lost. I can't just walk around town looking for someone with a Wilson High School Letter sweater!!!
Change my name.
Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.
Owh...
Jerk! You IDIOT!!!
That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws.  My hands fit.
What do you think?
Really?
But we wouldn't really be related right?
Good. I mean...
I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.
No...it was me. And I'm sorry mom, really, ju...just tell me what to do, I'll do anything.
Ten bucks.
For the mini-bike fund.
Well I know you're not crazy about taking Vada around tomorrow, so...I just want you to know I appreciate it though.
No problem.
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
I should do this myself.
Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly.
He was caressing.
God? No I didn't think you'd want to invoke God Rose, because he saw even more than I did. ROSE Look Phil, if you want the rights of a husband, you're gonna have to ask me something but if not, you're gonna have to get accustomed to the rights of what you are.
Anyone with taste, anyone with breeding.... A gentleman, would choose British racing green, with maybe a tan interior...but when you buy a red car, with a black interior and wire wheels, you have one thing on your mind and one thing only and I'm too much of a gentleman to say what that one thing is...in front of the children.
I'm saying he asked me out for coffee, like a real date, when was the last time you did that?
...so I guess I'll always...teach...you know...'cause it makes a good relief from the operating-room, I feel I have an obligation...
Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?
Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so.
I know, look at his little hands.
All right, here.
WHAT?
Vada there is no chicken bone stuck in your throat.
Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?
Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....
I promise i'll take good care of these people, they deserve it, they're dead, all they've got left is their looks.
Well the other night at dinner...
I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
I wrote that.
Why d'you think these seats were empty.
You can look in the bathroom if you want. People are always curious about that, like what happens when you flush.
Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.
Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic.
Yes.
Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.
Pointing upwards Look...
I love this guy! 
Dad??
Why?
Yes.
He was allergic to bees.
He's okay isn't he?
Get away, get away!!
Do you miss her?
I'm very nervous.
Look if you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product, support me for a while!
Thank you. Bye.
It's summer! You're kids! Go play!
Oh, Vada...
That's Suzanne.  She and I are gonna be married this Fall.
Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.
I am.
Come on sweetie.
Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.
You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late.
Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars, I haven't gotten there yet.  All right, open your eyes.
This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit.  We used to be married.
I don't want, I don't need your help....
I'm eleven and a half.
I think it should be outlawed.
Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.
Reel it in.  He's only tiny, throw him back.
Uh huh.
What's wrong with your eyes?
It's my mother.
It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.
What?
Pointing There's a beehive right there!
Hurry!!!
Wow, was it a decoder ring?
Okay, seeya.
I dunno..
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
But, I don't know how.
Umm, Ummmmm
I'm just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective.
I'll call George's parents. Tell them I need a best man who actually looks after me.
He says, "Swear.  When we're both 28, if we've never been married... we marry each other!"
You're butting in.
I KNOW THAT!  I WAS DISTRACTED BY GRIEF!
That was Thursday.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, WE'RE HAVING A SERIOUS CONVERSATION!
I think the best part of marrying this guy is finding you.
Which was the disqualifying factor?
So your honeymoon is exactly where?
I'm not joking.  I had to face up to all my competitive drives, and believe me, I've got 'em.
I just think you're wrong, is all.
Exactly.
What you said.  Make it appear that he's doing you the favor.
He won't get mad, huh?
If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
She's too genuine.
What's next?
That would be a girl.  I don't even know.
I switched that around when you weren't looking.
Does it, really? How come you never took some sell-out establishment job? You had plenty of chances!
Like I said, dazzling.
Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing business.  Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there...
Love doesn't have to be right. It just has to be love.
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
ARE YOU CRAZY?
The pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus.
... and you knew about this.
What do you have to buy?
Grand Old Opera --
Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.
Come on.
We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come.
You'll have to speak up.
Oh just about everything, I guess. Those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. They keep taking things out. She's going to come home an egg shell. Tough, though.. She's tough.
I'll tell Ester, she'll be thrilled I saw you again.
Not a thing, Barnett, really. I need a little information. But, ah, it can wait.
Okay. Thanks.
Sure thing. Put them here... I'll take them.
Hi, Sherry.
Let me see if I can get the doctor hold on one second.
Suits me.
It's hard to say. Doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. All it was was appendix.
Well I've been following him around Just listening to him --He says he can really win -- I bet he can too - -
You must really like him.
I haven't gotten into politics yet. I'm still into music --except for you. You're into politics.
We don't mess with accessories.
Do you carry door handles?
The car broke down.
Next you'll be sick.
I don't know his first name.
I don't think so.
I want to get the dog off my bed.
Bye.
Yes. Who's this?
I'm here.
I'm not sure. Where?
Well, I met you that afternoon in the control room and we...
I don't know who you are.
Oh.
Thirty?
I'm not sure...
Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?
Linnea?
Hundreds of times.
Where are you going?
Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?
You do?
I know a couple.
No kidding -- Wait till I tell Linnea. Who?
Peter Finch -- he's English.
Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
What was the color of Tim's belt?
Is that a fact? Well then, Grace, could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in?
Yes, you are.
I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.
I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long.
Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time... Very good. You do keep up with the headlines.
I can appreciate that.
You've heard of it?
Wagons, hooaaa!
Everybody knows who you are. You're famous.
Yes.
I'm keen with anticipation.
Then was it worth it?
Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.
No fuckin' way!
I don't give a damn if a million United States marines, all whistling the halls of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin' down this alley any second. There ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm leaving you. And that's that!
It's like this, Wayne. Two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. These two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there. Now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move.
And they made the first move?
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
They actually apologized.
Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.
Wayne---
Roger, I'm starting to get pissed. Just drop this fuckin' donut shit, and gather your gear.
Rockin'!
And where do you keep Mickey?
Wayne Gayle!
Tomorrow.
Well, basically, what we did was put part of the old show on first...
Slate it.
Never is a very long time, Wayne. A word only the weak use. I'm not a sore loser. Even if I don't have a leg to stand on, I'm going to get up and fight this world until I'm on top again.
That sounds great. Look, I don't want any of this to intimidate you. This is not going to be a big deal. This is going to be very easy.  I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You guys get your equipment ready, power up the van and confirm a transmission code for the remote. Julie come with me.
I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. If I were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig.
Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I feel it.
Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes.
Stay up here and finish your interview, I've got to see what the hell's going on down there before I can take responsibility for you to film there.
Now, if you want to work like a real nigger, you can always go out and chop cotton.
Thanks, Duff. You' a nice guy. Not like Frankie.
What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
No, boy. Thirty-eight cents worth of gas. And watch you don't make it thirty-nine.
Goddamnit, nigger - you must think you're white! Who d'you think you are - king of Harlem?
Want to talk to you.
What d'you think?
Where was that?
Walker and Williams.
Anderson.
'Bout time you showed. Door's open.
Where's Wilma?
She done moved to Detroit.
Like where?
Well, he worked around.
No. Just me.  Me an' her.
It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
Went to college, huh?
Well, that's a funny thing to say.
I like a place with lots of life.
That's fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble.
No, on the porch.
Oh yeah, and then what?
Well, it ain't that good up there neither. Might as well make it here. 'Course I ain't really makin' it now.
She don't mean nothin' to me. That's all over.  Hell, baby - I'm askin' you to marry me. I guess you want a big scene, huh?
Let's just see how the two of us make out first, huh?
My kids want me to teach them.
Huh?
Don't look so scared.
What about your boy?
I don't think that'll happen.
'Round town.
Let's go, Jocko. The man's got homework.
Man, you must be plumb outa your mind! You'll be makin' twen'y bucks a week, if you're lucky.
Wouldn't have known you.
Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.
Beat it!
Yeah, sure. Good luck.
Going back, huh?
Don't be too hard on him.
Guess it's never been easy.
Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
Aw, I do. But 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin'. It's the whites that need it real bad.
It ain't in me.
I guess I'll rob a bank.
You're breaking my heart.  Got to see a man about a dog.
What's the matter now?
You hate Raoul?
So don't pull this cowboy shit now. You'll give him a target.  You'll get yourself killed.  Just keep talking.
I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
Splendid. We'll prepare a welcome for them.
Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. When it's over, I inject you with the antitoxin.
What?
Very well.
What does this have to do with me?
Sense/Net's corporately financed. Too corrupt to be trusted. You of all people should know that.
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.
Sense/Net taped a full spectrum personality construct on McCoy six months before his death. Everything Dixie was -- everything Dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct.  Of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of Sense/Net's.
What about McCoy?
Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
My problem, Mr. Case, is simply that I am a soulless bastard.
Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
It's Case. Remember me?
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
Jah guides us.
Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
I have to figure out how to penetrate this thing, Dix... Crack its ice. We gotta get close enough to log the pattern.
Slow, but good. I got a nice safe blind spot going. C'mon.
I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive.
The angels... I think they're calling your name.
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
I had to limit your options.
I'll give it my best shot, mother fucker.
Maybe something's onto him.
What's that supposed to mean?
Couple of days. They'll examine you.
What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
So you're a wire junkie.
Won't that mean you're dead?
Okay fine. Let's get this over with.
It sounds like you.
Case...
I don't sleep much. You packed?
What went down between you and Riviera?
I know you have. C'mere.
Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom?
What?
Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom.
College?
Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge.
Yeah, I know.
Well I'm so glad that you guys are.
Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.
YOU KNIT?
Roger in Op/Ed.
And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?
I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--
At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
But I don't want it straightened out.
He's my teacher!
And that's the best part.  "Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it!
I'll tell you a story. It's about this shy copy editor who makes a mockery of herself and her boss when she completely botches her first assignment as a reporter.
You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.
Better person than I.
See!
This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
Don't you remember what they called you?
Good.
Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
Yes, desperately.
This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!
Sorry. Forgetful.
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you.
But now you don't have to--
I just can't look at you the same way.
I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
Rob, I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me and you. Once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex.
Where?
I know.
I can't help it.
Whatever it is, it's none of your concern.
He's conducting experiments of his own.
Experiments?
It's getting there.
You got a problem with me, Grady?
Not too far.  My folks bought a place over on Elm Street.
He must've been working late and some fruitcake came in and sliced him up like a kielbasa.  In the shower!  Left bloody footprints all over the...
I'm sorry...
It's happening again.
You mean a shithead.
Uh-uh.  Before my time.
You don't have to.  You just have to believe in energy.
C'mon, cut it out.
Maybe it only happens when you're sleeping - that's the way it was with Nancy, wasn't it?
I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.
Hi, Kerry.
Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.
You're going out?
The maid packed a suitcase.  Teresa!  Teresa?
First door up the stairs.
I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
Research.
Jennifer --
No, she's right.
Don't fucking humor us.  We're not in the mood.
I don't know.
I lost too much over this already.  I'm through with it.
Nancy...
But nightmares are the common thread?
Anything?
So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
Make sure to check in with Max, he'll give you the 25 cent tour.
Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?
Well, we've got --
Never been here before?
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
The truth.
This isn't possible.  And even if it is...what the hell am I doing here?  Did you drag me in here too?
Anything?
All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.
They used to keep a spare key.
Mary Helena.
A young girl on the staff was accidentally locked in here over the holidays.  The inmates managed to keep her hidden for days.  She was raped...hundreds of times. When they found her, she was barely alive...and with child.
My God.
You must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground.
Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help.  I know these kids.  I don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published.
C'mon.
Good.  You conquer the demon, but your horse is sinking in the bog.  What do you do?
You're right.  I told you I was bad at acting.
Night, night, Honey.
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
Oh... no one... no one.  Just some... guy from the past.  I don't know what he's doing here.  Bit of an awkward situation.
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
Thanks.  I'll think about it.
Do you always say 'no' to everything?
You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.
Don't worry about it.  I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.
Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.
Obviously.  Very difficult.
You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
Okay.
And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
No, you were brilliant
Why?
Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'
My son's name is Johnny?
What do you think?
Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.
I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.
Big feet -- large shoes.
You have a stunt bottom?
The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home.
Well, don't over-do it.  I don't want people saying, 'There goes that famous actor with the big, fat girlfriend."
Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
He wouldn't say.
Yes, I think that one may be.
Yes -- sort of...
No -- it's my 22nd.
Yes.  What do you think?
And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
I did.
Who?  Someone famous?
Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, Martin?
Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
May I help you, sir?
Yes, she is fairly fabulous.
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
Right.  No one else?
Absolutely not.
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
Yes.
Bad news.
Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,	what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize.
I mean, the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. I know that to be the case, but the way in which you broached it, if that's your idea of teaching me something...
Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function...  Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question of... Existence... Relationship... Function... Confront... Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... Somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect...
Y-y-y-yes...
Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
Sh-sh-she did! Everybody did!
Who? Tell me!
Mister McMurphy!
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
Yes, ma'am.  Lead the way, Sam.
Not at all, Mister McMurphy...
I wanna report a robbery!
Yeah, yeah, the hell with that crap! The World Series is goin' on right' now an' that's therapy also!
You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
Well, put 'er there, Billy boy, my name's McMurphy.
Yeah, well, let me tell ya somethin'... While I was up there gettin' in-lightened, I came up with one hellava plan...
P-p-p-please duh-duh-duh-duh t-t tell, M-M-M-Miss R-R-Ratched, y-y you don't need to!
Whaddaya talkin' about? There's at least twenty guys in there. Let's wake 'em up and get this party on the road.
Well, okay, but I just want to look at the facilities. That's all.
Charlie, ya can't ever let those goons outta ya sight! Understand!
Come here a minute, Cheswick. You, too, Sefelt. Hey, all you guys, come over here, I wanna show you somethin'.
Me, too...
Your buddy is callin' ya.
A pecking party?
She's not all that homely, Mister McMurphy. In fact, she must have been a rather beautiful young lady.
It is to me! An' if I hafta bust way outta this place to see it, I will!
I just started!
Why not?
Yeah, Mac?
Bye-bye.
Yeah, it's cold!
No.
Oh, what was that?
Poker!
I don't, Doc...
Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.
Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.
Stay back! Patients aren't allowed to enter the... Oh, stay back!
How do ya know that?
Shhhh. Time to say goodbye.
Breakfast! Hell, I know just the place where we can chow down an' thaw out before we shoot back on home. 'Kay?
Yeah, what's up?
Our prayers have been answered, Turkle! Our prayers have been answered!
Just great!  See ya around!
Hi.
Boogered!
Ya-hoo, let's'play ball!
This way, Mister McMurphy.
Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
No way...
At this hour?
Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...
Shhh, please, Miss. Keep it down...
Is he in an asylum?
You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...
Of course not.
I-- I must've misplaced it.
You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
Yes.
You're sure...
I've never been more sure of anything in my life.
My car bumper has never held a winning sticker.
I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.
A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.
But, Faith--
No, you gave a very convincing performance.  And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?
Oh, hi.  I'm an old high school buddy of Dwayne's.  I was in town this weekend, was hoping to stop by and surprise him. But I've gotta catch a plane so I'm afraid I'm not gonna be able to make it.
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
Does he love you?
Where's Positano?
Tell me.
I'd really rather not say.
Please.  I need to know.
You too.
I feel like the world's biggest idiot.
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
No, it isn't.  I called off my wedding all because of you.
How about the other one?  His friend.
Don't tell me, Oprah did a show--
Yeah.  I guess you're right.  I really like the wallpaper we picked out for the den.
Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.
Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him.
We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost.  Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.
What's that supposed to mean?...
Nothing.
Hi.  Where've you been?
Packing.
Why?
Okay, a lot of bad luck.  But that means the odds are probably in your favor now.  This is no time to give up.
I know, but...
What if he doesn't like me?
No, I think maybe you've been right.  I think I may have been too critical in the past.
Kate.
And we didn't have to bring another present?
He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.
We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.
That's all. Next witness!
The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that— he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.
I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local— that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady— well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out— we take our cut.
I'm not thirsty.
This is for you to figure out. You can have it your way or you can have it his way.  But you can't have it both ways.  Am I right, Sonny?
He probably gave 'em an argument.
Why me, Charley? I'd feel funny going in there.
Nolan? I knew he had guts but—
The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
Mm—hmmm.
Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
Don't say that!
What do you weigh these days, slugger?
Okay— I'll tell him I couldn't bring you in. Ten to one they won't believe it, but— go ahead, blow. Jump out, quick, and keep going... and God help you from here on in.
"In the church when you need me." Was there ever a saint who hid in the Church?
Hello, Edie.
I better get home.
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
What for?
I really don't know.
How do you like that one?
I don't know.
Isn't everybody part of everybody else?
Don't say that, Edie, don't...
I'm tryin' to keep you from being hurt— What more do you want?
I— I brought this for you, Terry. It was Joey's.  Yours is coming out at the elbows.
Go ahead, wear it.
The Father. The Father.
Don't tell me— don't tell me!
Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
Edie...
I mean it, let's get away from here, first Joey then Nolan, now Charley— and any minute... .  ...I'm frightened— I'm frightened.
I don't want to see you killed. I want to live with you. Live with you. Any place it's safe to walk the streets without... .
Get out of my way.
I thought you might want some hot coffee.
Six-toed cats. Assyrians. Abyssinians. It's the same difference. Well don't think this Terry Malloy is any six-toed cockeyed Assyrian. He's a bum. Charley and Johnny Friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.
You are like—
But you're the one I want to tell— what you said over Nolan— about keepin' silent when you know the score— I'm guilty— you hear me? I'm guilty... .
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
But it's my own brother they're askin' me to finger— and Johnny Friendly. His mother and my mother was first cousins. When I was this high he took me to the ball games... .
Is that all you've got to say to me, Father?
Give me that gun.
I can? Okay.  Okay...
You can bring a lawyer if you wish. And you're privileged under the Constitution to protect yourself against questions that might implicate you in any crimes.
You sure looked it. Something go wrong?
O.K., O.K., That's enough.
Yeah, once they're mated they stay together all their lives until one of 'em dies.
Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug somebody put on somebody... .  You think I should turn him in?
A cheese-eater!  You're kidding!
My favorite little cousin.
By way of Chicago?
I got it. Hot off the press.
Go on talkin'. You're talkin' yourself right into the river. Go on, go on... .
Not that free.
Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
What are you down here for— to see we don't make off with any of Mister Friendly's precious cargo?
..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain.
But does it have to be in a cemetery?
Okay.
Be careful!--They'll see you.
Don't let them hear you.
You're talking nonsense.
Tie them that they may watch.
A symbol, Master.
El Dia De Los Muertos...A celebration in her country.
When!?
Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World.  There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the law--all powerful. <b>No one</b> is to challenge that authority, <b>no one!</b>.  Is that understood?  It is my command.
Then cancel my order.
Oh, if there is only time!
I'm so frightened.
I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward.  It could be that <b>you</b> are that reward.
Hurt her?  Hell, it killed her!
Without the snake, of course.
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...
What?!
He didn't want me to.
He'd call every once in a while.
He called the day he escaped.
Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.
Listen, I'm the one help Jack escape from prison.  He tole me, I can't find him to see you.  So why don't you open this fucking door.  Okay?  So we can speak.
Go away, or I'll call the police.
Okay, honey, come on out of there.
I brought 'em, they're back at Glades in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take her car.
I want to talk to her again, that's all.  See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances.
You'll have to ask Glenn.  And most likely, he's on his way to Detroit, where we should be.
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
You at least bring the gun?
Sure looks that way.
She just sat there, looking right at me.
Love is funny.
Two hours.
Who says anybody's gonna be with us? I say we go to the fights tomorrow, find out what the Snoop's big plan is, then go in ahead of those guys -- <u>alone</u>.
I don't ski.
They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
And then they'll kill 'em.
At least.
Listen, Buddy, the shit that's about to go down, you'll be on the phone with your sister for a month.  Let me do this part alone.
Daniel Burdon, FBI.
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
Coming to the Okeechobee exit...
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
Daniel.  Listen --
What?  Is that what you're calling me about?
That's all I wanted to know.
The manager's door is metal.
Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.
I'll need a last known address.
Wait, I know him --okay?
Low class of people there, Snoop.
Just like it.  Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?
That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight.
Nervous?
One I gave him, yeah.  Fuck...
You don't act like it.
What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
We still talk, though.
It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana.
Really.
It smelled.
No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
It's your game.  I've never played this before.
Why are you mad?
I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen.
Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on.
You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!
Use your head.  The guys got five million lying around his house, you really think he's gonna tell some motormouth he just met in prison about it?
The backseat.
How many?
You know who they are?
Any time.
You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen.
First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year, study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz... then come back, maybe take some tennis lessons.
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
For a time.
Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
I wanna talk to you about a job.
It's lilac, man, the color, and the style's made known by Deion and other defensive backs in the pros.  I could be one of them living out here with doctors of my race and basketball players.  Okay, here comes Mr. Ripley's house up on the left.  Yeah.  The brick wall.  There's his drive, right there.
I don't have to prove shit to you. The Ripley job is <i>my</i> job.  You're either in or you're not.  You wanna pop some crack dealer pissed you off, that's your problem, not mine.
I think you're forgetting, this is my car.  I drove it up here.
Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
I can tell.
You wanted to tussle, we tussled.
You a lawyer?
Your dog was killed?
Then they're not separated, are they?
Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights.
You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators.
Tell you what, you're a good girl, you might get another one for Christmas.
No?
I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.
He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.
Well, I need that...
Where you been hiding, Dick?
He was that good?
Hale-what?
You guys are new?
Well, you p-puked on his feet.
Yeah, but he was wearing shoes!
I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
Danny, you know how many times I saw you come to school with a black eye or a busted nose, and couldn't do a thing about it -- for you, or for your mother... or your father, with his lungs scorched out with mustard gas, and more left of his lungs than there was of his spirit? You've made your sacrifice, Danny.  It's time I made mine.
I didn't mean it.
So what are you saying?
Fuck you.
How sweet.  Is that when you put the move on her?
They're coming around for another pass. You got extra weapons and ammo?
What's between you and her is between you and her.  But here's what's between you and me.  Everybody has a hero, Danny. And you're mine.
We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
Thank you, Sir.
I want to introduce a couple of people. Doc White is a flight surgeon; he has volunteered for gunnery training so that he can go on the mission, because we can't spare the weight of an extra man.
Win?
I'm Evelyn.  And I'm just a nurse.  But I'm not playing golf, and that cut needs sewing, or else it's gonna make a big lumpy scar.  Whatta ya say?
What do you get for winning?
Nice to meet you, Betty.
Do one thing for me, before you go.
How did you?...
...Survive?  I jumped in a patch of fog, and nobody could see me.  I hit the water hard.  And it was so...cold.
I'm so sorry for what you must've gone through, but I'm back.
Don't worry about that.  Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.
Of course I forgive you.  I know what you feel for Danny is real.  And your choice is your choice.
I have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.
We must go ahead.  This is our moment.
God help them.
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
That never changes.  You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore.
Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?
Peggy Sue!
You're probably the only one who could carry it off.
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
Well, besides Charlie, of course.
What happened?
Look, Carol, maybe Walter's done you a big favor. You always said you wanted to get out of town. Go for it. And be happy, goddamnit, I'm rooting for you.
That's disgusting!
I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?
You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.
Why?
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
How could you possibly know what I've been going through?
Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
I'll just set it right here.
I'll never give up.
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
That's a day's work. But if that's what you want, maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday.
It must run in the family.
What're you doing here anyway?
Coffee and a donut.
Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
What are you shooting for?
Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.
Mom, is there any coffee left?
Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?
Thank God for that.
Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
I think they're going to deregulate it.
Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
Evelyn, take her to her room!
This is your great invention?  Would you wear those things?
Please don't shout.
Of course, dear. You're home now.
Oh.	Ah...recently. All the kids drink it.
What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
What do you mean?
We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come.
Why not? They're my favorite.
You have an incredible memory.
Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop.
Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.
Dancing with you.
You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
Are you doing some kind of science project?
Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
How, did you know about my grandfather?
What if it's beyond science? What it it's God?
But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
Richard, take it easy.
Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
We were lying in the sand. It was my eighteenth birthday... We were so awkward... I would have married him anyway...
No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
God damn it Gus, you dug up my wife! What the fuck is going on around here?!
I don't know what you expected to find, Matthews. There's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death...
Yes... why?
What do they do up there?
Oh, you know... drink beer, tell ghost stories. They try and spook each other out, talking about zombies and things...  It's no big deal, Chase. I did it when I was young.
I had a little run-in with Zowie.
I'll be fine, Dad.
You alright?
Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.
"Out." Well that's great, Geoff.  Look, I've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but I'm not going to stand for crap like this. I don't care if it's Halloween... it's a school night, and if you do this again...
I'm not hungry.
You think he'd believe it if he did?
Couple minutes. I saw the last shot. That was pretty cool.
You'll never find it in the dark.
There won't be a next time, I guarantee it.
I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.
That's right. We're on the Positive Plan. You don't have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness.
Bearing in mind that Bill Wright, the chairman of MacroSystems, is a close, personal friend of mine... which side of this mess would <u>you</u> desire to be on, Andy? And don't allow my very tight, personal relationship with Bill to influence your answer in any way.
If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit?
Uh, yeah.
We?
Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.
Continue.
I dove back into work, everything was fine. Until the lesions started...
Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.
Rayisha. Very nice.
Beckett?
For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.
I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...
I know a good probate lawyer.
You're ready, don't worry.
What impressed you about him?
What kind of person is that?
Possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of the law. A razor sharp litigator, a genuine leader, gifted at bringing out the very best in others. An awesome ability to illuminate the most complex of legal concepts to colleagues, courtrooms, the person on the street.  The kind of person who plays three sets of tennis but doesn't sweat. But underneath the elegant surface, was an adventurous spirit.
No. I didn't.
What makes you an excellent lawyer?
If it please the court, I'd like to ask Mr. Beckett to remove his shirt, so that the jury can have an <u>accurate</u> idea of what we're talking about.
Catch me later, I'll be here. And tell Amy, I love her painting, it's on my wall.
Have you ever been to the Apollo Cinema on Sansom Street?
That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.
In some situations.
Isn't it true you have spent your life pretending to be something you're not, so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you?!
Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread.
Hi, Mom. It's me.
Yes.
What did you say?
I'll withdraw.  You were aware, when you worked with Maria Torres, that she had AIDS, correct?
I'm not worried. What are you doing?
We won.
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
Second.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... do you think... ? You think <u>I'm</u>...  ... gay?
Do I look gay to you? Relax.
Take it as a compliment. Geesh.
Give me the camera, Joe.
Lisa, c'mon. One guy sticking his dick in another guy's mouth? It's disgusting.
Night, honey.
Why didn't you cross at the crosswalk?
Tell Iris all about it.  Take good care of Mrs. Finley, Iris.  Beckett, come in.
We stuck his head in the latrine, after ten of us had used it.
But didn't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct?
You had one guy "like that?"
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  Where you goin'?
It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just....
'Mean the whispers?
Show me your eyes.
Get out of our way.
'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.
It's starting....
Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.
I know what's in here!
Not sure. Ten?
Can we switch?
Hey, me. Over here.
Little swamp-flu from the Conga system. Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.
Which means he went toward sunrise.
Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me what....
I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --
60 years ago.
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
Smoke screen for what?
We're just burnin' light here.
Riddick. <u>Riddick</u>.
Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in the fucking --
Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai', wait. <u>I'm Owens</u>. Right?
70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to level this beast out!
You know who Muhammad was?
"Some prophet guy." And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of God.
Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more space 'tween us and them.
And pointless.
He will be with us. Nonetheless.
Well, what's it look like now?
Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you?
<u>Trawl</u> with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.
So which one caught your eye?
Don' look, don' look, don' look....
What's one more to you? Like <u>this</u> is the one that sends you to Hell?
Yes, sir, so it was -- thanks to you. But not before I discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the Sacred Scrolls were written ...
I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts. They're worthless.
No sir, I haven't forgotten.
It empties into a sea some miles from here. That's where the cave is.
Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
No creature can survive in that part of the Forbidden Zone. I've been there. I've seen it.
Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.
You're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet. Your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries. Even if you could get back, they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree.
Hmph.
Very well. I suggest we go and look at them.
I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
Huh?
Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do.
To Earth! That we've landed!
I'm prepared to die.
And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
Let's take a look.
Yes, I can do that.
Keep moving. We can't turn back now.
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
Identify him, then. Speak to him.
A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
Cease fire! Withdraw!
No, thanks. I'll take freedom.
Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.
The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.
Except that he's also the Chief Defender of the Faith.
Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
How the hell did he get away?
Fuckers returned fire soon as we lit 'em up. Hard core fuckin' NVA. They got their shit together.
YOU AIN'T A FIRING SQUAD, YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!
Shit. Get your boots on Martin, next time I catch you putting mosquito repellent on your fuckin' feet I'm gonna courtmartial your nigger ass.
Don you worry Bunny, youse a killer anyway.
Okay, here it is - one, we got gooks in the fuckin' perimeter.
They're scared? What about me! I'm sick of this shit man, I'm sick of this shit! They don't want us here! Who do you think they're fighting for! GET OUTTA THERE!
Feelin' good's good enough.
Barnes believes in what he's doing.
Well sometimes a man jes don' wanna go back. How you gonna talk to civilians man? People back in the world just don't give a shit, y'know what I mean, to them you're a fuckin' animal is all -
Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
What are you talking about! 
Merle? Jesus!... Patty?
Barnes took a bullet right there. At Ia Drang Valley...  And the cocksucker SURVIVED - that's BAAAD man. That's his high, baby. High on WAR!
I'm going to Vancouver, Mr. Mitchell.
Perhaps I don't take it so lightly.
Is it? I expected to go to the Vancouver Royal. Should I have a reservation?
I really don't know.
I don't know.
Very nice Mitchell turns.
Thank you.
Suppose I hadn't known that immigration inspector? Hadn't put in a good word for you?
I think you're a nice girl. I like you. But I can read signs if the print is large enough. It was your manner more than the wedding ring that bothered the inspector.  A sort of tenseness, as if you were afraid of something.
I'm trying very hard to be polite about it.
It might be worth a Martini to you.
I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
I'd rather wait until it does matter.
Dance? Tonight?
Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.
Certainly not to me.
At this time of night. It's not as bad as it looks.
Why not?
I didn't notice him.
No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
I don't think that's on the market anymore.  I'd like something much closer to the water.
There would be a moon tonight.
That, and the fun of it.
Including Killaine.
Larry Mitchell found out.  So you killed him.
What your father did doesn't condemn you.
The money that makes you Mr. Clark Brandon.  Let's you live in a penthouse, on top of the Vancouver Royal.  Lets you own a cruiser. Lets you do as you please, go where you please.  You big, open-handed, generous guy.  That's the kind of money it takes, isn't it?
So that I will never be found.
Who'd believe it but you?  I took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  Even if they find him, what connects him with me?
If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself?  Oh, I don't mean with the gun. This is no trick.  When I wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either.  It's not so hard for me as you think. I'm not crying about it, I've been skating close to it for quite some time.  The water is cold down there--  But so is everything else.  And there's you.
If I did-I don't-now.
Who hasn't--one way or another?
We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons.  Was he very drunk when you last saw him?
Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
I don't want to talk.
What will they do to you?
I hope he can prove it.  Come on. You don't want to get pneumonia.
Morning. Any calls?
And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.
Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon.
Bluff. You've waited too long.
Get it in half an hour.
Why not here?
Who told you my name?
How's life treating you?
Hardly. Who's the girl?
Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.
Yes, I've seen it before.
I don't.
Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?
Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.
Where did it all come from?  Or is that a permissible question?
Oh.  That was just one of those idle questions.  One doesn't expect an answer.
Lay off, can't you?
Mr. Mitchell.
Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
And now that he's safe from all other women, you can go on loving him.
How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
He was very easy to hate. If you'll look in your mirror, when you are in a better temper- you'll know why.
Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.
Let me know when you've identified him
If you're asking my opinion, no. I'd read it to Greer over the phone. Ask him if he had any objections.
How important would it have to be? It's only murder, Inspector.
You get it's brother.
Right.
They tell me he'll be a great loss to the liquor trade. This Mayfield girl...
I've met her.
It's her room. She only got to the Hotel this afternoon,. With him.  I guess he took too much for granted. Here's the gun.
Unless the gun was slanted up.
So?
You win, Inspector.  You win all along the line.  Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake.
Are you always this witty?
She might.
She's the only one who had a dead man in her room.  The only one who won't give an account of herself. The only one who tried to run away. And the only one, so far, I've been told, who went to such lengths to disguise her identity that she even removed the labels from her clothes.  What more do you want?
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
Well, find out.  Who's covering her?
Ye have, have ye?
We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles.  Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.
And in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases, does what she pleases?
But you still think she's innocent.
I do.
Splendid. Now she can return the compliment.
What does it look like?
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
You're kind to be so encouraging.
Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.
Don't be silly.  I'll look out some more Suez material for you. You'll be very welcome.
Well, we were just...
Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation?
A glamorous young lady way above his station...
I'll have some of that.
I'd want to set out events as they happened.  The way I see it is this: the British Empire was an ideal.  It may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century, but it wasn't totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some self-respect, which is what I think the Conservatives were trying to do.  Then there's the essential--
And you'll join me in a sambucca?
I thought it was tremendous.
And you're at this third stage
I called you a taxi.
I might.
The Argies.
Come on.  Hand over.
It's shit.
Get way.  You'll see when I'm ready. First I want you to reflect on my noble behaviour, on how your interests are closest to my heart, how I lay awake at night worrying--
Jeremy, just let me see what you've got.
Will it be fun?
I'm not sure.
Fuck off.
And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
I've known Susan for more than fifteen years.  James, we're old allies.
Hello.
She's not my mother, anyway.  My mother's in Italy.
Oh, I see.
I'm not here.
I'm sorry about Saturday, Dad.  It was just impossible to get away.
The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
I'll ring you in the next couple of days.
They won't let you in without one.
And that's why you never went pro?
Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?
Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  Press play.
She'll be fine, Rosie won't do anything.  At least not as long as I meet him at a certain place and time, about... let's see...  ... six hours from now.
Jesus Christ, Bodhi!
All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
Zero distortion, sir.
A little mushy.
Reagan usually drives.  Stolen switch car, they leave it running at the curb, looks parked from a distance.  When they run, they dump the vehicle and vanish.  And I mean vanish.
Thanks, buddy.
He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.
Angelo, we gotta talk.
Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  You see?  Summer's almost over.  They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  The next day at the outside latest.  I got a feeling.
Nothing.
Kid, get outta the way!!
I'm serious.
Catch of the day.
Come on.  At least no one's gonna see how bad you are.
Johnny... what's going on?  I don't get it... did I do something?
Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
Carefully, tough guy.  Very carefully.
Six others, U.S. issue jungle boots. They came in from the north, then followed the guerrillas.
No way, old buddy.
You never did know when to quit.
Also heard that you passed on that little job in Libya.
Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time.
That's right, I set you up. You're a veteran at this, Dutch, I had to.
Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.
This isn't your style, Dillon.
Someone else will be going in with you.
Why didn't he try to kill one of us last night?
No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town?
Well... I might be going out to dinner.
You're making the right decision, sir.
What motel you staying at?
Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
You like being a hooker, Vivian?
Tell me about it.  L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been.  I mean, I use condoms.  Always.  And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer.
For the whole night?
I never joke about money.
Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're...
Off the boulevard.
Exactly.
Fair enough.
Occupational hazard?
What are assets?
Assets are anything of value a company owns.  Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole.  By selling them off, I make a profit.
Not... quite.
I'm in town until Saturday.
But you want days too.
All right, two thousand.
Did you buy some clothes?
Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
What id we run into someone I know?
I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
Stuckey!  He wants an "appointment" with me after you leave.  You my pimp now or did he think that up on his own?
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.
Fuck off.
I'll guard them and you with my life.
What happened to him?
Stay with me tonight.  Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.
Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.
We're letting them slide?
The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions.
Sales, really?  That's great. What does she sell?
We'll be there.  Listen, if he's really caving in, we'll go from there down to the office.  I want him to commit his stock to us this morning.
Let him answer.
Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything!  Kit?  Hey, you there?
Why'd he want you?
Three hundred for last night and he gave me extra to buy some clothes.  Now listen, I'm gonna leave an envelope for you at the front desk. Give me two hundred to the scum bucket and the other hundred to that asshole landlord for part of the rent.  Spend it on drugs and I'll pull your hair out.
What do you know?  You look <u>good</u>. All dressed up.  You clean up real nice.  You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do.  Not that you ever did anyway.
It was great.
Dummy.
I don't care about bucks.  I might love this guy.
School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.
Okay.
Will I like it?
You'll like it fine.
Then you would use your--
Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands.
Me?
It's very expensive.
The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.
He is a sailor on the pirate ship "Revenge." Promise to return him to his ship.
I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything.
But what if something happens to you?
What? -- go on --
Gently!!
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
It never happened. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.
Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.
Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
-- I do not accept excuses.  I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
If there are, we'll all be dead.
That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that many.  I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.
But you don't know where he is.
His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering?  Excuse me --
Everybody ... MOVE!!
Has it been fifteen minutes?
We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.
What is it?
Oh. Well, thank you very much. It's very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right.  The Princess Bride, by S. Morgenstern. Chapter One. Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin.
Yeah. It's really good.
The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
No. You could read a little bit more ... if you want. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           17.
-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it
Of course.
Then we will simply alert him.  Beloved, are you certain he still wants you? After all, it was you who did the leaving in the Fire Swamp. Not to mention that pirates are not known to be men of their words.
Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel.
He is, eh? I'll take a look. Bring him in.
If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26.
Whoever he is, he's too late --  -- see?  The Cliffs of Insanity. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19.
Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
Yes.
I will. And I choose --
Congratulations.
"To my honey I'll croon,
"He's gonna croon love's tune,
Yes, sir.  Thank you.
I'm sorry ... I don't like people touching my blue blanket.  It's not important.  It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and ... and ... I find it very comforting.
Mr. Bialystock ...
I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop.  What difference does it make?
Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.
Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire.
What you were saying.  Keep talking.
You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
But what if the play was a hit?
Poppea.  She was his wife.  And she was unfaithful to him.  So he got mad and he jumped on her.  Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug.  Please don't jump on me.
Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
Oh.
Right.
Then stick with Bialystock!
I don't know.  I think so.  I feel very strange.
You found a flop!
Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
Ahhhhhh.  Leo, Leo, Leo.
Good.  I will make the preparations.
It was the same thing in Germany. We looked for years before we found the right Hitler.
You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?
Got dag pa dig.
Hey, Blum, have a cigar.
Good.  Good.  We go Motel.
Here I come, ready or not.
Ta.  Ta.
By the sacred memory...
Of Siegfried...
Wagner...
Wagner...
Nietzche...
Hindenburg...
The Blue Max...
I mean in show business.
Hey, man, I can't do that here, that's what they put me away for.
Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.
She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
How do you know she didn't make a call?
Look, if you won't believe me, go ahead. You can help me make beds if you like.  Come on.
Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you?
Your girl friend stole forty thousand dollars.
I don't care if you do or... I want to see Mary... before she gets in any deeper...
All right.
I'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you, but...
Teddy called.  Me... And my mother called to see if Teddy called. Oh, and your sister called to say she's going to Tucson to do some buying and she'll be gone the whole weekend and...
You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
He said he was dissatisfied... and was going back.
Sorry I got you up, boy. Go back to sleep. Yeah, be glad to.  Said to give you his regards.
Sure...
With you.
What's the matter?
No. I take it you don't either?  How long?
I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
Yes.
Where could he have gone?
Without calling me?
Sam, he called me when he had nothing definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything...
Does that mean we can't...
Of course we will.
How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
What?
And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy! 
You make respectability sound... disrespectful.
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
The bathroom.
Norman Bates.
All right, you get your dresses hanging out and... change those wet shoes, and I'll come for you soon as it's ready...  ...with my trusty umbrella. 
You shouldn't have bothered. I really don't have that much of an appetite.
Uncommon, too.
It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
She sounded strong...
Thank you, Norman.
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
Frankly, yes.
Arbogast.
Arbogast.  And after he left?  No, it's okay, Norman. How's it been going out there?  Well, I think you oughta unload that place and open up closer in to the action, a smaller place, you know... but...
And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
From what?
Did she talk?
You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives.
No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.
Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you.
Dr. Meirschultz, too?
That sounds to me very remarkable.
It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.
Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
It won't do any good. They are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out.
Oh, so you feel that way too . Motions to other room. Stay in there--I'll call you when needed.
Joseph returns from the room where Gisèle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
The blood transfusion continues. Marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so that he can see Nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the dark. Nikolas watches Léone's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. Life slowly seems to return to her, and her breathing becomes more peaceful. She opens her eyes and looks at the people round her, but she is much too enfeebled to speak, and closes her eyes again. Marc keeps a close watch on Nikolas, who grows paler and paler. His eyes swivel slowly from Nikolas to the patient and back to Nikolas again.
The blood transfusion is completed. While Marc himself is looking after the patient, the nurse leads Nikolas into an adjoining room, where she makes him sit down and prepares his bandage. The doctor stands bending over Léone.
But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
Why didn't you eat last night?
You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
Delighted, I'm sure. 
What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
I'd call it stupid at any time.
Well, that's just how stupid I am. When you go riding, it will be with me. And if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement.
Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?
I'd love to, at any time.
They are.  My boy, I think you are right. Everyone is tired out today and now that we have seen my doors open in a new country, I am beginning to realize that I am a little tired myself. You can call that fellow in from the front. I think we'll close for the night.
Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?
Why the goose pimples? If he wasn't social register -- if it was somebody like me, you'd be trying to hang him.
And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 
No, there's another point I want to iron out.
I asked you to keep your trap shut!
About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
I'm going to get even with you, you dirty stiff! I'll do it!
Fine. You're the first reporter in here for two hours. You people seeing the old year out?
Old Howard Winton's cub?
Ain't that something. The mad monk of Manhattan. Here goes nothing.  Listen to the animal cracker roar like a lion.
No. I wanted to do it without saying anything. I think he's worth it.
Come on, old man, that won't do. You know you're innocent until proven guilty.
That's what I said.
Oh, is that what caused it?
Good night, sir.
Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
Otto! You and one of those other fellows! Come help Professor Darcey.
Well, any time I can do anything for you --
What?
I said she isn't here. NOW you go home. Be a nice boy and go home.
They were just bad men, that's all.
Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
You were pretty bad, huh?
What did you expect?
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
'Course it does.
It was softer'n I thought, that was my main impression. You know, if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot.
Most men wouldn't do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- I guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. They're a bunch of monkeys. I like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.
Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's all, I have a natural curiosity, it's only human. You're my friend, aren't you? Don't you like me?  I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact, I love you.
I'm thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh?
But Rose...
I said I wouldn't.
You're my sweetheart.
Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
How did the rabbits kill him?
Buddy, sex don't mean a thing to me. It ain't nothin' but a mosquito bite.  I'll tell you a secret. Girls don't want sex, Buddy, girls want love.
Yeah, he's still up there.
Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
I do wish you'd speak to Brother. It's true he's been looking at those horrible little books again.
Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this.
They're discussing it.
Let me see!
It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.
Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?
Yeah, they're in the snow.
Got another twenty years in it, boy.  By the way, son, do you recall Rose, that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion.
Of course I recall Rose. In fact I've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half.
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
A wonderful woman, boy.
I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.
That's all I want to know.  Lets get out of here before I get the epizootics myself. Thank you, Doctor, for your discourse, it was fascinating, no doubt.
Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.
Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
Of course.
What?
And she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her.
I love Rosebud, I am wild about Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character, that's all. We have growing children in the house.
Who doesn't have such thoughts?  We'd better get going.
Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never eat, darlin', you know that. Not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses. Let's go, Rose, you and Brother, let's hit the road.
Rose, you and Brother wait in the car. I want to speak for a moment Lo Mr. Hillyer.
That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why.
He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.
Is she all right?
I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.
I am not being brutal to her!
Well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, I admit. But she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her.
Honey, please...
Sometimes the negativism and cynicism in you makes me want to vomit.  Your real trouble is that you're anti-intellectual. The irony is women are supposed to be emotional, but I never saw anybody who depended more on emotion and prejudice than you do.
She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go.
I don't give a hoot in hell's hollow what it means to her! She can't stay in this house forever! I fired her, damn it!
That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?
I forgot that Rose will lie like a child. She's no more pregnant than I am, she just doesn't want to go to that farm!
Is anything wrong?
No, sir.
Got yourself up?
I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman.
Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.
Your baby?
She has other things to do, Dave.
I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit?
I'm only trying to help him, Mother.
It is kind of amazing. The dentist says she has perfect teeth, there isn't a cavity in her mouth.
I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.
More history, Rose.
Oh, no, that's the style. It's meant to be clinging.
Doll, you and Waski run on, too.
It'll get better now.
I know it's embarrassing... but who were you exposed to, dear? ROSE Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h, that's kinda hard to say.
What were you gonna say?  Exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?
Incestuous.
You think it's that good?
Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...
Again.
What'd I say?
It's the way you say it, like there's something more too it.
Hands off the suit, monkey-boy. Close your eyes if you're scared.
It's personal.  We'll hook up at Billy-Boy's pad in an hour.  See ya then.
Entertainers don't count.
We're gonna rain on Zimmermann's parade.
Bullshit.
What was I supposed to do?
Hey... HEY!    Cool down, Jumbo!
No.
Go wherever you want.  Live how you want.
You can't be serious.
Whoops... don't mind me.  Go ahead and finish up.
You are such a disappointment, Benny.
"Go, go, go!"  "Slow down."  Make up your mind.
No you're not.
Is there nothing in this world you enjoy more than the sound of your own voice?
Sounds good.
Come again... ?
There's not even enough places to stash it in a car.
The way Zimmermann takes such good care of you and this drug-peddling "escort service" of yours, I figure you got the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight.
Well, let me tell you how it is...
We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.  Told you they'd do it!
I can't do it, Ben.
But I had to help my friends.
Who are you?
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
Hi, Han... Chewie.
Yeah, she's comin' up.
Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.
Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.
Charges!  Come on, come on!
He wasn't. I can feel it.
You love him, don't you?
On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?
Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
Just...images, really. Feelings.
If that is your destiny.
It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.
Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for...
Certainly not!
Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
On my mother's grave.
And now he works for your Government, doesn't he, Brad?  He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U.F.O's.  Isn't he, Brad?
You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
I've got something to say.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.
I hope so my darling.
You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never
Well, I'm sure you're not spent yet.
Makes you cry
So come up to the Lab.
Want to come again and stay
No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.
Oh.
Creature of the night.
...Fine.
Shell-shocked!
Why?
Do me another favor?
Ya puttin' me on, right?
I'll be waiting.
It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before --
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
Get outta my life both of ya's.
What?!
...I don't feel heat from the name.
One more round.
Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight.
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
She ain't retarded, she's shy.
How 'bout some Cokes?
Not yellow, cautious.  See, it's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt --
Bob.
You have my food in ya hand.
You think I don't hear things?
Paulie's sister.
I feel bad about walkin'.
Rocky.
I'm sure you are.
Stuff it, man!
C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
What?
Come July, twenty-five.
You think everybody I fight is a bum.
Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
Please, kid.
See what?
The owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago.
I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
Maybe ya should see a doctor.
I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
C'mon, ya screwin' her?
Whatta these guys want?
Christ, I been beggin' ya for a break until I'm sick inside.
Feel? I dunno... Happy.
My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.
Sounds like you ve never seen her, Eddie.
I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.
Maroon, right?
Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
The other people who were in here lookin' for the will.  I woulda caught 'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted me.
Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to give you a gold watch.
Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.
Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.
Toons aren't given imperfections.
Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.
You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.
You tricked me, damn you!
Divorce?  Never!
I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
Well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  Only when it was funny.
Your wife may be a lot of things, pal, but innocent isn't one of them.
Because he's not forty feet tall.  The safe was up on the ceiling, remember?
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
Drink it, jerk.  All of it.
Get away from there.
I guess I am at that.  Cigar?
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
Romeo will answer it?
Why, what is Tybalt?
Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze. I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
No, cuz, I rather weep.
Good heart, at what?
A right fair mark, fair cuz, is soonest hit.
'Tis he.
Uncle, 'tis a shame.
My poverty, but not my will consents.
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter now. We must entreat the time alone.
Hold Daughter!
Benedicite! What early tounge so sweet saludeth me?
Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set, on the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, we made exchange of vow. I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, that thou consent to marry us today.
I pray thee, chde me not; whom I love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow; the other did not so.
Affliction is enamoured of thy parts, and thou art wedded to calamity. Hence from Verona art thou banished. Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
Welcome.
[Within] Juliet!
And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.
If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!
Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
If love be rough with you, be rough with love; Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
That dreamers often lie.
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
A Plague o' both your houses.
I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing.
Which leads us to...
Not to me, you know that.
That's him.
Shut up!!!  Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say, is that understood?!?
The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
Duty calls?
Exactly.  Gregor, he was the Russian's man.  It was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the Russians who had the capital to finance it.  Gregor, he was their insurance, and I was ours. Everybody else was supposed to be neutral.  Gregor must've got to Swede...
I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
Not so fast.  Who's that?
He's company.
He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now!
What's that?
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
You'll die if you leave here.
I don't have it with me...
Sent it where?
Nobody's going to do that!
Not exactly.
How did you know?
If he hadn't you'd have put a bullet in his head a long time ago.
Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we see what we can do for you?
But first you have something to take care of?
Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes.
Is that right?
It's been known to happen.
Why don't you go do better, then...
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
Who you calling dumb, dickless?
What's the difference?
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
I do.
There is that.
Like Larry or Swede.
See what?
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth.  I'm a hood, a thief.  Big time in a small time king of way.  To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun.
It's Paris.  The route's too indirect for anything else.  A guy like Gregor, he doesn't waste time on this road unless he has to be on it in the first place. Otherwise, he'd be out of the country by now.  He's going to Paris.  Now I just hope we can find him before he gets there.
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
My job, Vincent, a job you don't need to know about.  I can't go to the local cops -- they'd never be able to get close enough at this point.  It's me or nobody, and I've been on this job too goddamned long not to finish.
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
Yes I do.
The address of the Russian production company.  Just in case we need to find them.
Dark ops?
It is at that.
You don't know?  Bullshit, you had her, there was no way out.
What of it?
I know.
You sure?
I'm sure.
You put everything on the line because you...
Doing well.  This is?
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
All depends on whether you want the Russian or the Gaelic language version.
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
Looks like some kind of drug deal or something, they're not from around here --  one of them's still alive.
Never heard of it.
We don't know that.
I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
I don't know.
Well, we won't do any of that shit!
This isn't a joke. What are we going to do!
I can't do that.
I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch!  Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.
Not bad enough to kill him.
Dwayne had the opportunity, just like us.  He was at the scene.  He grabbed the cash.  Of course.  This is perfect!
Just take it in stride.
You mean that guy was an agent?
Oh.  You coming by tonight?
Nothing happened?
And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.
There isn't gonna be a next time. We're gonna get out of here.
Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.
I swear to you, it's true...
Thanks for your time.
What?
This just might be our ticket!
We appreciate that.
Mm-hmm...
Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?!
Hi.
We are having a sale on some items over here --
I mean at least pick a more discreet place, the scalp, under the armpit, under the tongue, someplace where the trained eye won’t immediately look.
No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and I’m a busy man.
Why?
I don't know...
Forget it.
Save me the sermon.  I've heard it all before, it's boring.
Just do it!  Meet me there, now.
Well you're not getting, either.
I was on a roll!  I’m a little overextended now.
Oh Jesus Christ...
So I want the money and I want it now.
Hi.
I tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent.
You've done without it long enough, ma.
Absolutely positively.
So...what's the good news?
Sir, I'm working on a big case over here -- and by the time I get back they're gonna make you Governor.  Captain, you there?  Hello?  Shit!
Those are five hundred dollar chips.
What??  Where'd you hear that?
Yeah.  We already been there.  This is big, Kenny.  Benjamins.  Secret Service calls 'em superbills.  Banks can't even tell the difference.
I don't think so.
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
It's much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.  The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.
C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won, now just put the gun down.
That's right.
You bring American money?
Detective Carter, you always seem to show up where you don't belong.
No.
You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner last night.
You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home.
Hey!  You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line.
This is a very dangerous man.
Detective Yu?  Never met him.
Who?
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
How the hell did Tan get away with it?
You said --
Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.
Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
It's a long story.
Excuse me?
What is it?
Get it out of here!
Fine.
What's a Chinese heaven?
There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
Yes he did.  He also invented the bicycle.
Don't you talk about my mama.  That's more like it.
Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?
Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
No problem.
Yes.
I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
Amen to that, brother.
Fine with me.
If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.
How do I know I can trust you?
Any leads?
It's my responsibility.
You must come with me for questioning.
Don't.
Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong.
Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.
Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?
Carter.
I'm gonna arrest the sonuvabitch!  Your ass is goin' to jail!
Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.
Beach Boy America.  Help me Rhonda, help me get her out of my --
A little.
Let me just clarify a few things.  I don't care what kind of cop you are in China, you have no jurisdiction in America.  Without me you are just another tourist.
The license!  You get it?!
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.
Yes, I know this song.
I got to stop that dancing in the street Œtill all hours.
Nobody in America eats fish in the AM. We're talking strictly an after twelve noon food type.
It's him.
No, like a tourist.  You know, things to see, money to burn, interested in stupid shit.
Hey, I was senior. It's OK. This is why I get the big bucks.
With the FBI. What do you think I'm talking about?
At this point we don't have much.
Don't worry about the kidnapping, Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that. Your assignment is Lee.
Carter, shut up!
Don't play bullshit games with me.
Or somethin'.
Nobody touches me.
You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.
Ambassador Han.
I want to speak with my daughter!
Yes.
He is very good.
I still have work to do here.
I've got news for you.  No amount of sugar and water is going to turn like Graham into something you want to take on a picnic.
Let me take you back inside, okay?
What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
What did he ask?
And what did you say?
God bless you, Maggie.
Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
We'll rub.
He's here!... He's here!
Don't be nervous, Maggie.  Let us visualize.  Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball."
Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. Cory does that to me when I hyperventilate.
See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
I'm sorry, Ike.  This is permanent.
Where do you think she's going?
Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys, But..."  Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison.
This is good.  It is a good story, Fish.
Okay, you were right.  I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.
Then you'll be my best man.
Oh, I will.
No, I'm not.
That must have made you proud.
-- The luau for Maggie.
You're going to be very disappointed.
He is not!
I'm not a boastful man.  What's your point?
You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
Seven-fifty.
What an incredible chauvinistic observation.
Now that's romantic.  A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?
Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
Yeah.  It's kind of nice.
Yes, I did.
Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
Where?
He looks better with that stuff out of his hair.  He's an attractive man.
Why?
It's for the bell.
No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
No, I'm just going to head home.
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
Boats.  All anyone talks about is the wind.  Is it up, is it down.  I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
What is it?
It's just like my grandmother's china.
Walter, there's something I have to tell you --
Actually, he sounded nice.
They knew it.  Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew.  It was right.  It was real.  It was...
I know that.  You think I don't know that? "I know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way I can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when I heard the two of you on the radio.  On the other hand, maybe I'm just losing my mind."
I should say something in this about magic.
Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
Well, it's the same woman.  And he was crazy about her.  What is this?  This is from Seattle.
So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
I don't even know him.  But I'm having all these fantasies about a man I've never met, who lives in Seattle.
Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.
I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
Hello.
It's me?
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
It's hard to imagine.
You want me to talk to him?
Fair enough.
How about rapacious and love- starved?
No.
Well, okay.  What's the big deal?  If she'll forget the new fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the right direction.
You have to go to her, Jonah. You have to find her.
Do you want a fruit plate?
It's never happening again. Right?
My feelings exactly.
It plays in 50 states.
What?
Jed's got cables.
It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
I know.
How do you know?
I'm starting to forget her.
The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
Now I'm late.  Bye.
It's a sign.
Okay.
It's a short word.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
Get out.
We ought to start camping again, Dad.
It'll take him a while to come around.  A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --
"An Affair To Remember." Did you ever see it? Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr.  Before that it was called "Love Affair With Irene Dunne And Charles Boyer."
You did?
No, no, it's the president of the company himself -- come all the way out here to make Jenkins general manager. So why you acting so mean?
Yeah.
No. No. I can't. If Ramón ever found me on a picket line ...
What's more important than sanitation?
Have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
You are no good to me -- in jail.
But the motion passed. It's ... it's not democratic of you to ...
Backward.
It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.
Shut up, you're talking crazy.
Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.
Okay, so discrimination hurts the Anglo too, but it hurts me more. And I've had enough of it!
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
It's Mama's Saint's Day.
She's coming. Charley Vidal gave her a lift.
You should have helped her without being asked.
Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.
Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
I was talking to my wife.
No, Why?
Get used to it.  You're in a very tenuous position on the food chain, hoss.
I'll see you tonight.
Come on, cheer up. It could be worse.
Ouch.
Go ahead.
I can't.
Why not?
Fuck you.
Because he'll kill me.
It gets me through the day.
Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
What is wrong with you?
How much time do you have?
You don't like the tune, find another station.
Look, maybe you oughta' leave.
Why?
What?
I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.
You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.
Maybe I am dealing with it.
It's not too late to show her you're sorry.
You on a roll?
I'm serious, dude.  You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'.
I guess there's just no substitute for good genes.
Yeah, that's what I mean.  Where the hell does this guy live anyway?
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
Yes, Jimmy
Good for you Jimmy.
You're a good man. Jimmy the Finn.
Why do you say that?
Uh-uh-uh ...
I'll keep that in mind.
You go, boy.
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
Don't you wonder why I do it?
This chink have a name?
He's the only one I told.
What'd you do, piss your pants?
Several possession charges, but nothing major.
You mean the menacing red car?
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
There's no motels around here.
You mean like the Donner Party?
Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.
No, you can't taste it.  It's the fucking lab! Now shut up.
...alright, let me know when.
Thank you, sir.
Not where I come from.
Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain has a mother.
Cap'n...?
I guess.
Wade?
Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.
It's worth it.
To each, his own.
A half-track, anything.
You think the rest of us were?
Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.
The Germans do.
There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.
Yep, hell of a mission.
They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
Three for three.
Yeah.
That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's Ryan?  If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose?  Look at my hand, there it goes again.
Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
Trust me, you're the best.
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
Is silent.  Motionless.  He gently closes Wade's eyes.  His hand quivers slightly as he unclips one of Wades dogtags.  He fumbles and drops it. Sarge notices.
Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.
Yes, sir.
Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
So you refuse to answer my questions?
Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr Sims.  I hope you write that down in your report, I'd like your bosses to read it.
Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
I'm sorry. Sam had to do a new crown, we had [?], and Jason had a sore throat.  Your big graduation, and no one was there.
I hope you understand.
Yes I did- I sat across from her in a mall.  We ate together.  We ate, that's eating, sharing an important physical event.
I'm gonna call her.
Okay, I got it.
I already did.
The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.
You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk.
If you were Diane Court, would you honestly fall for Lloyd?
Alright.
I'm going to take out Diane Court again.
I won?
Okay, I give up.
I know that.
Dad, no.  But I didn't want any problems, so I decided not to sleep with him.
Dad, did you do it?  Did you take that money?
Swear to god.
You think you know what this money is?
You let me believe you.  You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it.  God, how... how could you...
Why are you being so hateful to me?  Is this because of Lloyd?
Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest.  I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.
What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
Pardon me?
Would you hold this for me?
Oh.  Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.
Yeah.
Bye.
Yeah.  I'm so glad we did this.
So what's your job this summer?
Sixteen weeks is a long time.
You think so?
What did you say?
I just can't have any social life right now.
Be friends?
Yeah.
Now, go into second.  Little more gas... Yeah!  You can get  this whole problem.  Now, maybe you downshift to first?
You're cold.
Here are some blankets.  This is a good song, this is a really good song.
Why didn't you tell me?
No, no.
It sounded like you did.
No.  We decided that we're friends.  I mean, I know it's a terrible word...
No I didn't.
What, I'm sorry I said that.  Forget I said it, it's what I thought I meant, but forget it.
Oh shit.
Man, you're bringing me down!
Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
No, really.
Are you?
I know.
You're not a permanent part of her life.  You're a distraction.
So what's up?
I don't know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.
Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
I love you man.
How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?
What -
You would, though.  That's what I'm saying.
He's important to my business.
When?
Nice things cost money.
Pistols, rifles, carbines ...  I'd be grateful.
Whoever.  They're the ones.  They'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me.
The contracts?  That's the easy part. Finding the money to buy the company, that's hard.
There's nothing you can do.  I'm not asking you to do anything.  You came into my office.
Well, I'll talk to somebody.  I'll take care of it.
Give or take what, Stern - how many - count them.
Stern.
There will be generations because of what you did.
He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.
No, we got pressure from California State. The man practically has clemency. We can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. He has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move.
Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
They've broken their pattern.
I won't.
Where?
Stop it...
I'm losing you.
That's okay.
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
I'm inquisitive.
What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
And much richer as a result.
Do I know you? You look familiar.
Finish what my son started.
That’s quick.
Good question. You took the bait.
I didn't say she was alone. That guy-- from her home town showed up. They went off together.
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
Just for you, Sid.
Tails.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?
No, I'm the one who's sorry. I misjudged you. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some oozing to do.
Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.
They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.
Yeah, right.
Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.
Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.
It's good to see you involved.
Are you in danger now?
But I love you. And I want the whole world to know it.
Nah...I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes.
It's not a good idea, Hallie.
Thanks, Joel.
Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
I just love being a sister.
She's not here right now.
But...
Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.
Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either but I'm really concerned about my safety now.
I don't know.
Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?
Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something?
I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.
No.
What?
Mm, what a waste of Silicone.  What does my mother have to do with this all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro.
Do you really mean it this time Gale?
When we did the first 'Stab" I realized I'd known Maureen Prescott before, I mean as Rina. I couldn't tell anyone.  Can you imagine the press?
Need to get in that building?
Settle down Beavis.  Why don't you tell us the truth?
Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
They're the ones who approved it.
Just because you knew her?
Really, cause that stunt lost me the lead role in Roman Polanski's latest picture. Huh, what a coincide I was picked up by Roman Bridger. Well, not exactly the Roman I wanted. Get my point? STAB 3 is bullshit. Fuck, because of your big mouth I'm here, drinking piss water SCOTCH with Second rate fucking celebrities like Jennifer Jollie and yourself!  Hey, I just got an idea. Maybe I should Have a look at your break line. That your car over there?
I know! He killed Kincaid!
This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number.
But you know my favorite name?
Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
My movie.
Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
The final act? Well let's play asshole!
Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?  Are you listening to me, huh?
I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
Where the fuck did she go?
I can't... I'm bad off, Billy. You cut too deep.
What are you doing here?
And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you.
Hey, hey, it's just me.
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
You have to move on, Sid.
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
Are you serious?
Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
No, but if it were you, that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track. Using your one phone call to call me so I wouldn't think it was you.
Got the ending figured out yet? Time's running out.
To apologize.
I want to talk to you for a second.
Who is this?
Do you like scary movies?
Uh-huh.
Don't...
Dial someone else, okay?
Guess.
No...
NOOO!
No... please.
It's an easy category. Movie trivia.
Don't do this. I can't...
Please..stop...
Then you should know Jason's MOTHER -- Mrs. Vorhees was the original killer. Jason didn't show up until the sequel.
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
We haven't ruled out that possibil...
That's quite alright. If I may say so, ma'am, you're much prettier in person.
I don't think you're so bad.
...yeah...
I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
She's tough.
Have to be. The shit she's gone through.
What about the cellular phone bill?
Yes, sir, sheriff.
The phone's dead.
Forget it.
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
So who are you?
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
...so call if you need me.
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
Don't come any closer.
Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out. Takes a man to do something like that.
You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
So while they're off investigating a dead end, Billy, who's been written off as a suspect, is busy planning his next hunting expedition.
There goes my chance with Sid.
Yeah.
The official term is "psychotic".
Peer pressure... I'm way to sensitive.
And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end.
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
Later.
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
Whatever. Just hurry.
I knew this guy was too perfect. He was destined to have a flaw.
I don't know...
That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.
So far it's all dead ends.  No credit history.  No employment history.  His bank account's only five years old and it started as cash.  We're even trying to trace his furniture, but for now all we know is he's independently wealth, well educated and totally insane.  We may never know how he got that way.
Announcing what?
This can't be my last duty here.  It will go on and on.
No, I haven't heard.
Good.
Really?
It would be too hard.
I read about it in the paper.
It's not too far away now.
What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done.  Wouldn't want to miss it.
Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny.  I like you.  I like you a lot.
A woman... so ugly on the inside that she couldn't bare to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside.  A drug dealer... a drug dealing pederast, actually.  And, don't forget the disease spreading whore.  Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face.  That's the point.  You see a deadly sin on almost every street corner, and in every home, literally.  And we tolerate it. Because it's common, it seems trivial, and we tolerate, all day long, morning, noon and night.  Not anymore.  I'm setting the example, and it's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed, from now on.
Delusions of grandeur.
Actually, if it's all the same, I'd like to get to the precinct house a.s.a.p.  Seeing how we don't have much time for this whole transition thing.
All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
Not here.
Is there any blood in it?
I read.  Remember reading?
Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.
Just wait!
I wish I still thought like you.
We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom.  It's like collecting diamonds on a desert island.  You keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.
Bullshit.
Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
What does all that matter anyway?  It's not our job to figure him out, is it?  All we have to do is catching him.
This is stupid.  It'd be just too easy.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.
What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?
Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right?  No one's worthy of you.
Kiss me on the lips.
Wait!
What did you say?
Any person who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me... disagreeable. Just ask your husband.
Did the wife confess?
But Mose Harper said...
Huh...? No...no water.
It was, I tell you!
Now, now...let's not grow dis- putatious...
He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.
There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?  Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...
Sonny, yonder's a passel of murderers, complete with Texican scalps an' white girl captive...You want to protect us, you just get out of our way...Now <U>skedaddle</U>!
Told ya, didn't I?
You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.
You got it with you?
Easy!  It's forty miles, sonny...Horses can do with some grain and a little rest.
If they're still alive...
Maybe I'm gettin' like Mose Harper -- my bones is cold tonight...
What's the sense in it!
Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
No...not yet...
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...
It still worked in town.
I'll do it myself.
And two months later, we got married.  And all because of one sentence:  "With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
Come on, this isn't about honesty. You just need a good night's sleep. The way you toss and turn all night, even I hardly get any sleep.
No, thanks.  I have everything I need.  Drive safely, you hear?
In the village.  Look what I found.
I haven't the slightest idea.
Look at this!  The dog!  She's dead!
Hi, darling.
'HE'?  Whom do you mean-
And the title of this piece?
It's good.
And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.
Really?
I had the Christopher Marlowe in my boat once.
Sir Robert De Lesseps.
See you in jail.
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
How much?
You're a liar.
Tell me, are you lately humbled in the act of love?
By heaven, I thank you! I will be your Apothecary!
Partners!
Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business.  The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.
Very well.
Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my business I would be out of business if I had your courage, so don't tell me about business
What piece? Richard Crookback?
Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona.
I did not.
We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster.
You want to know what parts you are to receive. All will be settled as we go
The one who came with your letter?
God's teeth, am I to suffer this constant stream of interruption?!  What will you do in Act Two when he meets the love of his life?
I love your early work. "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?"
I have a new one nearly done, and better. The Massacre at Paris.
Ethel.
A different one you haven't written?
I am not so well-born.
Stand up straight, girl.
Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts.  How much was the wager?
Fifty shillings.  Pounds.
"Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
"Ay me."
Is she obedient?
So this is the favour you find in the Chamberlain's Men.
Who is there?
Oh, not for the world!
I am.
And that was only my first try.
Well perhaps better than my first. 
Moonlight!
No, the morning rooster woke me.
It was the owl--come to bed
Stage fighting!  Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday.
It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
My lord.
I have spoken with your father.
So my lord? I speak with him every day.
No. I have spoken to the Queen.  Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
Do you intend to marry, my lord?
How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia.
She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
Thomas Kent. I would like to do a speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player.
Wait there.
Let me see you. Take off your hat.
It is only ours you can know.
Your aunt?
Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.
By God, I'll fight the lot of you
I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
Will you shut up and play.
You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
Why, thank you, David.
Alex, I don't have the time --
No.
You think so?
Just stop worrying.
Now.
You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.
I don't know anything about it.
Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, we're short.
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
I don't know them.
That's all?
I see.
Yes, thanks.
And you like it?
Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
So tell me, Cameron, what on earth -- just tell me, because I want to know -- what on earth could make you think that we would want to share a flat like this with someone like you?
-- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs, the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while I, aroused and inflamed --'
I think you're lying.
You're right.
Hugo.
He's got a car?
What sort of car?
What? What's wrong?
It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be rational, please, and failing that be quiet.
I thought we all were.
Stop nagging.
That's not him.
Yes, it is. It's him. Cameron, Cameron, come on over.Yo!
No.
You know we're right.
Oh, good.
Forget it -- he'll come down.
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
Oh, shut up, Alex.
The perfect couple, I should say.
There are only two other people in the flat.
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
Someone lost the key.
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
Two hundred pounds?
No one. I promise.
It was on the television.
Sorry?
Yes, sir.
Here?.
You must be Juliet.
A priest who dies.
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct.
And what do you recognize, names or faces?
I suppose so.
You mean that girl, don't you?
I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.
These attacks... it's got something to do with her... uh... pancreas.
She did?
I've gotta give her some pills. Percodan, she ran out.
I'll be back in a while.
I don't want to talk about it...
You're looking great, baby.
Why don't you see Lester?
Your husband?
Hello, George.
No, baby... I'm glad you're coming tonight.
Nobody can hear it.
Like what?
I don't know, kill herself. She's O.D.'d four times.
No.
What would my being a faggot have to do with that?
Why?
You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
Look...  Do you wanna fuck me?
They are?
I guess not...
It's got nothing to do with inflation. Rates, for example, rise independently of tight money if you look at interest curves carefully. Historically, that's always been true, though most people don't realize it.
Well, I do Barbara Rush.
Look, Mr. Roundy, why don't you make out a financial statement? It'll save us both some time. Miss Michaels here can show you... have it notarized and we'll see where we go from there. Miss Michaels, would you get me a couple of forms?
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
I've got heads here, Norman.
Oh fuck, Norman!
Somebody's going to have to wash Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.
You are today.
I'm sure.
You going to tell him?
You did, I know you did.
I don't want to... I swear...
Fuckin' A --
Why?
-- you've got to leave.
That's it, then I'm leaving.
What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late.
So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me.
She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.
If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!
-- why did you come in today?
Not yet.
Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
What?
You said somebody... who?
George, I don't --
I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm gonna open the shop. I'm getting it together.
I am?
Do you really mean that?
But in the same house, you know, one house.
Okay, baby. Okay...
Great.
Could I?
Great... can we talk later?
Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
I already said hello.
Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
Whether or not I'm going.
They didn't offer you the job yet.
Who?
Wait a minute, God-damn-it. Do you think I want to go to some God damned party? I'm trying to get that God damned shop open. I'm trying to get a little bread together. That's all I'm doing.
I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
Well that's something.
I'm very tired, George.
Yes.
-- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
-- please, baby --
-- tell me something -- did you talk about me?
Yeah, I know. Did you?
Thank you.
I know what you mean.
Your hair looks -- well fabulous.
All night.
Well... who are those guys?
Godammit, George...
That's got nothing to do with it... You're so beyond my comprehension I can't even discuss it with you.
No, not yet, not yet. You worry about it for a while, I've been worrying all night, now you can worry.
We're always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don't like it... that's just how it is... look, it's got nothing to do with you, man. It just happened. Felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to PTA meetings?
Yes I do.
And?
Who do you think I was talking to?
Really? How about starting with tonight?
Oh yeah?
No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
Well, what is it, honey?
I thought you said things were great with George.
We don't think marriage is important.
But you have problems?
What?
-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
What did you do?
Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
Not with your hairdresser.
I don't think so.
George is a hairdresser, isn't he?
Of course not.
You mean when are you going to Egypt?
You're going?
Sure thing, Mr. Karpf. C'mon.
Jill.
Oh, say, how would you kids like to stop off for a drink?
Good.  I want you to have a good time.
You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
No, Dad.
Who's Tony?
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
Is Tony the one that tells you things?
Don't worry, Mom.  I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.
Yeah.
I won't make any noise.
Talking to Tony.
Is Tony one of your animals?
To my stomach.
Did the appearance of Danny's imaginary friend...?
Well how can I repay you?
Great.  Sit down.  Oh these marvellous doughnuts, help yourself. Coffee will be ready in a few minutes.
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
And, er... where are they now?
This is Dick Halloran, our Head Chef.
Well I guess I probably heard you call him that.
I'm a writer um... Teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet.
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.
That's swell.  I like you, Lloyd. I always liked you.  You were always the best of them. 
When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
I'm not going to hurt you.
Put the bat down, Wendy.
Give me the bat.
Well, that's very good time, very good.  Please sit down a minute.
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
Well, my predecessor in this job
Oh...
Blue. This blue.
Rats...
Piss on him. Piss on all the Red Sox.
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
Yeah... sure.
Was it a prescription?
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
I will- be good, kids.
I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.
Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can tell.
I said I was a nun, not an asshole.
LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
HE'S SO FINE...
Well... because it's in the Bible. "Thou shalt not..."  Thou shalt not.
That... thing.  That nun thing.  Take it off.
How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank?
He said that if I got a divorce I'd burn in Hell.  For all eternity.
You bastard!
That used to be true, Vince.  I was with you.  But something happened.  And I'm different now.  Real--different.  I've had, well, you might call it -- a religious experience.  And I've got just two words for you.  And those two words are...
Yes, Betty?
D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.
The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
It's after five.  We have to bathe.
I... I brought you something.
She said that?  Reverend Mother?
Now you.
This is your neighborhood.  Your turf. You should get to know 'em.
Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.
Experience!
HONOR THY MOTHER AND THY FATHER TOO DON'T KILL, DON'T STEAL, IT'S BAD FOR YOU
I was expelled!  When I was fifteen?
What?
A what?
Silence?  No talking?  All day?
No food.  Not until sundown.
How to put it... ah, Of course, Mary Clarence.  "No pain, no gain."
I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for it to happen!  And I was the one they were shooting at!
Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
And what next?  Popcorn?  Curtain calls? This is not a theater.  or a casino.
Exactly.  People like going to theaters and casinos.  But they think church is for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack the joint.
What?
I am sorry, Mary Clarence.  I seem to have misplaced my tambourine.  Good day, Mary Clarence.
I'm a Christian.
Yeah, like what?  Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out?  Lottery tickets?  A travel iron?
'Cause you're always out, arresting people.  Making trouble.  I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard!
Oh, yeah? Well, how do you think I felt? You were singing in bowling alleys back then.  I told people you were a hooker!
Then-you run.
Maybe Hawaii.
You son-of-a-bitch!
Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
Oh-huh.
You were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot.
So, take it off.
Which one!
That's what I figured, too.
We're losing it.
Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
Impossible.
And you'll face that danger head-on.  As if I could stop you.  And you have my complete support in this matter. Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.
It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right?
Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
You will stay at her side?
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
Excellent.  Then, you are excused till morning.
And now Jonathan Masbath.
Up.
Should we go back?
To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place.
And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
In test... what?
Baltus Van Tassel.
There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  "Paasch, James" "Pieter, Thomas" "Pos, William."
Don't you see why?  Look closely a moment.  Put your intellect aside.  Can't you see what is inexplicable?
I insist that you have it.
The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.
What troubles you?
What has happened?
A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
Just... keep where you are.
And, what did he say?
Where?
I didn't see none.
The Horseman.  Yes.
No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?
French-fried potaters.
Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
Yeah.
He had of went nuts and did somethin'. They don't put you in there for just bein' a retard. They's retards all over the place that ain't in the nuthouse. Do you know, Frank?
This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.
Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?
You be quiet, Frank, we're talkin'. The adults are talkin'. Were you in the lockup for cuttin' somebody up with a hatchet?
Don't talk about daddy. Y'all go on to the garage and let me be.
I hate you!
I never was much count at it. I never did get picked out fer it.
Did you want to play ball with us?
I don't want to worry your mama with company.
I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em.  When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now.  Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then.
Why did he do that, reckon.
I like the way you talk.
I was goin' to the secret place. I borried one of your books to take down there. You ain't mad, are you?
I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
I ain't got no money to get 'em with but I bet Vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store.
And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all.
I reckon.
Readin' on this book on how to work carpentry. I aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times. I've always been partial to wood buildin's and cabinets and whatnot. These drawin's they got here don't make no sense to me so far.  You seem like yore tails a'draggin' a might. You got somethin' wrong with ye?
No sir.
Yes ma'am. I like a fried chicken leg.
Just diggin'.  I ain't ever gonna be happy now. Not with that son of a bitch movin' in for good. I wish me and you and Mama could just run away. But she said he would find us wherever we went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think it would of been better if I wadn't ever born.
I care for you, too. But you'll be around, don't say that.
I aim fer you to have 'em.
I've got a feelin' today.
Don't go home tonight and stay with that Doyle. He's got it in for ye tonight. I got me a feelin', too. Feels like to me you ort not be there in that house with him liquored up and mean. Ye mama neither. When you get up from here, I want you to go to that feller's house. Your mama's friend. I want you to give me your word on it.
Nice to meet you, Karl.
Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all. There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop.  He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
They ain't even no good. The only one can play is Randy Horsefeathers. He claims he's an Indian. His real name's Randy Collins and he works at the feed mill. He can at least play guitar.
I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.
Yes, I guess you are.
I'll be.
Right now?
Okay.
What brings you back?
Naw, I ain't.
How long have you been standing here?
Quite a spell, I reckon.
I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow.
Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and get you at noon.
That's what I thought. I hope I haven't offended you in any way. You seem like a thinker. You seem to always be in deep thought. Tell me something. What are you thinking right now?
Naw, not yet.  I want ye to give this to Mizz Wheatley. Hit ain't much, but maybe there's a little somethin' to hep out. Hits what I've earned fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot fer Bill Cox.
I don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy.  You've been real square dealin' with me. The Bible says two men ort not lay together. But I'll bet you the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.  That boy lives inside of his own heart. Hits an awful big place. You take care of that boy.
He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him.
Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper. But it has pictures. I mean it's a regular paper, you know.
Melvin, go get Karl and take him down to the old classroom.
I don't think so. Just period, I think. She told him... God gave them the ugliest creation he could think of. Karl has an entire book -- a notebook. On every page it says "Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number 1." He wrote that a few years ago after he'd learned to write. His father's name was Franklin.
Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.
I think everybody at the store knows that already. They always talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more.
An invitation?
It's my birthday.
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
I'd love to.
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
A photographer ...
Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.
What do you mean?
Fuck you, kid.
For once in my life I managed to keep my mouth shut. There's something to be said for that, I suppose.
Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down.  Somebody's worried about my health.
That's a feather in your cap, man. The paper of record.
She probably died.
Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.
Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now.  Was that your idea to call her Felicity?
It means "happiness."
You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
Fifteen years ago?  It won't wash, pumpkin. No mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he's a father. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.
I thought I could handle it. I didn't want to bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own, but I couldn't. She's in real bad, Auggie.
You what?
Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves.
When I told her I was going to bring her father, she kind of melted. It's the first time Felicity's talked nice to me since she left home. She's dying to meet you, Auggie.
Still, you can't just write her off.
I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
Five thousand bucks.
How long you been working for me, Auggie?
Shit. You should have been married to someone by now. You know, settled down somewhere with a kid or two, a nice steady job.
I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.
This way, gentlemen. Let's retire to my office, shall we?
No, it's five thousand dollars.
Your job? You've got five thousand bucks. What do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for?
And these?
Forty-four. They're on special this week from the Canary Islands. A real bargain.
I think I'll take them. 
I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.
Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister.
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?
He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.
Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water?
Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected?
And?
Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning.
It'll cost you five bucks.
Once you look at it, you're going to want to buy it from me. That's guaranteed. And that's the price: five bucks. So if you're not willing to spring for it, you might as well not bother to look. It'll just tear you up inside and make you miserable.
I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.
Hi there, little brother.
Are you making fun of me? I won't be mocked. Do you hear me? I won't let no punk kid stand there and mock me!
Baby? And what baby is that?
What are you talking about?
Management. Those guys are walking around with their heads up their asses.
I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that?
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
That's okay. I've already had lunch.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
Of course. Where else?
Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
I used to have one, but it broke a couple of years ago and I never got around to replacing it.  I'd just as soon not have one anyway. I hate those damn things.
Nice drawing. Did you do that?
No, he was a schoolteacher. But he liked to dabble.
You'll find juice and eggs and milk in the refrigerator. Cereal in the cupboard. Coffee on the stove. Take whatever you want. But it's time for me to get started in here.
It just won't do, will it? I go two and a half years without being able to write a word, and then, when I finally get started on something, when it looks as though I might actually be coming to life again, you show up and start breaking everything in my house. It just won't do, will it?
Take good care of yourself, okay?
I don't know. For helping me out.
Okay, okay.  It's all so stupid.  There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that's what people call him. The kind of guy you don't want to cross paths with.
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.
Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.
So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
That's it. In a nutshell.
It wasn't my fault.
It's all right. I really do know them.
Keep it tonight.  We'll catch fish. I'll see ya back on the docks...
No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
And the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant.  Seeing that his type is O negative.
That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.
Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.
So you hid the truth.  Deliberately.
I don't mean everyone.  Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them.  Or run a newspaper.
Look, I <u>want</u> to forget you, I do. I think if you hold me, just this once, I can walk away and never speak to you again.
More than eager.  He was out to make a point.
Pretty darn clear.
But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
That's curious.  I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.
Oh, yeh.  He said someday he would get his land back.
Oh, yeh.  But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell.
Carl Heine came.
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
No, you don't.
Naw, I had that around for a while.
Look, no way I'm lettin' you out there.  In a half hour you could be in Canada.
I think you like learning.
Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.
Apparently.
Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.
You don't.  <u>Remember</u>.
Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
You can speak for what he <u>said</u>. Just like you did for Mr. Hooks...
As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.
Listen, doll - what time do you get off tonight?
Never mind leaving your door open - I got a passkey.
Funny?  In what way?
Yeah.  Why?
Dentist?  We been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?
But suppose he loses?
With you.
I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive.  There'll be no buzzing around tonight.
But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency?
Good night, Josephine.
And I'm not even pretty.
I'm tired of being a flag.  I want to be a bull again.  Lets get out of here, Joe. Let's blow.
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
Yes, Mr. Fielding - you'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat - goodbye - what's that you said?  Oh - zowie! I'll give her the message. 
Fat chance!  You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.
He's going to be ashore with you.
You can both go take a flying jump.
I am.
Jerry!  You can't be serious!
But you're not a girl.  You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?
I'll say there is!
Oh, I don't expect it to last.  I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.
Oh.
Jerry, listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it's just not being done!
I'm a boy - I'm a boy - I wish I were dead - I'm a boy - I'm a boy -  What am I going to do about my engagement present?
Daphne got a proposal tonight.
Shut up and keep packing.
Terribly sorry.
That's all right.  I was afraid it was Sweet Sue. You won't tell anybody, will you?
Good night, honey.
If there's anything I can do for you -
Anything wrong?
I know where to get some.  Don't move.
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
No fair guessing.
I'm just going to get some ice.
Come on, Daphne.
I met one of them.
What's the big idea?
You're the wrong shape.  Goodbye.
Most of the time I slap it.
Why?
Well, then, why don't we go dancing? I know a little road-house, down the coast -
You know something, Mr. Fielding? You're dynamite!
You're leading again.
Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.
Oh, that's all taken care of.  I'm giving them shore leave.  We'll have a little cold pheasant - and champagne - and I checked with the Coast Guard - there'll be a full moon tonight - oh, and tell her I got a new batch of Rudy Vallee records -
Thank you.
You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
What kind of band is this, anyway?
No - funerals.
All right - lets take it from the top. And put a little heat under it, will you?
Brains aren't everything.
Going to catch yourself a rich bird?
I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
Why?
Are you staying at the hotel?
They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.
That's very interesting.
I beg your pardon?
And you will come to hear us tonight?
If it's at all possible -
I am?
I wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of Long Island is fogged in.
It's the thought that counts.
It's not how long it takes - it's who's taking you.
Just regulation size.  We have three like this.
Three?
Well, that depends - on whether you're coming or going - I mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern - and that's the bridge - so you can get from one side of the boat to the other - how about a glass of champagne?
What is it?
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
I'll say.  I had two ponies drowned under me.
Where's your shell collection?
Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
Why?
Thanks just the same.
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
I'm going to see him again tonight - and every night - I think he's going to propose to me - as soon as he gets up his nerve.
Yes.  Now about our date for tonight...
Quite a while.  As a matter of fact, I'm not coming back at all.
It's all rather complicated - what we call high finance - but it so happens that the president of the Venezuelan syndicate has a daughter, and -
Real diamonds.  They must be worth their weight in gold.  Are you always this generous?
Say, Maestro - where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?
Why?
Well, we all got to go sometime.
Are you sure you’re okay?
What?
Other than, he’s shagging your exgirlfriend?
Hello, Katmandu.
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
Well, we had a lot of good years, but then...
It’s not supposed to be anything, Kat. It’s just my rather feeble attempt to.... Oh, I don’t know.  You see, I thought I could deny my feelings--
You have feet?
Of course he is. I’m here with my new man.  I love it! Your magic’s already working. Let the suffering begin.
What does your gut say?
That won’t be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  No offense.
A weekend?
That’s right. Imagine facing it alone.
Shampoo, got it!
Yeah. As an adult, I needed to find some way to experience intimacy and sex, but with rules that couldn’t be violated.
Admit it. You were disturbed, but ultimately moved.
When you’re ready to let go, to be unsingle and unmiserable, you will. Until then....
I guess so.
If I was going to charge you, I would have told you beforehand. I thought I explained that.
Make out with you for free.
I get all the glamour jobs.
You pawned it.
Hi, kiddo.
Oh, well, then. It probably won’t work out.
I haven’t thought about that in years.
You don't live around here, do you?
I don't know, he's in a prison camp.
Let me see it...
Sure--
I can't answer that for you -- but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father.  Come on, tell me...
What do that mean?
You would do that, wouldn't you?
Boy, you don't make funny with your daddy like that.
"You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"
Now who says I didn't lay my mark on you, boy!
Hi to you, son...
He'll show up one day.
Will you help me to find out what camp they sent my father to?
Goodnight.
Yes mam...
When you get outta that school, you come right on back home, y'all gon' have to take this laundry work I done for Miss Boatwright today.
So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.
Good night...
Miss Johnson is a teacher, and...
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
Come in, children.
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
They probly thought you was crazy.
Maybe soon--
Why don't you pay him a visit, Mr. Howard? He'll tell you all about it.
To invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree, drink ice cold whiskey, and just shoot the breeze!
Did you tell 'im I was too busy for that kinda stuff?
Yeah, just stay where you is...
To the commissary to get this boy some clothes! I'm gon' get everybody somethin'!
I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.
It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.
I got to see my husband, Sheriff Young!
Behold my glory.
Stan, your friends need you. They are in trouble and you must help them.
Don't worry about that. Now, I want you to say 'Doggy.'
OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN'T FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE--
How would you like to gargle rat jiz?
They're burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war.
We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
Sheet!
Oh.
Yeah!  And what rim job expert went and outlawed Cheesy Poofs!?
Sure, dude.  On the face of every child, on the smile of every baby...
Whoops.
I don't have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores, Kenny!
Yes, hon?
This is it! The time for action is NOW!!  <b>Something must be done! This is like a spreading rash! They're pulling out our children's brains and filling them with trash! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of smut and sex and poo! I believe the good fight has begun! Something must be done!</b>
MPH RM!!!
Mph rm. Rmph rm rmph rm.
Mrph mprph!!
MOM!!!
What's the password?
Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?
Wow!
Oh God... What have I done...
What is Terrance and Phillip?
Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is impeaching you.
My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?
Hello, Brooke Shields!
You would know, dummy.
I know, Terrance.  This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time.
Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of words!
Okay, kid, I have a deal for you! If you want out of hell, all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'Snacky Smores.'  They're rich, chocolatey and really hit the spot. Bring me ten proofs of purchases and we'll grant you ANY WISH YOU WANT.
Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
No I'm being serious! Those Canadian entertainers are to be killed. It is the seventh sign.
Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love.
Don't call me dumb!
Where're you gonna go, bitch? Besides, you know that if you left me, I'd hunt you down and kill you, right? I'm gonna go grab a drink.
No! It can't be!
Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.
Cool!
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for-</b>
Oh yeah...
Oh yeah...
Magnificent, magnificent.
Hello second mate Barnes. I was instructed to come to the bridge.
Oh he did, did he?
Well you did the right thing Mac.
Well, maybe I will.  You sure you don't want anything?
That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.
Like that piece of ass he was with.
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
Well, plus the money ain't that bad. DAWN So, tell me, do you think everyone gets their million dollars' worth on this trip of a lifetime?
I'm sure you'll be all right.
Simulated space walking.
Why?  Where are you going?
So I've been told.
How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?
How am I supposed to know?
Who are you calling a pig, rummy?
What makes you so sure?
Mac.  What's shaking?
Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
Right, I understand that...
One moment please...  one moment please...
Yes.  You can enjoy some wonderful views from there.
No. I'm from Akron.
You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.
Sheila, meet...uh...  I forget the name.
Theo's bowled on the tour.
Miles, I've always been on the square with you.
Need some advice, huh.
100 years! 
Thanks.
I couldn't pay someone enough to try to kill me. Sheila comes over to take their orders.
The small ball.
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.
What's it look like to you?
Did that porcupine say he'd get you back on the tour?
Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.  I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up.
You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.
Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?
Who's there?
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen. 
That's right, didn't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament,champ?  Now go take out your "big four", darling.  Come on, we're making her nervous.
I like the sport the way it is.
Look who's talking!
Bowling "Center"!
Like this?
Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
My mom told me not to stay in this town.
I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.
Why should I help that old fuck.
You got any broken bones?
I can't tell you, Theo.
I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.
You should.
Are you sure he's dead?
I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.
Tell your little pal to let go.
The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality.
I'm the next of kin. I should've seen him.
Yeasts?  Thank you, Beth, but I don't think we're gonna open it up and find a loaf of bread.
Yeah.  I heard you.
There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  Can't you tell us something.
Shut up, Beth.  I don't want to hear it.
What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
He's right beneath us.
Norman, don't do it!
Now!
Captain.
The Pentagon?  I didn't know I had friends in Washington.
What?
What do you need me for?
I'm afraid it is Dr. Johnson... because it's sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor.
We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.
I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
When was this?
... it raises a very serious question: <u>What happens if Jerry</u> <u>gets mad</u>?
Nothing, sir.
They've left, keep watching!
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
What are you going to do -- shoot her?
What is it?
Radiation shield, you think?
I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant.
Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --
Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --
Where did you get this?
You bastard.
Beth, I didn't.  Hold it together. Alright?
I have to reset the sub.
You don't trust me?
But I don't know how --
You fixed this suit?  Beth?
My air isn't... I'm coming back.
Still clear.
It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any.
None of this was here before.
He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.
Beth --
Where are you?
How's Harry?
You think I'd really drink that?
You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
You know what I mean.
Am I afraid of them?  Not during the day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch.  This is quite good.
No, he isn't.
He can't manifest.
Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman.
I never went in that sphere.
You don't remember you did.  But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you?  You remember that.
Top shelf, is it?
Hear what?
Beth --
All that banging and pounding.  I don't know.  We should think about making a good first impression.
For who?  The fish?
Like what?  I'm not --
Won't make any difference.  The tapes document everything.
No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
Don't be defensive.
To what?
Time travel.  A black hole.
Not a clue.
On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "Unknown Entry Event." They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.
You don't understand about the sphere.
What happens on page 87?  Have you ever read page 87?
I could never read that far.  I never wanted to.
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
What do you mean?  She's not here?
I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there.  Take a look for yourself.
Shut up and open the door.
No.  I don't.  But I always said to myself, when I die, I want to die laughing.
To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.
Is it?
Save your breath.  It's not an alien spacecraft.
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Arrived?  From where?
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
What was that, sir?
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
What report?
Know what?
Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.
I don't see anything.
Unless it's an act.
I'm Ben Kenobi.  Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition.
The planet has been totally blown away!  It would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than I've ever seen... If the Empire had a new weapon that could do this... I would have heard something... I'd know about it.
Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move.  We haven't much time.
I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.
Who's going to pay me then?
I'm beginning not to like you.
What do you want with our scan-proof lockers?
There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.
Don't you have a Kiber crystal?
Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.
You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help.  I must try to find the Crystal.
Have you been checked out?
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
Did it occur to you they might find us?
I think I did.
Move out of the way!
I know, but the chances for survival here just aren't great enough in my book.  I've got what I came for. Now I've got to get back to my ship.
We'll send a squad up.
It appears your ship had an accident. I will see to it that your death is duely reported.  There will be no one to save you this time.
There'll be time for that later. Now let's get out of here.
If you're as good a pilot as you are a swordsman... We're the ones who have been rewarded.
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
I can't make it.  You go on, master Luke.  It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account.  I'm done for.
You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?
You rich kids... are all the same !
Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.
He was our teacher... He was great.
Others are waiting.
You got it bad.
If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
Dizzy wouldn't want our tears. She'd want us to remember her... with a vengeance. So go out and kill a bug for Dizzy. Kill as many as you can. You are her revenge, and every bug you kill honors her death.
The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle.
THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now.
Zander, please... Let's go !
You're upset, that's alright.
Your turn...
Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical
Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
Johnny, my Dad's home today.
Good luck at the academy.
I don't even know if you're my girl.
Shhh...
I said it. Isn't that enough ? Don't forget to write !
Hut... hut !
Uh, look, Diz...
This time of the year...?
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
Sounds more like some idiot at Military Intelligence Command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed...
I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform.
This would be mine, sir. Acting Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed command on this mission.
You heard the Sky Marshall... Move it all down -
Yeah, that's right.
Of course you don't. I doubt if any of you here would recognize 'civic virtue' if it bit you in the ass.
Good for you. Go find out.
Cover us, Ace !
V'ger is that which seeks the Creator.
You may proceede.
<U>Why</U>?!
<U>Answer</U>!
That is how V'ger will survive.
Spock...!  Get a fix on his position!
May I ask Why?
You are, Mister Decker. I'm afraid you'll have to double as Science Officer.
I'm aware of that, sir.
This served the purpose.
We have just seen that its body duplicates our navigator in <U>precise</U> detail. Suppose that beneath its programming, the real Ilia's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision.
He's in Engineering, sir...  He doesn't know.
Thrusters ahead, one third.
Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!
... is my only hope of accomplishing what the Masters could not.
I know this has been painful, Spock. For me too. Thank you.
Get someone up here to take the Navigator's station...!  Engineering... full emergency power!
No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.
Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
Aye, we understand that sir! We're doing our best.
Evening, Cal.  Would you tell me about it?
Annie...got an umbrella...?
I'm goin off-shift.  Come on...I'll walk you home.
Go you Huskies?
What's it called?
But why the dalmation?
No, no, I see...
As the Old Mill goes around...
No, no.  Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...
...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
I...
Wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance, do you see?  And <u>you</u> get a second chance!
...lost the screw...
Read the card.
Oh <u>okay</u>.
You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
Going home.
No.  You, I told them, you can't betray with the picture what you're saying with the words.  And, I don't know, the movies, I don't know.  They should be socially uplifting, why does she have to show her br...what is this...?
Gosh, you look nice.
Start back up the Waterford Sentinel. Town newspaper.  Show you the plans...
It does?
Yeah, you?
...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
But that's what happened.
Where have you been, we had a date for <u>three</u>...where have you <u>been</u>...?
Well, I <u>know</u>, because they <u>told</u> me you were with that writer from the, you see, this is what I mean, the whole <u>town</u> has been warped by the, by, by the presence of the movie company, they holler, and we jump, you have a <u>date</u>, they call, you're doing business nine o'clock at night.  It isn't...
He works on the movie.
That a fact.  Now, is it a good play?
What're you doing here...?
Well, they don't always leave with the ones they came in with.
That's what they call an events cluster. Some guy, nobby orders a Manhattan, fifteen, twenty years, allasudden, three times inna night.
What?
Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
And I need a drink.
What, what, what, what do they got that can pass for the Old Mill...
Waterford, Vermont.  Where is it?  <u>That's</u> where it is...
Nobody knows it but us.  Alright?  It says <u>here</u>...  Are we together on this?  Because it's sink or swim here, pals...
I loved it...he...
How old are you?
You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.
What...
No, you're absolutely r...
No, wait a, wait a, wait a...we can't put her in the car, she gets it in her head to sue, or rape, or some goddam, she wasn't in...
...I have to give you this <u>ticket</u> for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
It's night.
Well, I'm going to discuss 'em between you babe, cause it's your idea, and you think you're going to sign to do a, then hold us up in the <u>wilds</u> sweetheart, you are in <u>error</u>...
I'm not a <u>child</u>... I have <u>feelings</u>... Don't you...don't, don't...don't...
I love Jewish men.
That's my...
I...
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
Who are these from?
Listen to me:  Elanora <u>Duse</u> was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket.  She said, "I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for."  She said, "I cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  I am an artist. I'll do four shows a week."  The greatest actress of her time.  You know what her Producer said?
...yes...
...he's right here, Mr. Mayor...
Marty...
Who got their heads cut?
It's the truth that you should never trust anybody, wears a bowtie.  Cravat's sposed to point down to accentuate the <u>genitals</u>, why'd you wanna trust somebody, s'tie points out to accentuate his <u>ears</u>...?
...I just swore my life away, back in that...
Now:  the Waterford Merchant's Association, of who I am Council...
I want to talk to him.  Would you ex...
I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.
You mean <u>with White</u>...?
Not now.
I can't write it.  I lost my typewriter.
Then, you <u>write</u> that.  And then this is <u>our</u> second chance.  That's why we're here...
I know you do.
Hey, it's with the Gods.  We don't have the money, we have to write it out.  The best or not.  And that's a lesson.  You get your typewriter yet...?
He's got a date, he's got a date, is this guy fantastic...?  Already he learned how to write a movie, and he found a girl to get his toes curled, what a guy, what a...what a literary find...!
To the contrary.  I want you to tell the truth.  The truth is, you can't tell me, to a certainty, that you saw the thing.  You don't remember, a gun to your head, which glasses you have on.  And you have a fertile imagination.  Imagination wants to fill in the blanks.  Now.  If you aren't <u>sure</u>, then they have nothing.  Bob walks free.  As he should.  Joe:  wasn't long ago they buried actors at the crossroads with a stake through their heart.  You know?  The people who are talking to you about the way we live though we may praise them, we fear them. And they fear us.  Because we tell the truth.  About our lives.  Now, this is a damn roust, and everyone knows it; the guy is looking for a case, he wants to make a name for himself.  If we let him do that, if we let him do that, then we're being false to our community...to our community, you understand...?  To our world.  Cause you are a part of that world, now.  You have to take off the Steel Rolex and put on the Gold Rolex.  And be part of your world.  I got a five picture deal with the studio.  And you stick with me.  You write one, two more, you stick with me, and you'll <u>direct</u> the third one.  You are a part of this world. It's in your blood.  It's you.  You have to do the right thing:  we're out in the Provinces, the Sheriff, <u>literally</u> is at our door.  You have to stand with the troops, Joe.  That's the bottom line. You <u>have</u> to...if you had the leisure to think it through, you'd see it for yourself.  The girl wasn't in the car.
I don't getcha.
Then you're finished in show business.
It's lovely.
55 days and I take home the camera. I got an idea for a <u>product</u> placement...
He's got a gift for fiction.
That we could use you in and I think that's quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
And we're glad to have you here...
Yes, I hear it.
No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a lot of people are pretty upset...
But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.
Givvem a cigarette...
Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.
I don't want that to happen.  Why would I want that to happen?
What happens when he loves Rachel more than us?
Or blush.  You look pale.
Like how?
Are you <u>kidding</u>?  It is <u>so</u> much better than the one Rachel showed me!
Where's Rache?  It's <u>Thursday</u>, we get to be with <u>Rache</u>!
THEN TURN OFF THE CARTOON!
You don't like his friends.
Not with my mouth open.
You cannot <u>believe</u> what he said, it was the worst <u>instant</u> of my total life on <u>Earth</u>!!
This is my house too!
See, I...
Why don't you say hello?
Oh.  It's an incredibly disgusting, and not remotely sexy thing, that they described in a movie I'd never let you go to.  But it's real.  Does he have an older brother?
Alright starve.
No!
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
Thank you Ben.  Annabelle!
Does Rachel make a lot of money?
I think she's pretty, Mommy.
Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
Where are you, anyway?
Pray.  We never find out.
Is your bad?
No, it isn't.  Because it isn't everything.  And we want every- thing, don't we?
I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
Every day.  More and more.
Have you still never told him?
Sooner than later.  You really need to.
I'm here.  I've got a case where they're this close to sequestering the jury but have I answered the goddamn thing?!
Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age --
Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.
We've broken a lot of promises, haven't we Luke?
Partly.  But partly, you're mad.
Just not to me.
It's a huge moment in their life --
WE'RE still their parents for the next hundred years.
No.  You think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  You're on your own.
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?
Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
You mean for you.  A 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family.  She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen?  This isn't going to work out.
A court <u>order</u> is gonna say that <u>woman</u> is <u>never</u> <u>alone</u> with my children!  Ever <u>again</u>!  Do you HEAR that?
Those are <u>my</u> children you're practicing on.  They deserve <u>first-</u> rate care.  Every minute.  Of every night.  And every day.
Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
Jackie?
I was looking for Annabelle's book, and I found your tickets.  And the note.  From your new boss.
Toi.  They've been 'going out' for two weeks.
Right.  Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.
It's promising, this one.  We're upbeat.
Brad Kovitsky.
And you said...
...go to the park.  In the worst way.
Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
Is that what he told you?
Worked.  Like a charm.
That's not wh...
You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?
You weren't passing 'em out.
Oh please.
And she'll fight back again.  God help me, what have I done.
Don't flatter yourself.  I always liked that line.
Maybe I was wrong on that one.
You're the hip and fresh.
So I'll have to order in?
How about the promises we make to our kids?  About <u>their</u> future.  Do we shrug those off, just that easily?
Maybe he's gay.
What if he is?
Oh.
But that could've happened to him. Or to me, if I'd been alive. Or you.
Really? Well, all right! Let's take a look at the television and see how we look.
Yes, Mikey?
Really? How many?
No.
I did not go to high school.
We had to work. My family was poor.
This is work.
Speak English.
I am sure.
OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types.
I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.
Mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity. It's a very fine line.
Well, now you have.
Thank you for being honest.
...gger.
Nigger, fuck me hard!
Again!
All right, Scooby, let's not beat around the bush. With your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere.
Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off, so, uh...so I dropped out.
Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished.
I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
Three.
Great. How old are they?
Wow, that really is great. In a few years, who knows, maybe they'll want to be in my documentary!
It's my Dad's He hides it under some old TV Guides in his closet.
Gee, your Dad's smart.
I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just...a little nervous, I don't know why.
You should be.
I mean...
No, thanks.
Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
HBO and MTV have also shown some interest.
Yeah. He went to Harward.
Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
It seems to me we are just sailing away. They haven't sunk us yet, have they? Besides, don't you worry your pretty little head about that.  It's all been taken care of.
We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
Good.
Chemco is willing to deal with him, meet his demands.  I can have the money there in an hour.
We're secured.  Takeover team is in position and accounted for.
Richter-we got a problem!
Captain it would be impossible to turn down such a gracious request.
Dissent?
The thing weighs more than a ton-- you want to roll up your sleeves and try it?!
How much of this shit do they have, White!!
There's enough in one vial...
The food - you wouldn't put - anything in it, would you?
Our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices, jacketed in Cobalt-Thorium-G would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio- activity from which no human life could escape. In ten months the Earth would be as dead as the Moon.
The report is entirely untrue.  I can assure you of that.
I know nothing of the sort!
Don't you realize that despite your incredible distrust and suspicion, that in fact, you place a far greater trust in us than inspection would require?  You trust us not to cause a war accidentally - and, of course, we are obliged to place the same trust in you.
What do you think of this, Mister President?  I told you we shouldn't let him in here.
Well, you can't do that because he's dead.
What?
They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.
Now look here, Miss Pietraszkiewicz, this is Air Command Headquarters calling.
What kind of trouble?
Well, sir, about forty-six minutes ago one of my base commanders, General Jack D. Ripper, sent out attack orders to the thirty-four B-90's of the 843rd Bomb Wing, under his command.
Damn it!  Damn it!  I've been telling you all for years you've got too damned many psychoes in the service.
I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to take the film out.
This is General Ripper speaking.
A shooting war!
Please don't take any notice of this weapon, Major.  I love all weapons, and as of late, I've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.
Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General?
Yes, sir.  General, can I ask a question?
Because I thought it proper, Major.  Why else would you think I'd do it?
Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this?  I mean why do you want to start the war?
I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.
Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.
But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
Well, what about the Positive Control, the safety catch?  Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?
Mister President, to guard against espionage, the three letter of the code group for Plan-R are always selected by the lower echelon commander himself, just before each mission.  They are sealed in the various attack plans and are known only to the lower echelon commander and his deputy.  In this case the deputy is air-borne with the Wing, and General Ripper refuses to recall the planes.
But we can't communicate with the base.
Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
Can't help it.  What's the wind like?
Fifteen!  Twelve o' clock.
What?
Forget it, Quentin.  It can happen to the best of us.  Now let's get squared away.
Roger, keep calling them.  Knock off auto-pilot, Ace.
Lieutenant Toejam, why don't you help him?
Look, can't someone help me?
Yeah, it sure looks like the real thing, all right.
Our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities, right?
First safety.
Seond safety.
Binky?
But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour.
Look, King, maybe you've lost too much blood, or something.
But I get a red light.
"Burger Manifesto, Part One" is gonna make people think?
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
Why is everything about you, Jeff?
No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
Do you wanna go to the van?
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.
What?
No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.
It's your birthday?
That's the rock star thing.
Jesus Christ.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
Watch out for that tree.
... idiot! Open the damn door! Go, go, go, come on!
So you can do an album cover?
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
No. Life is too short.
Good.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica?
No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?
Hey, man.
She's dead?
Yeah, man.
Great.
Buff is funny. God.
Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is gonna teach me how to surf in L.A.
I can come visit?
You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay.
Oh, thanks. Thanks.
I didn't want to eat this much, man.
Wait, I'll get you some air.
Mm.
Really?
Erica.
I know. It's okay.
I'm sorry.
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
Oh, wow.
Hi, I'm Erica.
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
Sooze wants to see him.
Oh, shut up, Tim. This isn't funny, man.
I hit her.
No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.
Wow. You did that for me?
Yes.
Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
I'm a loser. And I'm drunk. But I'm not gutless.
Is that Bee-Bee?
I don't know.
You could've come over.
I don't want to hear it anymore.
Yes, I stand for -
I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
You know, all you know is what's good for you.
Can I talk?
How?
My goal is to make art.
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
Mm-mm.
No, I don't.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
Why don't you just try? Please. For me. Come on.
No, it's not...
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex.
Oh, man, we were pretty on tonight.
Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things.
Now?
Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
Go ahead! They love you just about as much as I do.
Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
Hey it's your roof. It's your fucking problem.  Hi, uh, there's an emergency down at the Circle A on first Street, Yeah, Okay.  You're fucked now, pal!  Um, send an ambulance 'cause I, I think it's an overdose or something. Okay. Okay.  Jeff, they're coming. Just wait here. I'm gonna go over to Scuff's and see if he's got his truck.  Listen, if she dies, you're gonna be so sorry that you ever showed your brown face in this town!
Oh, yeah, just sitting there eatin' a salad, you know. That kind of thing happens all the time in L.A. It's, you know... I met Johnny Depp.
You have to go. You always did such, uh, you know, great work. I still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall.
Alright!
Hey, man, uh, look, if you don't like my stuff, uh, I won't sing it, okay? I'm sorry, you know?
No, I'm going.
Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out why I left in the first place, you know? I think about people and I wonder what they're doing.
Really? What else does your mother say?
"I sound like an idiot watching the parade I know there's no tomorrow only the charade I am dead Deep inside my head All the lies There's no then Only now I will love show me how"
I called Bucky's. I got her a cab. Is there any hot mustard?
About what?
Yeah?
Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.
I'm here.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
You know the fuck not.
Fuck.
I just pulled and it - it came off.
You just became a statistic!
Conan went to Harvard.
Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
It's off... I can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility. We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls!
Look, I might be moody.  I might be gassy.  But I am perfectly sane.  Think about it.  In school, they tell us, "Dreams can come true."  Right?
If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
Well...
I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.
What?!  But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records...
Well, I want to know what happened --
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
Stop, you're gonna make me cry.
I'm sorry, Diane, but I'm not gonna watch my dreams fade away 'cause the Virgin Mary here thinks she's gonna get ideas from kiddie movies --
She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.
That you?
Kim-Lo?
Fern!  C'mere!  She's siphoning tanks - takes a sec to cap off the cyanide hose.
We're dead!  They showed this prison movie to my youth group on Sunday.
Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
Uh...Yeah, Grandma.  She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.
You damn well better...
She did, did she?  How is the old girl?
Uh...maybe?
Thank G-d.  I was starting to think I'd killed the wrong man.
My best friend got pregnant.
Before you?  Whoo-hoo!
Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom!  Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  Now I have to add, "P.S. My mom's a dyke" too?
What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
I want to help.  I'm part of this squad...
Listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough?
Action! The scene starts.
Don't worry.  She's just a fan for my literary output.
Someone in the formal set, no doubt, with a ten-carat kidney stone.
About that luggage.  Where's the phone?
I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
Why, you sweet kid.
I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
Phillip, you're mad!
Life can be beautiful!
What teacher?
What about all those ideas you had?
I'll make it short.
I'm all tied up.  I can't.
You're on your own.  Stop being chicken-hearted and write that story.
I'll say.  This is solid gold.
What were you -- a child actress?
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there.  It would kind of save us a honeymoon.
Jealous.  Ever see so much junk? She had the ceiling brought from Portugal.  Look at this.
I'm trying to tell you.  This is an enormous place.  Eight master bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every bathroom.  There's a bowling alley in the cellar.  It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do.  A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself?
No.
Yes, I did.
And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.
We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
It is not.  Get out.
I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color.
Get out.
That's where the popcorn business comes in.  You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.
Sure have.  The last one I wrote was about cattle rustlers. Before they were through with it, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.
Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
Of course not.  But it ought to be organized.  Just an editing job.  You can find somebody.
Thank you.
I'll come early tomorrow.
I don't need a tuxedo.
Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.
Cute.  Let's have some drinks.
Good.
All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?
Why don't you? I'm writing a script and I'm dying to finish it, no matter what.
Sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us.  That car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there's going to be fireworks.
You say the cutest things.
Forget Romanoff's.  It's the car I'm talking about.  If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.
If it was a quarrel, how come you had the gun right there?
This guy -- where did you meet him for the first time?  Where did he come from? Who is he?
Okay.  And let's have the car right outside.
Paramount studios.
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
Eliminate her.
The Naming of Names is not necessary. Just concentrate on her face. Your Shadow will do the rest.
It's for your own protection.
I'm taking you to the hospital.
My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...
We can't do that.
No.
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
You can't just abandon me.  Alone.
I sort of like what you said.
Miss what?
What I had before. What's not there now. It's like I woke up and found part of me wasn't there any more: something that made me feel really alive and aware of things. It was like, for the first time in my life, everything fitted together perfectly---you and me and the world around us--like we were a wonderful song...
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
Just one kiss. For old times' sake.
Turn it against her.
I'll come back as soon as I can.
Do you want to come to Argo City?
Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
I'll drink to that.
I know it.
It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.
I don't know. You seem afraid.
Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants.
How Lucy and that guy got to the hospital. And all that damage at the school. The police are calling it a freak tornado. I'd like to interview you for the Daily- -
Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
You bet your ass.
Why didn't you tell me?
You're supposed to guess.
As brave as my father. As wise.
It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.
Where is Earth?
This is all your clothes?
I'd rather not talk about it.
She's a beast.
It doesn't seem right.
Please, as a favour to me? So I won't  be the only girl?
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
I know.
No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too--- if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity--- no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it.
No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a sip of this? It's delicious, I think.
Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
There's no vodka in it.
Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
Hey, man, that's a great name for a cocktail!
For reminding me, I mean. Can you follow me?
Oh...I came close once.
I thought "Clark Kent has a really nice voice." You didn't even know I was there.
Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
I mean him.
Pate? What pate?  I didn't make any --  Oh, no, Clark. That's Buster's dog food.
Me neither...
Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
Oh, I wouldn't want to -- I mean, I'd want to, but I wouldn't want to...be a nuisance to you.
Sure.
Take me, for instance. Going back to middle America after having become a Metropolis sophisticate --
Exactly what I was about to ask about me.
Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
What's that?
Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? "Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet.
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
One.  And a half.
Mr. Gorman, just answer me one question...
'Cause I know about getting' them half-centses?
Decaffeinated too?
I did. isn't it neat-o?
They ain't got captains?
Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.
Fair's fair.
For what?
Everything.
Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
The bridge...?  I'd better get going!
He can have mine. Anytime.
Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?
TOMORROW THE OIL!
We already have a super-tanker.
What's wrong?
Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you.  Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?
But this should be exposed. They get	kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says.
Oh sure, everything is complimentary. Until you get the bill.
And you weren't. As usual. What do you say to that?
No, of course not, Lois. You just get carried away sometimes. Believe me, I understand --
Oh come on, that's ridic -
Maybe you wanted to.
Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .
Your place?  Maybe I should change,  Maybe you should, too.
He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.
What??
A parka.
Genius!  --  Lex.
He knows where the Eiffel Tower is, Olsen.  You do, don't you, Kent?
Maybe we just don' t know his game plan.
Australia.
Well . . . it's been more like a fortress than a home.  Until now.
We have not the choice to refuse, have we, if we believe it is a real hydrogen bomb that they have.
DELETE IN CUTTING 		) There . . .  A place called . . . Houston . . .
		DELETE IN CUTTING
Stay. I will come to you.
Yes?
I really don't think . . .
But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
That's not what we were taught. 'Look out for number one' -- that's daddy's golden rule ... he always ends up with the gold.
Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.
Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story.
No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.
I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.
Well, I'm feeling a lot better . . . almost chipper . . .  . . . and all because I had a visit from a very good nurse.
Gee guys, that's swell of you. But  . . . I've got another idea.
Absolutely!
Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
He has all of Superman's powers. If I've planned it right. . .
There!
He's . . .  beautiful. Perfect.
Ready, Uncle Lex?
Lucky I brought my drums.
Still having delusions, Lex Luthor?
Otherwise, you're a Mongoloid idiot.  It's reasonable to assume that fragments of the planet were shot out into space by the force of the explosion, and  --
Well!
Clark Kent, if you had only seen it the way I did, you -
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
You're not the only one.
Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.
Your father was a sick weirdo.
This??
You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
What about dinner? I have to worry about the crime of the century, that's all. Y'know? Am I supposed to worry about what's in the refrigerator, too?  What's in it?
He's from another world.
Deductive reasoning, my friends! That's the name of the game. What does it say here?
What do you suggest, my dear?
I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
Something you can feed the pets, perhaps?  Let's have it.
Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.
But so is Vond-El
Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.
Don't just stand there gapin' Jonathan. Can't you see he's cold?
Don't brag now,  Jonathan.
Well, physiologically, he...	won't quite fit.
And it is forbidden for you to interfere with human history. All you can do, Kal-El, even now that you have...found yourself...is help them to evolve. Set an example. Show them they must strive towards the light. And... remember us...
It must feel great.
195 pounds.
What about it?
Uh-huh.
Is it true you're impervious to pain?
Well, I was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. It's in the Xeno Galaxy. Or it was. It was called Krypton. That's K-R-Y-P...
I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.
But...why?
Oh, that. Listen  --  you're busy  --  and it's a long story --
In a way  -- oh, it'll be a relief. I'm a wreck. No rest for the wicked, y'know. It wasn't enough, the radio frequencies, then I had to worry about getting to the missile and adjusting the aiming. So that if I could have activated the launch  -- well, Lex Luthor would've hit the spot.  There's a little place on Route 190. Dead on the practice optimum stress point of the San Andreas Fault. It wouldn't mean much to you, Superman, but I call it...target zero.  Pancho's Taco Palace...
Ally.  That's right.
Which one?
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
Alison.
The Walkers have agreed.  The Ottos. Nicole Burnell's parents.  It's important to initiate proceedings right away.  Things get covered up. People lie.  That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight.
Okay.
Say hello for me.
Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.
But yours is the one who's going to subpoena me, Sam.  Force me to testify in court.  He came by the garage this afternoon.  Gave me this piece of paper.
It's natural.
Something made this happen, Billy. Mr. Stephens is going to find out what it was.
Oh yes.  Like I said, they always came out together to see him off to school.  It's like he was their little treasure.  He was such a beautiful boy.  That's a picture of him on the wall there, behind Abbott.
No, nothing like that.  Billy's wife, Lydia, died of cancer a few years ago.  He took over raising the children by himself.  It was obvious how much he missed Lydia.
I did.
That's what he said.
Oh.
Nicole?
The people in the town?
Yes.  Like Bear and the Ansel twins and Sean and...
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
You seem very sure about that.
Thank you, Nicole.
Will you be spending more than a night?
Perfect.
Here we go.
Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window?  How old was I, Daddy?  Five or six?  I got absolutely soaked, remember?
Why are you calling me, Zoe?
'Cause you think I'm stoned, Daddy? 'Cause you think I've got a needle stuck in my arm?  Is that what you're thinking, Daddy?
I'm calling because I've got some news for you, Daddy.  Some big news.
Poached salmon.
Is there shrimp on it?
I'm a lawyer.
You can't come here.
Isn't that what you want us to believe?  That we're completely defenseless?  That you know what's best?
You are?
Yes.
Yes, I understand.
Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this?
I told you I was positive.  The speedometer was large and easy to see from where I was.
Of course.
You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
Pretty slick, eh?
My lawyer?  Why do I need a lawyer?
How will he do that?
Will the police do anything to her?
Someplace where no one knows her.  Someplace strange and new.
That's right!  Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first!
Hitler!
Hurry back.
Serious as a deacon...I like it.  I like your style, son!  In a world of old rags and bones, I like it! For instance, take Sidney.
Why, has he bothered you before?
I'm afraid I can't cope with them.
No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...
Ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell!
Who said Sidney?
I thought we were talking about Sidney?
Before you leave, son, I'll answer your question---Susan Hunsecker is the injured party here!  Or will I be hearing next that I don't even have my sister's welfare at heart...
Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night.  Still alive?
Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
Not just this minute, J.J....
I like Harry, but I can't deny he sweats a little.
I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.
Correct me if I'm wrong - WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved.
You're picking up my lingo, hon.
And who's feet is she on now?
What's this boy got that Susie likes?
But not for anything I did today...
Susie, there's nothing wrong with Dallas!  Your brother and I arranged it all. And if the Leslie boy is still a squooshy item in your life, forget it! - your brother arranged that one, too!  I don't usually give away presents; but this is my gift to you: Get out of here!  Leave this man!
What kind of an act is this?
Take a top coat.
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
That's your idea of logic?  I tell the Judge I didn't murder the man - the Judge says, "Why not you?"
Cheers.  What time is it, Al?
I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean.
I told your brother I couldn't be his accomplice.  I can't be yours either, Susie, and encourage him to go on pulverizing you.  I know what type - he's my old man all over again!
Oh.  I can't, honey.  I'm on a roll here.
Liquid metal.
I would.
It can't form complex machines.  Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  It doesn't work that way.  But it can form solid metal shapes.
You just can't, okay?  Trust me on this.
No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.
I guess, yeah --  Oh shit!!
Where you going?!
No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!
Alright, it!  We need it!
Look, Mom, if I'm supposed to ever be this great leader, you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while.  'Cause if you won't, nobody else will.
I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who's responsible?
Uh huh.
SHOOT!!!!
Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...
Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.
And what it that?
Unknown.
Correct.
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
Then what?
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
You think you're alive and safe, but you're already dead.  Everybody, you, him...  everybody... you're all fucking dead!
Eating is eating... and...
David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.
Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
So, what does the Russki want?
A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters.
Let Furtwängler go. Please.
Duty? I am sorry, duty? Duty fucking duty. Trouble is, you Americans want everybody to live like you. We liberated Berlin, Major Steve, not you. Our duty also is to bring back the best of German culture.
Your mother, too.
Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.
There have been messages for you.  A Lieutenant David Wills called from the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs office in Wiesbaden. I don't know who he is.
No. Ours was damaged.
Of course.
Put it on ready to play, and I'll tell you when to play it.
What is this, Emmi?
What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwängler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.
Why were they going to arrest you?
Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?
I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost.
'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
I don't have to think carefully. This is utterly ridiculous.
Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?
I'll tell you, then. The last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal Hitler had shot himself. Listen to it.  They listen. Did they pick little K's recording? Did they pick some other conductor? No, they picked you, and why? Because you represented them so beautifully. When the Devil died, they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march. You were everything to them.
Excuse me. Did you know that he refused to give the Nazi salute when Hitler was present in the audience?
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
One of my people?
His private life?
But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.
Sure.
Right. Claims assessor.
Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube has to take down what you say.
You're late.
Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
Just what you see, pal.
All.
That's none of your business.
Aha!  Is she young?
Yes.  Don't hurt me.
One possible future.  Four your point of view.  I don't know the tech stuff.
Hunter Killers.  Patrol machines. Build in automated factories. Most of us were rounded up, put in camps...for orderly disposal.
I volunteered.
It was an honor.  A chance to meet the legend.  Sarah Connor.  Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid.  When you were in hiding, before the war.
John gave me a message for you.  Made me memorize it. 'Sarah"...this is the message... 'Sarah, thank you.  For your courage through the dark years. I can't help you with what you must soon face, except to tell you that the future is not set... there is no such thing as Fate, but what we make for ourselves by our own will.  You must be stronger than you imagine you can be.  You must survive, or I will never exist.'  That's all.
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
Molecular-memory.
Yes.  And I don't want to know where you got it.
I want it to be over for you.
Good fighters.
Oh, Kyle.
Kyle...
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
Of course.
Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic.
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
I guess so.  You're a doctor?
I can't sleep.
Six shots at less than ten feet.  Weapon was a large caliber--
No.  Keep getting an answer- ing machine.
My stock's falling.  Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.
Because it's fair.  Give me next quarter.  If you still feel this way, vote your shares...
What?
I want to know what's going on.  Are you part of this?
What <u>is</u> your problem?
Home.
Never mind.
If there was one.
Are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
My hero.  Let's go.
Consumer Recreation Services.  It's their building.  They...
If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed.
Don't.  It was a shitty job anyway. I overreacted.
Right.  Call me Christy.
Seriously?  What did they say?
They said five hundred.  I said six. They said the man in the gray flannel suit.  I think I said, you mean the attractive guy in the gray flannel suit?
They did the same to him as they did to you.
I didn't say anything.
I don't know.  A lot.
I'm back from the dead.
Nicholas, okay... you're not about to shoot anyone...
Nicholas...
Shut up!
Originally, Connecticut.
Big family... small?
Studied acting, I assume?
Julliard, yeah.
Always.
"Seymour Butts."  I never get tired of that one.
About me?
Elizabeth?
Really?
What have they been doing to you?
Do you know how to change a tire?
Where's Christine?  The waitress.
Of course, Nick...
I'll call.  I really will.
Oh, here we go...
Tailored specifically to each participant.  Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
And if nothing's lacking?
An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.
It's all down to this...
It was a different floor then...
Like, this way... sort of...
Have we met?
No, you didn't...
No, thank you.  Goodnight.
There's been a break in.  Lock this door and stay here.  Don't move a muscle.
Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
Let me think...  Hordes of men in tuxedos.  Everyone's droning.  Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick...
Because, if you don't know about society, you don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it.
Follow me.
Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know?
It's what they do.  It's like... being toyed with by a bunch of...  Depraved children.
<u>Every</u> year is a good year.
Obsessive worrier.  Join the club.  And you?  I'd guess...
I did okay.
It's somebody's idea of a joke.
Is this true?  I've been hypnotized?
She got the child labor stuff from me.
He must have left.  Didn't like the looks of the place or something.
You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
We can't stay here looking for her.  She doesn't want to be found...
Come on Malcolm, it's only seven ohms, it's nothing, it's like a joy buzzer!  And it's not about the pain, it's about the interference with concentration...
You don't believe in the paranormal.
Well... we're glad to have you.
Theo I think.  You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on?
That smell... oh, God.
It was very specific.
In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table.  It smelled like that wood.
I got more scared.
I wish I were.  I wish I had done it, then I could confess and you'd be at peace.  That great moral philosopher Frank Sinatra once said to someone he loved, I wish you had an enemy, so I could beat him up.
I don't know.
This is where we're going?
No, but Nell's been here longer than I have.
Every day.  Basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening.
How could you do this to people?
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.
That's why we're here.
That depends.
I don't have anyone.  But I do have a little apartment of my own.  It has a little flower garden.  You can just see the ocean.  At night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the buoys in the harbor.
The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace, it was a tomb.  Why didn't he tell us?
You know it wasn't a joke, Theo.
David?  David Watts?  Can you hear us?  David!  Daviiiiid!
No, it's getting worse.
Just think about one thing right now: What color?
I do.
Just had to be sure.
Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
Is that a problem?
What kind of food?
Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
I sure hope so.
Come over here.
This is un-fucking professional.
Our black friends?
Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
We'll find him.
You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
I saw your mother on the Strip last night.  She went up to three guys, said she'd like 'em to stick one in each, know what I mean?
No problem.  If <u>you</u> don't have a problem with me reporting this gun stolen.
Lookin' good.
I mean, what has it been -- six months?
I only asked.
These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.
Well, there you are.  Jen must've liked him.
Has he?
First in, first out, that's me.
The lot.  The whole British bloody Post Office.  I had a brilliant plan -- all worked out -- work of genius, it was. Could I get anybody interested?  No -- they're too busy pinching orange squash from the milkman.  Lazy sods.  Jumble sale on in Watford, they'll be up at the crack of dawn.
Really.
Not no more, they ain't.  I quit that acting shit, man.
Hell, no.  I started writing.
No, but I know what he means.
She used to pinch 'em off me.  Funny that.  One thing she never tried to get me to stop.
Sewing mailbags?  Me?  Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. Wasn't about to start when I was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands.
And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
Here, are you always this sarky?
Not embarrassed.
She never told Eddie, though.
In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first.
He give me your address.
Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
She'd never called me like that before. She sounded more ... pissed off -- angry -- than upset or afraid.  But she never turned up.  I called the house but only got the answer machine.  When they found her ... she'd been going the wrong way. Not the direction she'd have gone if she'd been coming to see me.  Or coming <u>straight</u> to see me.  Who knows.  Maybe she just wanted to drive.
Oh, I was gonna say ...
Did you.  What was that in aid of?
Just now?  Overnight?
What'd your father do?
What's in Big Sur?
My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.
I can never decide what I like better. Leaving home, or coming back.
I got half.
The forever kind.
That don't mean nothin'.
So what.
What?
I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.
They're at college.  Or doesn't your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore.
That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame.  It's that simple.
Have we met?  There's something I can't quite --
Tell me.
Ann--
I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
Oh, Mr Crane--
I have to do it. I can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain. You're young, you don't understand.
Ah... it's nothing.
Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
Ah.
Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
Uh--
What's involved, aside from putting up the money? What're you looking for the partner to do?
You're out of line, mister.
Yeah.
No, Dave, I wasn't.
Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
What kind of man *are* you?
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
Don't tell 'em anything. We're getting you Freddy Riedenschneider.
No. Of course not. She didn't do it.
Good! That helps. Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!--one less thing to think about. Now. Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell *you* what to say. No talking out of school. What's out of school? Everything's out of school. I do the talking; you keep your trap shut. I'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything. Understood?
...OK.
Good! Any questions give me a ring-- Turandot suite; if I'm out leave a message. You sure you don't want anything? No?
Terrific. Your husband backs you up. That's terrific.
How did you get into the store?
I tried to tell him the whole story, but Riedenschneider stopped me. He said the story made his head hurt, and anyway he didn't see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of Big Dave...
No thanks.
Yeah. What do I, uh...
Well, of course, I, uh, it's out of my league, criminal stuff. I do, uh, probate, real estate, title search, uh... I'd be absolutely worthless, something like this. Absolutely worthless.
So--
Uh-huh. He's the, uh...
Yeah, the best.
Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long distance here.
Uh-huh.
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
Now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. For the kids there's the Butch, or the Heinie...
Sure, go to the store. Go there, describe to the man where you will be fishing, and for what, and the weather conditions, sun, no sun, whatnot, and so forth, and then you might as well have the man go ahead and sell you the goddamn FISH, Ed...
Yeah.
...You ever wonder about it?
Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare the kid.
The hell with it, Eddie!
They too use the toilet, Ed. In spite of appearances. And their money will be secured by the barbershop. A rock. A *rock*, the barbershop. I mean, how long has *this* place been here?
My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner.
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
It's too late now.  Guests are arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling up.
Yes.
Let's go!
To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while...
Where the hell are you?
I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight.
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
Then you won't like this one.  It's a piece of shit.
I believed them.
Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run!
The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea.
I hope you liked it.
Yes.  Two organs the size of a walnut have been removed with what looks like surgical precision.
I don't believe it.
My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
That thing could kill ten people in a matter of minutes.
No, Dr. Frock.  You can't.
Happy to be useful.  It's rare enough these days.  According to security, Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.
And failed.  These doors are solid steel.
Read it out loud.
"Dear Louis, Tomorrow we go to the south end of the tepui where we'll be in the greatest danger, so I'm sending Carlos back with the crates.  You always believed in me, Louis, even in the darkest days.  So it gives me great pleasure to tell you your faith has been rewarded.  We've made an incredible find.  I enclose a representation of Mbwun.  Note the exaggerated claws, the reptilian attributes, the hints of bipedalia. It's beyond belief, but this statue is accurate.  I know because I've seen the beast."
Yes, I do.
Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class.
Chicken.  This is a great short cut.
Heel Argo!  Hobbes!  Heel!
Keep the animal quiet.
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but you know me.  Telegraph. Telephone.  Tell Kawakita.  I got the definitive word from Cuthbert's secretary.  This is Dr. Frock's last week.
It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.
Pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains!
How about lunch?
You have time to talk?
You were going to be married.
I ran an internet search on Dr. Whittlesley.  Got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the Times.  I also found a record of your restraining order.
A legendary monster called Mbwun.
What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one?
My God.  Then it was an animal.
I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.
I heard you calling and I ran after you, but you kept disappearing and I couldn't keep up.
How?
That thing is John Whittlesley.  I should have seen it before!  The fibers are infected with a virus. You eat them, and the virus alters your DNA!  He became addicted to them in South America, followed the plants back to the states.  He probably entered the country as a man.  It would have taken several months for the change to take place. That's how he got from the boat to the museum!
It's the busy season.
Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, I came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it.
A window onto the human condition?
We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?
There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.
I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.
<i>A show.</i>  Then who am I?
Now.
If we don't go now, it won't happen.
Yeah?  Outta what?
Outta my job, outta Seahaven, off this island...<i>out!</i>
Sorry, I'm way behind.
<i>Mixed up?</i>  Mixed up in what?
Your Dad?!
I told you I can't.
Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.
Truman, you're gonna be late!
It's a surprise.
Maybe I feel like a teenager.
I thought we were going to try for a baby.  Isn't that enough of an adventure?
I made macaroni.
I don't know--
There's been an accident, Truman.
You're part of this, aren't you?!
Do something...
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
Leak at the plant.  They had to shut her down.
--It doesn't matter.  Everybody knows about it.  They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared.
You must listen.  Everybody's pretending, Truman.
Well, we're FBI agents.
A woman?  Work.
You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
Yes. I know.
Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.
There are complications.
Selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer.
Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.?
Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight.
S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?
Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.
A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.
And why do you think it is you're standing here talking to me? These people don't make mistakes, Agent Mulder.
I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.
I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street.
The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
Scully, I found the bomb.
I'm in the vending room.
-- Mulder! Get in the car!
Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.
No.
There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous.
I don't know.
Mulder --
That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.
That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.
Where would they be going?
We've got two choices. One of them is wrong.
I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this.  Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder.
Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --
I think... something stung me.
I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
I want to know where Scully is.
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
What alien environment?
No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.
A pocketful of rye...
A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
No.  No.
I know him.
Peter, okay?
Then what is he?
What happened to Charles Gish?
Tell me.
I got it.
No.  Thank you.
Just graduated law school.  Single mom. Had a two-year-old daughter.
No.
Any psychiatric medication?
What about the cat?
Now?
They're in that fucking thing for forty hours, Gordon.  Four-oh.  He got Julia at seven-thirty last night.  You know what time it is now...?!
Ja, ja, ja.
Silly looking bunch.
Where is she?
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
We're both in it, Harry.
Wait here.
He told you, didn't he?
Well, don't preach wisdom to me. You talk about him as if he had occasional bad manners.
There isn't enough for two laughs.
Why should he help me like that? The Russians will only make trouble for him.
We're getting you out of here, aren't we?
If you want to sell your service, I'm not willing to be the price... I loved him. You loved him. What good have we done him. Look at yourself, they have names for faces like that.
They're Harry's.
No.
I was a friend of Harry Lime.
No, not yet.
Thank you.
Martins.
Been here long?
No, sorry.
What?
Him dying like that.
Getting around, Martins.
You're not locking her up?
I'm only a little fool - I'm an amateur at it - you're a professional. You've been shaking your cap and bells all over town.
Are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder?
I can't. He disappeared...
I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.
I'd like to visit Texas one day, sir.
Well, look, is there a car here I can use?
I've heard of him, of course, but I didn't exactly know him.
The author. Thought you might be interested.
Very popular. Are you staying long?
Excuse me, have you got tooth...
It's good to see you, Holly.
Tough...tough...Don't worry, old man, they won't hurt her.
You don't care anything at all about Anna, do you?
You wouldn't do anything.
Outside of your stories...I've got to be careful.
Sure...
At the end of every chapter --
All right - I'm mad. I've seen a ghost...
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
In great pain?
Yes, yes, I remember you.
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
What does he say?
No, no. He came late after they carried him to the Joseph Statue.
Das hat man davon wenn man freundlich ist mit den auslandern...
I am not a bad man.
Not necessarily.
A friend of mine offered me a job here.
Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.
That's the wrong one.
Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is.  Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!!
They sound like you.
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
I don't, but...
The mystics tried to read the white spaces around the letters. They thought there was a whole alternative language hidden there, with secret, alternative meanings.
This? This is a joke.  I'll give your group a thousand bucks.
I don't care about money.
Where'd you read all that stuff?
You want it to be an event.
They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.
No.
They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....
They don't put them in the Torah. I'll get you a chumash, they'll have them there...Bet...Gimel...Dalid...Hay...  How come you're here instead of with Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons...
No. Nothing follows. You don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You're not saved. Nobody's saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the Torah.
You eat first, then you light.  Once you light, it's Yom Kippur, which means you're fasting, so you can't...eat.
You gotta get out of here.
Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes.
He called me up. He wanted to talk to me about my ideas.
We need intellectuals, we have enough thugs already.
Obviously.
Notice? Like what...?
I don't think you know what you are.
It was a nine millimeter.
I was just talking. I -- look, I can't help what I think.
...I want you to do it on the outside, too.
Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should --
You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that?
But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?
Here...
What's that?
What did you do while the sergeant was killing your son?
Dennis Leary.
'Cause they got rid of Johnson. He knew how to deal with the assholes. Dallas Green, please...
They're not that Jewish.
I was just trying to make a point. If --
...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming....
Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things?
Yes.  Not like Enzo.
Yes.
Maybe you should talk to him about it.
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
... You take care of yourself, Johana.
Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has the same signature as the contractor!
Enzo Molinari.
Johana Cross, pleased to meet you.  Well!  Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here.  It's incredible!
Listen to her!  "That's what he's here for"!  He's here to loose, that's what he's here for.  First of all, I'm unbeatable.  Second, how old are you?
Enzo, stop bitching, will you?
Because you'd laugh.
Six seconds.
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
And where did you say you were from?
And... does the voice come back?
Fine!
No.  All you need is to want to be the best.
You don't have a room?  Paolo?  What did I just hear?  I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!
... You married?
You're staying at the hotel?
Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.
... I'm listening.
What is it?
Yes.
I don't want to erase anything.
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
... Yes.
The guy in the Halloween suit!
We saw each other a little while ago.
I don't know... why?
Lucky I was there to save you.
Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
How do you know that?
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
... It's hard you know.  You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.
... Not at all.
Absolutely positive.
Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.
Promise you won't forget me.
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
What?
Johana... New York.
They got the new T.V.
What?
How was your trip?
Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
You look it too.  You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins!  You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
Why is he doing this?
You've made me a happy insurance person.
... Yes?
Let him sleep.
Hey, it's your Bar Mitzvah. I'm just readin' the Torah portion.
My Esther! Oh Mordechai.
He works too much. God forbid he should have a nice Jewish girl come eat by him once in a while. Take his mind off his work. Maybe a blowjob here and there.
Sorry I'm late. Traffic was a pisher, and I've been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking. What are you listening to?
Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
Afterwards they'll make the decision as to whether or not they'd like to continue their religious studies in Israel. Because, hey, after all we'll have practiced the highly effective assertive democratic style of child rearing, sprinkled with a healthy dose of liberalism.
I forgive you.
I can see. And you also brought a nice girl to come eat by us.
Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos.
I understand that. I just thought that you might want to know.
It's cool. It's cool. Aveenooh Shalom Alechem, brother.
If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
I don't know. Why don't you ask them sir.
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
Take a look.
And my leopard - - maybe he hurt the first girl -- but no more.
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
You really think so, Charlie?
Let's get in your truck.
The elderly man I told you about.
Tomorrow -—
At four. He will be there at four.
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed -— He'll come up with something.
That's right, of course.
It doesn't jibe with this —— you told me the leopard would go out into the country —- it wouldn't stay in the city ——
Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
About Charlie's leopard?
Charlie likes his leopard.
Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
No.
Tell me.
Various reasons.  But I can't see why you'd be interested in the rather dusty career of William Galbraith — teacher, naturalist, curator -- when you lead such a gay and exciting life yourself.
No —- really, I can see them -- they're coming now -— turn off the lights ——
Ask Kiki. Ask any woman. Girls don't put on lipstick in the middle of the night on a dark, lonely street unless they're with a man or expecting a man.
Yes. And I am taking it to headquarters for examination.
Makes no difference. Get him out!
No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
Now look what you've done.
And I suppose you don't feel bad!
We all, had to look at the body. It was awful, Kiki -- awful!
You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
You're positive of that, aren't you?
I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.
I got into a little crap game.
That's funny -- I never knew you to lose that much before --
Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.
Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside -— where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.
Kiki, Galbraith said something to me once, -- something you ought to know. We were talking and he said that people were like that ball on the fountain at the hotel --they got pushed around by things bigger than themselves. That's the way it was with us -- and we were too small to see it that way.
Must it?
Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.
I need the money to smooth my way, you understand? Now, have you got that sort of cash here or do we need to meet in the morning?
Look, Mrs De Moraes, however much of a let down it might be, your brother’s not back to his old weekend tricks! Impressionable as he is, he probably grew tired of healthy girls in grisly poses, tried moving on to bigger things, came upon more than he’d bargained for and somehow fancied he could take on the real world. Which he no doubt chanced upon on his way to that thing now sitting on your table... Have a look at it, Mrs De Moraes. I told you I had bad news...
Have you got a pen?
The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...
...7548. Have you... Have you found him yet?
Paul Lamont...?
When did you get back?
You’re repeating yourself, Mrs De Moraes.
Why... I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? He’s a client of mine and a friend of your husband.
Leon hung himself.
Leon’s not found, your parents worry, talk of hiring help to find him, even mention their manhunter friends perhaps... and Adonis panics, takes control, brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward, not before Leon’s found anyhow. He must have kicked himself when he learned I’d exceeded his expectations.
...You-you spoke to him?
Is there anything to understand?
What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child supplier’s being tailed?
What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?
You seem to know what you’re talking about.
To get me killed...?
I didn’t intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that you’d been back.  That we’d argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldn’t help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
We? You and your parents killed your husband?
The staff don’t know yet...  I called my parents, told them everything...  I just couldn’t take any more...
Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.
You’re a long way from home...
The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
Lombard...  It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile I’d sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...
There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?
Did you not enter this country illegally?
Come on, Mr Lombard. You tailed your man all the way here from Europe. You told me you knew where to find him, remember? Or didn’t I hear you right?
A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think I’ll get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, it’ll be too late.
Then find another way.
Emily...
No. You’re looking at a real Musketeer here, Whitney. Brave and rash. Had to dash in there.  Take a prisoner... Might as well have sent them a notice to quit...  Come on, Musketeer! Got anything to say?
She’ll be alright. She’s tough...
Why?
What...?
Yes. Friedman’s the fuckin’ Austrian!
What kids?
I don’t know. I don’t know, man. I don’t even know Friedman that well... I...  Man, you’ve got to get me out of here...
What about the staff?  They’re in on what’s going on, aren’t they?  How many of them?
F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, I’ve got to get to...
Got it. Puppies.
No.
So you haven’t seen the film, then?
Oh no. I’m all right. He was a jerk, really. Another boy, you know? All I meet is boys. When I think of all the fuss about older men fancying young girls. I mean, is it true?
Well, I would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning, Mrs Spitz. I wouldn’t like to think I’d kept you waiting for nothing.
I said earlier that my husband and I are supporting Leonard in his photography, Mr Lombard. By this I mean that since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account.
Anything at all?
Right now your big friend at the Diplomat is bleeding fast, Martin. He might still possibly survive if attended to soon. And he did cooperate.
Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.
Look, I don’t think you’re fully aware of what you’re playing with here, Mister. Whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you. Why don’t you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner, eh?
No. In Hampstead... Why?
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
In my jacket. Left inside pocket.
What’s a French private investigator doing here?
They’re German Jews. Came here before the war. They both lost all their families in extermination camps, but they themselves never went near one. The idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting Leon. It’s not guilt, more of a curse...  And then there’s something about his parents being involved with Nazi hunters... But I think that’s just one of Leon’s dark delusions...
Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
How’s the boy doing?
Good. You needn’t worry about the Austrian anymore. He’s dead. I’ll be in touch.
Excuse me?
Oh. That’d be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...
Fucked-up fucking weird.
Tu sais où me trouver.
I don’t have your credentials, Nathalie.
If you can, send me a receipt.
So why didn’t he?
I think you’d rather not know what I think.
Some guy called to let him know the Frenchman who’d called the night before he left London was in L.A. looking to kill him. He did his sums and decided to take the call seriously.
They lost their son. Why?
Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, I’d watch my step. These people are well-connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The lady’s also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.
Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
My lord, I'm not sure that...
Jean, it's... it's not so easy...
Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God?  Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught.  Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no.  And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no.  Jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of God in all this?
Tremoille... don't.  Please...
The King of England.  I want to give them the chance to leave Orleans in peace before I get there.
I don't know it.  I feel it.
Tell me...
Tell the king to give me more men.
Jeanne... I have been hearing voices -- and believe me, those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to Compiegne!
Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...
... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...
What are you doing?  This is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this!
She's loyal to her king... it's only to be expected that she...
So long as this bitch remains alive, our armies refuse to fight!  Don't you understand?  They want proof that God is on their side... and the only way they're going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch!
No no, I'm fine, really...
Who are you?
I will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things, but as for my revelations, I've never told anyone except my king... Charles the Seventh... the one and only king of France.
I am sent by God, and I submit all my words and deeds to His judgment. Or do you think that you are better judges than He is?
You have nothing to regret...
He's feeling wonderful.
Don't look at the cost, look at what it brings.  What is your last offer?
Gave you?  Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that...
She says she'll be here tomorrow...!
What difference does it make where she comes from?
I can see her if I want to.  I mean, with half of France in the hands of the English, what have I got to lose?
The other half.
There's no time, sire -- we can't hold up the ceremony... there's no telling when the English might come back... they're only ten leagues away...
Noooo!
Is it long and hanging down?
You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!
That'll put fire in my soldiers!
Me too...
I don't think.  I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.
Never look behind -- only ahead!
Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers.
I... submit to Our Lord.
It seems to me that the Church and Our Lord are one and the same.  Why must you complicate what is so simple?
No...
No...!
Here -- take this instead.
Were the men confessed?  Where are the priests?
Don't swear...
My king.
As much as for a Lord?  What an honor!  Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?
I am that I am.  You don't like my face?  Maybe you prefer this one...
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
Why not?
God asked you to do something?
Oh no?  How about this one?
No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
What are you doing on the wall?
Are you going to leave me too?
Oh yes... very.
Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
Michal Dzikiewicz. He's my husband.
Doesn't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves? Where will we get them?
Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
What's happened?
What d'you mean, take the table away?
It certainly was.
A good place for what?  He's insane!
Three lousy zlotys. And there are people here making millions.
Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
Yes, but what good did it do?
No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.
Please, don't insult us.  Can you do something for him?
...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
You're a dirty pig!
Liar, you fell asleep. Pig!
I know. But last summer, I worked for a day in Zelazna Brama Square. I saw someone I knew. A singer. Her husband's an actor. They're old friends.  I've written their names down. And their address. If they're still there. Janina Godlewska and Andrzej Bogucki. Good people. Majorek, you go into the town every day. Would you try and make contact? Ask them if they'd help me get out of here?
Out of Warsaw. Where?
I was... I was trying to open this tin.
A pianist.
I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?
Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
It will be very dramatic.
Like it were a piano?
Baines is packing up?
Ohh the tag is broken.
And where did they get married?
The Alps.
No, no bible readers.
She's stunted, that's one thing.
Yes
No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it.
Well, thank you, I expect she will appreciate it.
No, but her words are in my head.  I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.
Let us not discuss this further. I am very pleased....
Hello.
Play a song then
Don't think so.  I know everybody in the place and I always bounce the lamsters.
Who told ya this guy was in here?
I don't have to.  You'll be bustin' in on the Chief of Police just up the hall. 
You got a bag or somethin?
I had some appointments.
How much did ya lose?
You're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp.  I didn't teach ya to be no pimp.
I think it's the best...
What?
What are you talkin' about?  We just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  We can do anything we want now.
It's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the Big Con. You're wastin' your time workin' street marks.
But you played the Big Con.  You said it was nothin'.  A game for flakes and mama's boys.
If that's the way you want it.
You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
Wasn't no problem a mine.
I don't look any good in clothes and I don't know how to drive. What else ya got to sell, Eirie?
Hackers.
Just give us what ya can, Benny. We'll send a truck down.
Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
I can talk, can't I?
Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric.  Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
You mean you blew it.
I picked something up on the way.
What do ya mean?
Did he say he wouldn't?
How many guys you conned in your life, Henry?
If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever.
We'll give him the hook on the train, and play him here.  You think I can get in that poker game, Eddie?
Raise 500.
The name is Lonnegan.
What for?  I haven't done anything.
But I got a train to make.
Think nothin' of it.
Where you goin'?
And you expect me to come over, just like that.
Tomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya.  And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.
Naw, he picked up some jane in the bar.  Can't see him till morning anyway.
That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
I am after this race.
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
I don't know, figure something out.
Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.
All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
There wasn't any way he coulda known we was in there.  We made a clean pick on the lock and didn't leave no footprints in the hall. Somebody musta wised him up.
Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?
This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
You know how they are... sex...
Then just say he was sixty years old.
Of course.
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.
Why did that man want to kill him?
You better take a drink.
Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?
Aren't you Nick Charles?
Yes.
Probably not.
Thanks.  We will.  Goodbye.
There. 
She fell down.
Which way did she fall?
I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
But it isn't bad weather now.
Not at all.
We were looking for this bird.
Keep on asking.
Yeah. Couldn't find a thing. This is the way we figure it.  Wynant goes to Julia's apartment. He finds Morelli there... sees she's two- timing him.  They have a fight. But he figures he don't want to do anything then.... Morelli might squeal.  So he goes away. He don't let his lawyer know anything has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to Julia to give to him, so that Julia will think it's all blown over. Then, when she don't expect it... he lets her have it.
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
He's holding out on you.
She's ready to talk.  It won't do any harm, though - to find out where he is.
Could this be him?
No.
He telephoned me today.
Yes.  But he didn't show up.
That's nothing.  I saw him myself.
Let him have his say out.
You don't think I had anything to do with it?
Just what I said I'd do.
Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
I can't! I haven't got it!
What did you do with the rest?
That's all right.
You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.
He sends word through Julia Wolf when he wants money...  I give it to her and she gives it to him.
So I did.  I saw him lying buried in his shop.
And the murderer is right here in this room tonight... he's sitting at this table.  You may serve the fish.
Macaulay, you drew up Wynant's will.  Mimi was cut off, wasn't she, if she re-married?
She don't say she is, but I figure she is -
Thank you.  Now I'll tell you why I know Wynant didn't commit those murders -  Three months ago - the night that he caught you in Julia's apartment, he found out that Julia was cheating him, and was splitting with some man.  He went to find the man. That man was.... Tanner, don't you...?
If you like 'em like that.
That last Martini.
Take it easy.
Rye.
There's one coming.
Who gave it to you?
Who's that?
I don't believe he did it.
We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?
You wouldn't be a widow long.
Nick, you'll drive me crazy.  What things?
What things made you so sure?
Got a nice evening dress?
That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
Trying to put it off on her?
No... no.
Bonds, sir?
I just wanted to tell you...
Home!
Turn the car around.
Wha...
This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.
Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
The soldiers are going to kill those people!
Got to be some kind of landmark; something distinctive.
Maybe I don't need your ideas.  Maybe I can do better on my own.
How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it.
You don't know he isn't.
Wes--
So you can give us away?
No you're not.
Another month in this desert and I might just.
There might be something in there.
Cool it, Jaeger.  Hey, Wes?  Wes?
And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
You know, you sound just like a boy who's never--
They're not going to--
Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy.  You're cool.
You can't tell anybody about this.
I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.
Just be cool.
How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
Why you got to move away to talk!?
Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet deal.
Shut up and listen!
I hope it means something, otherwise...
Stay low.
Where the hell is it!?
Yeah, Bwana, you got it.
Jesus, Jaeger.
There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
How!?
Wes is dead!
I don't want to die.
I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.
Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?
Thanks.
Threatened to blow my brains out?
I don't know.
We'll make up some kind of lie.  They won't find the gold.
Saddam's got a boil on his ass?
I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you.  But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
You really think there's a treasure inside?
This is so weird.  It's happening, but it's not.  It's like a TV show, and we're part of it.
I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
Yeah!  Gold!  How much?
A car is not just a car where I come from.  I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang--
We just about got killed.  You know what happened?  We just about got killed, and you want to go on?
You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
Guess we know what the next stop is.
Yeah, we're down.
Correct.  Origin?
Drug evasion with assorted perversions
You know I don't feel well.
I have to see SEN.  I've just been given a shift change.
I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.
Looks like food.
But it's so hopeless...you're so beautiful.
Promise...please don't THX leaves the room.
No....I though  I'm afraid.
But...you...
If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
We could leave, and live in the superstructure....
Don't let them separate us.
What are you talking about? When did you sleep last?  Do you know what your trouble is? You're blind.  You've been here so long you can't see what is happening.  We must unite.  We need unity.  We need action. ) We have come to a time when we must....
I wonder how far he went.  He's gathered invaluable information out there.
What?
No one could have imagined anything one-thousandth as fantastic as the sober facts uncovered by patient inquiry.  This world is in a state of static-mobility:  we are at the same time moving and standing still.
When?.....How?
But you can't...you.
Maternity ward, huhh!
No!....
...to me.  I think I'm dying.
There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-
Go ahead.
You the Bomb Squad?
When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?
I don't know. You tell me?
No, ninety-ninety percent of them are full of baloney. They're into the power trip, not the damage. What scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants, then disappear. The worst of the bunch, they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever... and they love the carnage.
Driving in circles, waiting for-
Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.
No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound...
Oh shit...
A bowling alley.
He's my brother...
I know. I warned them.
Stay here.
Take him!
Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
I don't know...
Take your time... one day at a time, kid...
You mean you just--? ... You keep a record of... matches?
In this crowd? It's gonna be Marlboros, Camels, and maybe a few Kools.
Report on the case so far.
My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
No.
And harems ... ?
Smart. London, eh?
I thought so.
Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy.  Beginnings are always difficult.
Um-hum. Very good. Excellent!
But please, Baron. We're not supposed to breathe a word of it. You won't tell anybody I told you?
You must be related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron--
No, to you--M'sieu <u>Monescu</u>.
Very well, m'sieu.
Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!
What is it?
The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby. But I don't think he saw me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank heaven! ... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia!
But you came. And you must forget everything--  except that you are here, Countess.
You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were an American.
No--proud. Very proud!
Five, seven, and nine--
Correct. Now the train leaves--
Well, we'll have to take what's here. A bird in hand is worth two in jail.
Thirty-five to the left--sixty- three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... Seventy-six, eighty-four, fifty-five--  What has she got that I haven't got?
Yes.
Then you go into the foyer.
Yes.
You like that statue?
Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.
That's what you need!
It <u>is</u> beautiful. But I got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so I gave it to my secretary.
Everything! ... Madame Colet, if I were your father--  which, fortunately, I am not--
Precisely.
So you think you can get me?
<u>I</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
<u>Adolph</u>?
To M'sieu Laval?
I know!
To me he seems rather nervous.
For all the really important things--
Oh, madame, you're just too sweet for words! 
It's hers, you schmuck.  Look, Rose, I... I don't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump off the Titanic when it's not sinking, and jumps back onto it when it is... we're not dealing with logic here, I know that... but please... think about this a second.
I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her.
Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?
The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!
Of course not. That's not the point.  Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!
I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.
What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me.
Could I speak to you in private?
Jack.
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
It is that simple.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely.
Right.
And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful.
It was a dreadful, heavy thing.  I only wore it this once.
Just tell us what you can --
It would be a nice change from you.
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
I like touching you--poison ivy.  You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?
I'm just commencing to enjoy this trip.
You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--  --and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.
If I ever won a pot that large the boat would sink. 
I'll bet a couple of hundred.
Oh, no--I played with <U>your</U> cards--in <U>your</U> cabin--at <U>your</U> suggestion--If you've got a kick coming, make it to the Purser.
Good-by!
You're not very ambitious, are you?
Aw--give a feller a break. My cards are on the table-- I want to know you. How about dining with me tonight?
--you want to adopt him!--Good for you!
I must say you're persistent--  --it's kind of flattering.
Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
Who with?
We coulda got two third-class!
No bank roll there, boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
A thousand? She's one in a million--right off the top of the rosebush!
You know where that sense of humor's goin' to get you one of these days--
I'll take one. 
Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
You keep out of this--  You admit you thought of killing him--how were you going to do it?
I'm sorry to hear that.
I would--but our rehearsal starts right away.  Before I go I want to ask you a little favor. Sally is an important part of my show. Some day--not now--when you get a chance--let her come to just one rehearsal. I'll appreciate it.
Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but <U>that</U> would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd just like to live <U>my</U> life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin <U>hers</U>--Do I make myself clear?
That's right. I owe you a dollar sixty.
Fine! Instead of saying "next month"--we'll use one word and say "June."
Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
I can see you're no gentleman--
Yes--Me--in person!
I was never stiffer in my life.
It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
Oh no--I don't want to impose on you--  It's funny about that billfold--I could have sworn I had it- 
Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee wouldn't stand for it and--well--here I am!
I don't get the humor of that remark.
Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
Meaning what?
Put the whole thing in an envelope and mail it through a porthole--
Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
So what?
I wish I could.
He's all right.
I wouldn't say that--  I'm glad he's dead--yes--I'd thought of killing him-- but I didn't--
Why?
Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.
Telegrams.
Hey--you! Where you going?
500? Sly boots, must be a peach of a hand.
Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right?
Oh, so that's it...
I saw that look pass between you And Wyatt at the fight.  Listen to Me!  You're mine!  Understand? You're my woman and I'm your man.
Look kid, I know what it's like, I was a kid, too.  Even stole a Horse once.  But you can't--
Well now that's a little more Like it.
Make you a deal.  My brother took Over the Marshal's office in Tombstone.  Got it in his head He's gonna make the place safe For widows and orphans.  You and Your boys stay out of his way, I'll make sure he stays out of yours.
We're gonna get along just fine.
I know.  Just did what you had to. That banner and stuff, that's Just Ike.  Don't worry about it.
I said forget it, answer's no, I Don't want the job and that's Final.  I'm going to Tombstone and Nothin' short of dyin's gonn Stop me.  Good day.
I see, off to strike it rich, Huh.  All right, fine, wish you Luck.  Tell you this though, never Was a rich man yet didn't wind up With a guilty conscience.
Already got a guilty conscience, Might as well have the money too.
Say when.
Bless you, darling  Darling!  Are you mad?  You're not Wearing a bustle.  How lewd!
Enough?  Never.
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house.
I see.  And what would you do if "she" walked in her right now? WYATT "She"?
But Doc-
Don't touch me, God damn it!  Just Don't touch me!  Come on...
Then what do I do?
Then why in hell're you doin' This?  You ought to be in bed.
Damn!  All right, wait a minute...
No.
Yeah.  Or undertakers.
I know what it means.
You know you almost got us both Killed back there?
Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored.  That blonde Woman, is that your wife?
Room service.
The way you talk.  Never heard a Woman talk like that.
Well you're different, no arguing That.  But you're a lady all right. I'll take my oath on it.
Getting late.  We better get back.
Look, it's too much of a tangle. I already cast my lot.  I can't go Back and I can't sneak, feel back Enough as it is.
Well sure, neighbor, easy to say.
Don't worry, Doc, it's not your problem. You don't have to mix up in this.
Yeah, well, I swore a lot of things.
I need it.
'Least you admit it.
You know nothing.  What you don't Know would fill a book.  Jesus, I Feel like it's when you're around I need it most.  You're never Yourself, you never relax.  Never. Everything's so stiff and dead. You always have to keep a rein on Everything, ever yourself.  Oh, You smile sometimes, I've even Seen you laugh.  But there's no Light in your smile for me, Wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. And I get cold, Wyatt.  I get so cold.  What's between you and that Jew woman?
You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother.  Come back, no hard Feelings.
You're the boss.  One thing, though.
All right, run 'em off.
But this time they'll be ready.
Listen to yourself, Wyatt.  Lie Down and crawl or you might get Hurt?  What kinda talk is that? That's Virgil lyin' over there, Wyatt.  Our own brother.  Ruined For life.  No sir, I ain't going No place.  You want to go, fine. I'm stayin' right here and have It out with those bastards.
Isn't true.  I can't see a damn thing.
Business is business.  Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not If there's money in it.
Just stay calm, use your head. It'll be all right.  Just the Same, though...  Guess you better swear me in.
All right, Virge, your call.  But Give Doc the shotgun.  They'll be Less apt to get nervy if they see Him on the street howitzer.
Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son.  Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.
A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton.  It's deadlier than uranium.
We'll see about that.
Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?
I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.
Four o'clock. Don't be late.
No, 007. It's just that I've learned from personal experience - that when we get what we want -  Somehow the reality is never as... Satisfying as the fantasy.
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
Big game fishing.  Sonar torpedoes. Retirement gift from his friends at the CIA.
Not from forty feet.
Does it work on cash machines?
Have we met?
Let's not make it a habit.
- You're not.
...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
Actually, you're just in time.  Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander Bond, don't you?
What do you make of all this?
It doesn't quite add up.
Sabotage?
I was just getting to the interesting part!
Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.
I was an attorney!
The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -
Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations
No -
Good. We have an appointment in Hong Kong.
Yes. Shall we kill them?
Yes, sir. But he still feels his people should share in the increased profits of our news division. He has proposed an additional 500 million dollar payment.
Thank you sir! Thank you!
I don't know. He's not in the database -
Maybe. Maybe not.
Since when?
This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.
I told her I would if she would give me time.
You always got the best of it around here and when Dad always talks about my son, it is always you, so you fix the roof.
Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.
I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property.
Like muddy waters?
Do you think you won?
I'm going back home with Harry.
I don't know what happened to him. He just ran out into the streets.  I got some old records I want you to hear. I like the blues sung simply, man and a guitar. Or sung by a woman who had bad luck all her life. Don't ever let anyone tell you his life's story if it is of a weary life full of sadness. When I was a boy, a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and I'll be damned if the same thing didn't happen to me.
I heard his voice as clear as day. I better get back. Maybe something is wrong.
This would be a bad time for me to leave.
We are going where the action is. Ain't that right, Okra?  Let's play for a couple of bucks unless you want to start off with two bits and work our way up.  What would you give to be rich?
We grow most of our own food. The money I get from social security, my pension and my wife's work, keeps us living on the edge. What choice do people like us have.
I don't know how two brothers can be so different.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
How is the garden doing?
Gal, you're talking to John Henry. When was I sick?
I don't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. You're being irreverent.
I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
Well if you're sure, I won't be a bother. Oh, I don't sleep on no spring mattress. I always make myself a pallet on the floor.
I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner, but time got away.
I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.
I'll be right there.
He wasn't able to get out of bed today.
Only if you can spare it.
You invited me.
Wasn't Hocker lynched?
Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
Speaking of tappy heads, we ought to have an old fashion fish fry.
He should be caring. That is not too much to ask.
Rush your mouth, girl. No, he didn't. He cannot be that big of a damn fool.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.
I want to hear what happened. My brother is a jackass and a damn fool. The both of you have been as scarce as hen's teeth.
Counting the what? What does that have to do with the price of butter?
I planted a row just for you and you don't owe me anything.
Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!
Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!
Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
Let's let Molly open one.
Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!
You mean that happy child?
Trouble?!  Where?!
Down there.  Just down there.  A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!
Oh.  Oh, that's good.
But we're not on my planet, are we?
This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
Don't tell me what to do!
No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.
The match!
Ha ha!!  To Infinity and Beyond!!
Miss.  G-6.
Patient is...  ...pre-e-epped.
Have you been replaced?
Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear?  Now I'm curious.  What does a Space Ranger actually do?
I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
All right, that's enough.  Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy --
Alright!  That's it!
Nothing.
No, no, no, wait!
Woody?  Who's up there with you?
Yes SIR!
It's busted.
Sh-h-h-h-h!!
Uh-h-h-h...nothing!  Uh, nothing. I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all.  Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose.  It's just a mistake.
Slink!  Hang on!
Excuse me.
I carried you up to your bed.
Can you move over a wee bit?
In my pocket.
What? Did you let that child play with one of my toys? I don't like children playing with my toys.  Have to fix you up with another hammer, won't we. Give her a saucepan to play with, that'll do.
Well, I hope it stays that way.
Well, you know, he's going to say about Madrigal... and Salazar.
Why are you talking like that?
I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.
That is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us.
To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.
I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space --
He's a friend.  He's also like the only one who was dealing with the situation.  He'd definitely had a few beers, but it's not like he wanted to drive.  We didn't know what else to do.  It wasn't my pot.
What's up?
How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl.
Yes.
I get A's.  All A's.
I'm a National Merit Finalist.  I'm on the Hi-Q team and the Math team. I'm in the Spanish Club.  I'm a Thespian.  I'm Vice-President of my class.  I'm on the volleyball team.
What is this, like freebase?
Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
Yes, mom --
Nope.
It's a funny fuckin' joke and it's quick.  Why do women wear makeup and perfume?
She ain't in on it.
So does half of San Diego.
I love my job.  I love it.  The next time I'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I'll get over it.
Depends on the state.
We're playing!
You may speak.
The amount of coke we got on you means capital punishment in some states.
We can protect you.
In Mexico law enforcement is an entrepreneurial activity, this is not so true for the USA.  Using regression analysis we made a study of the customs lanes at the border and calculated the odds of a search.  The odds are not high, and we found variables that reduce the odds.  We hire drivers with nothing to lose.  Then we throw a lot of product at the problem.  Some get stopped.  Enough get through.  It's not difficult.
When the DEA gets into the narcotics business, then we'll stay at the Four Seasons.
You're breaking my heart.
I don't believe you.
I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
Anyway, I don't think we'll ever see them again.  Everything's back to normal.
Then I guess I'm going by myself.
We agree.
Well, Javier Rodriguez, you've done a very good job, but we'll take care of it from here.
But will he be house-trained?
Is it possible to have a Drug Czar in Mexico who isn't connected in some war to one of the cartels?
The worst serial killer in history - who?  Gacy - right?  Killed forty two people.  Our government killed fifty thousand in Vietnam and lied about it every day.
She hasn't called you?
We sometimes went downtown to score.
Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand?  What is your policy for treating addiction?
I don't know.  I don't think there's any one person.  See the problem is the Juarez cartel owns everything and everybody, all the property on the Mexican side, sometimes all the property on both sides.  Warehouses, transportation, even tunnels.  It's very organized.
I'm sorry.
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
Aye, OK, Fr.  But the good times couldn't last for ever.
Too right it is. Now look, have you got anything to eat, 'cos I'm fucking Lee Marvin, by the way.
I'd fucking kill you.
Eh-
Come on.
Easy for you to say.
No.
What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?
Eh? How's that?
Of course, the motto, the motto --
Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world.
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
No.
Following the game at all?
Have you got any gear on you?
Well, sub us, then, mate. I'm expecting a rent cheque.
No problem.  No problem -- easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite for blood.
Exactly.
Some of his solo stuff's not bad.
I'm cooking' up. There is a silence.
You know.
No, he didn't make me touch it.
Oh no, don't even mention it.
He made me lick it.
Well, Christ, if I'd known you were going to get so humpty about it, I wouldn't have bothered. Are you going to eat that?
To see you through the night that lies ahead.
Look, Tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off Lizzy, but there's no need to take it out on us.
Six weeks.
Yes, but then she finds out I've bought a ticket for Iggy Pop the same night.
No. Well, yes. I have to admit it: I'm a perfectionist. For me, it's the best or nothing at all. If things go badly, I can't be bothered, but I have a good feeling about this interview. Seems to me like it's gone pretty well. We've touched on a lot of subjects, a lot of things to think about, for all of us.
You doubt me?
The ship....
Bring it closer so that I might join with it. Do it, or watch these puny things die horribly.
My pain?
Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
Aye, Captain  How many times do I have to tell you? The right tool for the right job...
The knowledge and experience he sought were forbidden by Vulcan belief.
Be one with the horse.
Yes, Captain.
I ordered you to defend this ship.
No, no, no, Captain. You do not understand. Sybok also in a son of Sarek.
This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.
How do you know?
Hmmm?
To anyone within the sound of my voice: This is Captain James T. Kirk of the Federation Starship Enterprise. If you read me, acknowledge. Acknowledge.
Mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge.
No conditions.
Because you, too, must know.

"Let's see what she's got," said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?
Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
You know I'm right.
I know you better than that.
I don't understand...
Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.
Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access...
Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...
You call that getting over it?
I mean I want both of us to go.
For being on to Dillinger.
Boy, I sit up there grindin' away all day, and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun.
No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!
It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.
There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
All that is visible must grow beyond itself and extend into the realm of the invisible.
No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...
The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?
You're alive!
I'm sorry, Tron... he's... he didn't make it.
Not with this disk. I'm going to check on the beam connection, Yori. You two can keep a watch out for grid bugs.
Aah, I'm fine... little hung over is all...
A little ...  Over there, the Mountains of Data... and I think that's the Silicon Valley...
You're a..."guest" of the Master Control Program. They're going to make you play video games.
Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of stuff. Like...my User wants me to go after the MCP
Strategic Air Command.
It's a flat. But wait a micro...
As long as it gets us out of here
It's something Users do.
No you're not.  You're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake!
Mom, wake up!  Dad barely knows we exist.
It is true!  He doesn't know anything about me.  He still thinks I'm like ten years old or something.  As long as I just smile and say yes to whatever he says, like his good little fantasy daughter, he thinks everything's fine.  But it's not fine.  Nothing's fine.
You know you can always talk to me.  Right?  Whatever is going on in your life, your mom and I'll understand.
Okay, Dad.
Why?  So I can wind up like you? What's the point?
Roger, One.  Rolling.
What?
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
No way.  Not Dana.
Albert Gibson.  Three four nine nine one.
Stay on him.
That's it.  Get 'im Harry  We'll teach that little puke not to signal.
She's having an affair.
Oh shit.  Harry... what're you doing?
... the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius.  Anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately--
You're not going anywhere.
I'd like that.
And you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants.
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
I don't know anything about a faction.  I just met Simon...  or whatever his name is...  a couple of weeks ago.  I barely know him.
No.
What did you need?
No.
Answer the question--
Yes or no.
Don't call me honey!  You don't ever get to call me honey again. You understand?!  You pig!
It makes you tell the truth?
Yes.
Are we going to die?
You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?
Wait!  You got the wrong guy.  My name's Simon.  Look, just let me go.  There's no need to kill me. I haven't seen your--
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
Helen?  It's Simon.  Is it safe to talk?
Cairo was a day at the beach next				* to this.
You can trust me completely.
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.
Find out who this Renquist it.
Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.
He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over.
Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R.
Is that your real name? Really?
Sure. Why not?
What time is it?
I'd love some pie.
I don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black.
What's your favorite movie star?
Would you like a bite of my pie?
Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.
Well, we sell other things too. Cool stuff. "Man from U.N.C.L.E." Lunch boxes. "Green Hornet" board games. Shit like that. But comic books are main business. There's a lot of collectors around here.
You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.
She OD'd, didn't she?
Who and what is a Drexl?
Uh-huh.
What did he do to Arlene?
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes...
I just gotta get somethin'.
Write down Drexl's address.
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
You don't know me. Not when it comes to shit like this. I have to do this. I need for you to know you can count on me to protect you. Now write down the address.
Is this a joke?
Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.
What?
You ain't kiddin', we got lives to start over, we should go somewhere where we can really start from scatch.
So you do eat pussy!
Naw naw!
Yeah.
If I thought I could get away with it -
Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.
It'll get ya high.
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a fuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he deserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit badge or somethin'.
Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp -
This is our last chance to play "what if". I want to do it. I'm just scared of getting caught.
Really?
A Donny Chiba triple feature. "The Streetfighter", "Return of the Streetfighter", and "Sister Streetfighter".
Want an animal cracker?
What do you think, eightball?
No. No you're not.
No. Not yet.
You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong.
I can see what you mean.
The biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a lot of film. A man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that. And Lee, you're no idiot.
I don't think that'll be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you be nice and get coffee for everybody.
Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.  Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.  He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.
I bullshitted him.
She seems very nice.
What makes you think I could do that?
No shit?
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
I got some money I can give you -
I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go?
Sure. No problem.
Absolutely.
Do you believe him?
No don't sit here and feed us some shit.
Or a bit player -
You're an actor, so act, motherfucker.
I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
I'm not wearing a bra.
No.
Exactly room-mates.
Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?
Shut your mouth. Nick Cardella was provin' what his words was worth before you were in your daddy's nutsack. What sun do you walk under you can throw a shadow on Nick Cardella? Nick Cardella's a stand-up guy.
Donowitz, he said.
I think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street.
Forced you!  Why would someone force you to take drugs?
Meaning...???
No.
A jail?  Prison?
What year is it?
You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?
Ohhhh, that one!  Can we hear that one?
And I was in it?  What did I do?
I just have to locate the virus in its original form before it mutates.  So scientists can come back and study it and find a cure.  So that those of us who survived can go back to the surface of the earth.
I'm not going to "do" anything, I promise.  But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is.
You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey Mason, don't you, James?  You met him in the County Hospital six years ago.
It was some kind of...war.  Never mind, you wouldn't believe me.  Turn off here.
No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
Yeah, sort of, I guess.  I...I'm sorry I locked you up.  I thought...I thought... I think maybe I am crazy!
First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?
No, I want to turn myself in.  Where is he?  Don't worry -- it's all okay now.  I'm not crazy any more!  I mean, I am crazy, mentally divergent, actually, but I know it now and I want you to help me.  I want to get well...
I thought I was in...prison again.
Just like that?  You were in prison?
James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number!  You tried to call and...
I'll get the tickets and meet you... in the Gift Shop.
If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
I've managed to contact certain underlings, evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and assorted minions, who will contact my father. When he learns I'm in this kind of place, he'll have them transfer me to one of those classy joints where they treat you...properly. LIKE A GUEST!  LIKE A PERSON!  SHEETS! TOWELS!  LIKE A BIG HOTEL WITH GREAT DRUGS FOR THE NUT CASE LUNATIC MANIAC DEVILS...
You do know me.  You helped me once.
The call I just made?  Five minutes ago?
They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?
You see what I mean?  You're being defensive.  Isn't she being defensive, Bob?
You're insane, Jeffrey.
That woman is...was...your... psychiatrist?  And now she's spray- painting our building?
Then how come she knows what's going on?
James Cole.  That's everything we got.  None of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing. You want me to go in with you?
Twelve Monkeys, honey.  Guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning.
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
I think I've heard that before.
That's 'cause I've done a lot of living.
You're a hell of a pessimist, old man.
You want to make a kiddies bet?
Next city you're in take it to a jeweler.  He won't give you less than four-hundred for it.
But, in particular?
How much.
The ticket is thirty dollars.
But he's dead.
Look, pal, I've got places to be. Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
What time is it now?
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
Don't look like nothing.
Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
She's all yours. Put a new hose in it, and she runs like a dream now.
Well . . . parts, labor . . . let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
To replace a God damn radiator hose!?
That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.
You've been there?
Two-hundred.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
I'm taking my car, and I'm taking it now!
We're closed.  Come back in the morning.
Kirin?
Genuine Draft?
No.  We got Miller.  Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?
Yes.  Yes it is.
Sheriff Potter.
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
What happened to your hand?
I . . . can't . . . argue . . .
You're welcome, Grace.
All over.  Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.
Where you headed?
Where'd you learn to do that?
Like they're made of polyester.
Whatever it takes.
How much money has he got?
We'd have to kill him.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
What about us?
Are you sure?  About me, I mean?
No.
Where are you going?
Give him the money.
I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
What for?
I was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up.
Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
Someone will find me.
I'm her husband.
I guess we've never been introduced proper.  Jake McKenna.
Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara.
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him.
Like you don't know.
Talk?  About what?
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
How do you put a price on murder?
How much could you get?
The sooner it's over, the sooner you're on your way.  Now listen to me:  It's got to look like an accident; that's the thing.  If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
You're out in the desert, the middle of nowhere with no one around for miles, and you say the time wasn't right?  What's the matter?  You were hoping to get it on home video?  A keepsake for the grandkids.  Thank God I waited, or I never would have gotten it on tape.
You know what I mean.
I know all right.  I know you're just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a man's wife.  You've probably bagged a few at that. You'd probably lie, cheat and steal without thinking twice.  From that you'd just turn and walk away.  But to kill; to get that blood on your hands.  You can't wash that off. You'd be a marked man for life. Just like Cain.  And you're a sinner who wants to walk with the saints. Ain't that right, boy?
Came close this time and it scares you.
Darrell giving you problems?
You thought you'd come in here in the middle of the night and wham! Wail off and clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper.
Jake--
Yeah, well, a couple of hours ago I just about killed some guy over a girl.  Not for money, for a girl. And she was just going to stand there and let it happen, or let him kill me.  Same way Grace played us this morning.  I don't like that, Jake.  Not twice in one day.  And maybe I'm so pissed I'd twist the next off my own Grandma to get out of here.
What are you . . . you can't . . . you can't kill me.
I don't blame you.  What man would? I admit it, okay?  I came back here and I made it with Grace.  But if you kill me you're making a big mistake.
Will you shut up!
Stand up.
Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?
You don't know the how, Mr. Vesci. And that's not the half of it.  I've got your money, and I go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.
Let me guess.  This robber; he gets your money.
Maybe not for you, Sheriff, but I think I've had my fill of your little town.
What for?
Thirty-thousand dollars.
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...I miss him.  I'll see ya later, unless I come across something worse.
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
...And everything is nothing too.
So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
More or less.
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
Make time?  Is everybody in this town on drugs?
Give it to me!
This means something to you?  Jenny means something to me.
Wait a second--
This is a joke, right?  You just want to rattle me.  Right?
I did?
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
No, I hate loving her. I hate the kind of person she is. I hate having to tolerate the little "games" she plays. Like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me. The bitch. She loved to play. She wants me to hit her and when I hit her she likes it. She tortures me. But she's family. She's my little girl. My baby. I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull. No. Not me. But you? You got the killing in you, boy...How much you want?
No!
Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two-hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There won't be enough left for an autopsy.  But I need the the money.  I've got to have the money.
What are you talking about!
What?
No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for ... Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you?
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
OK. Darrell... Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
I'll be back in a couple of hours.  And be careful with her, will you?
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket.  That's going to run you another fifty.
We're closed.  Come back when the sun comes up.
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
Figgers. There's a scratch on the hood and how much you make selling my gun? Deduct it.
No! No police.
I'm just going to my car?
May I carry your package, Grace?
All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.
I pack up and go somewhere else.
From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.
Like you.
Guys like me take those chances. Let's go.
I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway. I mean, I would ... do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said: You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
There is no us, remember?
I could if I had Jake's money.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
I don't know about that?
You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.
We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
I busted my leg!
Can you make it back up?
Sounds like it. I wish I could help Sheriff, but I just want to get my car and get on up the road.
A hundred and ... Now you listen to me you deadbeat little punk:  I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller.  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and <u>I want it</u>.  I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is.
But, in particular?
One way, or round trip?
No Beck's. A-1, Coors...
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
Well it's about time. Looks like you found yourself a helper too.
You sound just like Jake... I did see into the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it. Go back to your family. They love you.
Wrong number.
You didn't hear something?
Like you helped her, Jake?
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking.
No sir he is not.  I read about you in the paper.
Four.
I know.
Okay.
Oh shit...
Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal.
Not often, but it is possible. Most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits. They don't know how long the shadow really is. They don't know how far away the real limits are standing... They stop out of fear.
Jesus.
As a color, not as rust. You know, a rust colored paint or wood?
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
My turn.  When was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it?
I don't know Megan.
We're not proceeding anywhere together.
You could have poured coffee in Starbucks, you could have learned to install track lighting in office buildings, you could have told people their horoscopes on the internet... You could have been one of ten thousand things... but in the end, you chose to protect people. You made that decision... and I find that very, very interesting.  Now all I need is your credit card number.
Telling when people have done something wrong?
One last question.
I'm very proud of him.  He's been through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. A couple I'd thought had broken him... I mean emotionally.  They were bad... But he made it. Yes he did.
I think it's be better if I was alone.
Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great.
Jeremy.  I'm going in. I have to do some things.
I lied.
Get mom.
I'm not scared.
Do you know why?
It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.
Is that right?
How long have you been married?
You can't do anything about that. You might fall between that chair and this television. If that's what God has planned for you, that's what's going to happen. You can't hide from it in your room.
Where is it?
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
You told them cowboys you had it.
What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.
Just wondered. Anybody could be scared.
Scouting?
Your wife?
Yeah, I guess.
Alive?
Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. We come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an'...
Property.
Yup.
Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
I... I guess I might... but like I said, I ain't armed.
Duke.
Huh? Oh.  Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.
Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
He's... he's dead.
A sign on him?
Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
If you was to change your mind, might be you could catch me... due West to the Western Trail an' North to Ogallala.
Huh?
Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
Yup.
You can shoot him.
How I said I shot five men... it wasn't true.  That Mexican... the one that come at me with a knife... I busted his leg with a shovel... I didn't shoot him or nothin'.
Well, I gu-guess they had it... comin'.
Sure. Sure, Bill.
Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
You ain't shot.
Huh?
Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans.  Bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... I could see shootin' 'em...
She gave me the evil eye.
Well, she...
You was a... a crazy sonofabitch.
Yeah.
Naw. I bumped my head fallin' off of my horse.
Who, Bill? Who got snake eyes?
Two more hogs got the fever.
Three.
Tom? Only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week...  how we was to take half the money to Sally an' say you was...
All that money... I mean... did you...?
Who said that?
Naw, son, I didn't kill nobody.
You gonna share your half with him?
We don't need him. The two of us could do it.
All of it. About him, an' you an' Uncle Pete... about robbin' the Rock Island Pacific... an' about them Missouri Banks.
Time for what, Edie? Time to look into me a little more, that's what. No matter how well you cover my tracks now, they'll find out who I am.
Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with explosives. Mean as a snake when it mattered .
I can run. I got no problem with that.
I walked. Ninety days, suspended.
They're gonna do a job. Three million dollars, maybe more.
Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.
I want you to find Edie. Both of you find some place safe. Tell her what happened - Everything. She knows people. She'll know what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way.
Mr. So- My employer has made up his mind. He does not change it.
Neither do we.
Waste of time.
I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead.
I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
No.
He loved her.
You got him wrong.
NOT FROM ME, YOU PIECE OF SHIT. THERE IS NO IMMUNITY FROM ME. You atone with me or the world you live in becomes the hell you fear in the back of your tiny mind. Every criminal I have put in prison,
Keaton always said: &quot;I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him.&quot; Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser SOZE.
Gee, thanks, Dave. Bang-up job so far. Extortion, coercion. You'll pardon me if I ask you to kiss my pucker. The same fuckers that rounded us up and sank us into this mess are telling me They'll bail me out? Fuck you. You think you can catch Keyser Soze? You think a guy like that comes this close to getting fingered and sticks his head out? If he comes up for anything, it will be to get rid of me.  After that, my guess is you'll never hear from him again.
This is totally irrelevant.
Give a guy a break, huh?
I don't.
Because he was my friend.
NO.
May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
Very good.
How did you settle on the amount?
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
...to save her and to save the baby.  Is that...
`Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.'  Yes.
I am seventy-four years old.
Sir.  Yes.  When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available.  I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.  I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
Huh!
Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
Yes.
Now.  I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
I understand.    I went to the Bar Association.  They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
It's a common medical term.
I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
...I made a reservation at...
...apartment.   No, no. Please.  You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
...What difference would...
I'm afraid that's not true.   Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
And you wrote that...
... and you're going to do that?
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
Why is that?
I was held up.
That's perfectly all right.
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar.  Representing my client. My client, do you understand?  You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
Overruled...
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
Pardon?
I changed my life today.  What did you do?
No, no, I'm just...
You're going to stay here...?
You're talking like a drunk.
You told me so.  Maybe you'd get some sympathy.  You came to the wrong place.
Oh, yes, I do, Joe.  Believe me. You say you're going to lose.  Is it my fault?  Listen!  The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
Fuck you.  I got a call today from Sally Doneghy ...
... You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them ...
... hey, I don't need your charity ...
That's the point, you stupid fuck. Let them buy it.  We let them buy the case.  That's what I took it for.  You let this drop -- we'll go up to New Hampshire, kill some fuckin' deer...
Right.
You got a good memory, Franky.
Yeah.
That's right.
Who?  They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
And did you write the numeral `one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
...of the procedures...
But those notations stop...  ...four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
We, we were rather busy...
Me, too.
No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background.
Almost a year.
And you like it.
No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. It just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark. But --  -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town.
I'm not making it up. I wouldn't know how. She'll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don't know. I call to her and she doesn't hear. And then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and doesn't know she's been away... can't tell me where... or why...
Where'd she go?
Why did she never tell her daughter?
I'm not going to hurt you! I promise! Please!
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
Dinner... and what else?
Just dinner.
An hour?
Don't go.
I'll take care of you.
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
No, Judy, you don't understand.
No.
Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the made-to-order witness. Where is he now?
We'll find him.
Why?
When?
I enjoyed talking to you.
Good-bye.
How can you be sure?
I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!
A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
How do you know?
Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!
And it's a all real.
Where?
Madeleine --
Madeleine!!
Please answer my question.
No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
What car?
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!
Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --
Think?  Well, what do you think?
All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
Excellent.
Sorry Fish.
She's dead.
Why was the floor wet?
Why?!
You have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems.
Go home!
You go home!
You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries.
Why?
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?
Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows.
The reality is, you take away the horror of this situation, take away the tragedy of the death, take away the moral and ethical implications of all the crap you have had conditioned, beaten, into your head since grade one. What are we left with? What? A 115 lb. problem. 115 lbs. that must be moved from point A to point B. Now, a straight line in the shortest distance but we are denied the luxury of a visible straight line. But that line exists and I see it.I see that line. Trust me. Adam. Trust me...I can take care of this.
We've already done this.
They're on me. They're smoking me out!
I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
They're screaming for Starbursts.
Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father.
No. I think it's fucked.
Y'see? That's the real point here. That's what I'm driving for, when the big storm comes and knocks down all the forests and the rocks fall down and the leave's are bare. What's left? The little trees, the little fellas that the storm didn't see. The tiny little...
What.
Don't sweet lip me.
Nothing happened in Vegas.
We can take her out to Red Rock. Find some quiet place...and put her in the ground.
Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...
I can't.
I'm talking about prayer.
Boyd...What have we done?
What did you ask me?
I said, what have we done?
Just do it.
What does that mean?
What does that mean?
Now?
Okay fine.
I'm serious.
You have a King fantasy.
Photographer?
Why what?
You can't play around with these tent people.
Don't you dare.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else.
What does Moore have to do with your growing?
I've known him since Cub Scouts.
He's quiet.
You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on "Oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.
Time out.
It's vile!
I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.
I'm not. What's the problem?
We're leaving in three hours.
Take care of those chairs.
What are you doing?
I'm mad at you.
Where are you?
Okay.
What okay?
The chairs.
No baby. We'll all be right in.
I know.
I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
You fucked a prostitute?
No buts. I've waited twenty-seven years, twenty-seven years I have focused and prepared to walk down that aisle. I will not be derailed! I will not be embarrassed! I will not be denied! I am walking down that aisle tomorrow come hell or high fucking water!
I love you so much it hurts. Me and your mother marvel at what you have become. You're going to have a wonderful journey with this girl. I feel it deep inside. A wonderful, magical journey.  And I'm, like I said, just so proud of how you turned out.  You go out and knock 'em dead Keith. Knock'em dead!
What does that mean?
Lately I'll just start getting lightheaded, dizzy, and I realize I haven't breathed in like two minutes.
Go for it.
I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...
I've been looking for that flash and I look and I look and I can't find it. And what if I already had it? You know. My moment? What if it's gone? And I never saw it?  You're getting married, man. That's a fucking beautiful thing. Just a beautiful thing. I just can't stop breaking beautiful things.
Did she believe you?
That's what I'm thinking.
I kind of like "till death do us part." I mean, this is forever. In sickness and in health, through good times and bad. Honey, what do you think?
The post-Vegas Man.
We will.
Well, I just need your signature on these contracts and a deposit check so I can get the ball rolling.
I said out of respect. Respect for you Fisher. For you and your wedding and your beautiful bride. There will be no more rain. You see where I am here?
No, the children sleep with me.
Then it's a respectable house.
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
Wasn't that cowardice?
No, it's true.  Last night when you were sleeping, I had you all to myself.
I have asked her but she's ungrateful. Sometimes I feel like hitting her. When I talk to her about the convent, she turns to stone.
Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
She won't even know.
Do you have great devotion for the Virgin?
Thank you; but it's missing something.
One shouldn't be alone the whole time.  I'm not like him, am I?
These chairs are in good condition. With a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable.
Well... is it so urgent?
I know perfectly well how little I can do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.
Why not?
Yes -- very, very big!
I have a headache.
It's very wicked to spy. Why did you do it?
If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
Real, my ass. It's an overblown game.  Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?
None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
I don't set policy.  You have the key?
Got it.
You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to.
I know.  I'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile. If you want to experience the future, meet me in my office in 15 minutes. And bring the Sheila 3.2 character module with you...
What's wrong with Parker?
Think hard -- it'll come to you...
You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!
Help me get out of here.
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
I know who would know.
Who said that?
He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite.
What does that mean?
You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're re—adapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant...
I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
This is my area of expertise.
Enjoying yourself?
Tell him.
Think he's keeping track of his creation?
More or less.
Lindenmeyer?
My guess is dead.
Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
I must make them very nervous if they let you out of prison.  You know, we have so much in common —— we have such history together ——I've been thinking we should become friends.
As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
...on the way in.
<u>Hello</u>.  What?

All Combat takes place at night, in the Rain, and at the Junction of four Map Segments...
I was acting as a Private Citizen.  Nothing that I've done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe I am connected with.  Or in whose <u>employ</u>...
Well, let's not be too sure, why is that?
Yeah, I need a list, people in Military Special Pro...
Whaddaya think?
Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you.
S'only got to hold for another few days.
Well, I'm not interested in how long its "got to hold for."
To preserve their Way of Life.
Uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u>, uh...  You're kidding.
I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me?

Is he dead?
Uh huh...why?
Finish Strong!  Are you <u>nuts</u>?  Are you nuts?  This's Pennies from <u>Heaven</u>... on his triumphal return home, Old Shoe, his Plane Forced Down...AND YET...
We'll deal with that when we come to it.  <u>This</u> is producing.  <u>This</u> is what they pay off on...come on, Pal, Boots and Saddles...
He's doped to the <u>Gills</u> ...
...one more day.
A proud tradition.
Take ten.
He ain't seen <u>nothin'</u> yet.
It can't be a ribbon cause AIDS had a ribbon, cause the Yellow Ribbon thing had a ribbon, cause...
Better.
Surest thing you know.
Well, there's a lot to be said for that.  And I'm going to show a clip.  You've seen it before, you've seen it <u>many</u> times...  But I'm going to ask you to look at it once more.  With the election one day off, and the President's standing in the polls...
...their Leopard Skin Berets....
Hey, <u>you're</u> getting the big bucks....  I think we're up-and-running...

Susie?  Susie.  Are you alright...?  <u>Susie</u>...
Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!
...light snack, but good, thanks pal, you're sharking your way up...
Thanks, Marv, with that I might be able to qualify for welfare.
Yeah, but he didn't see me.
That's right, next time a little birdie talks to you, talk to me too E.F. Hutton.
Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here?
D.K. -- didn't know -- who I was when the options he bought took a bath. He reneged on me.
It's Queens, Dad and a 5% mortgage and you rent the top room--I gotta live in Manhattan to be a player, Dad. There's no nobility in poverty anymore, y'know. One day you're going to be proud of me, you'll see... 
How's Mom?
About what?
They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
Nah, she asked the wrong question.
....Relax Roget  You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...
I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...
So what firm you with, pal?
Excuse me sir.
The most valuable commodity I know of is information. Wouldn't you agree on that?
'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
I don't understand.
Don't expect to get it all, sport, you'll burn out. First rule of business is never get emotional about stock, clouds the judgment. Where do we stand?
...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.
Allright. Wait here...
You're learning, sport...
...Gordon.
I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.
Sure. What's worth doing is worth doing for money. It's a bad bargain where nobody gains. And if this deal goes through, we all gain.
Upper West Side.
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
I don't.
That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...
So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy?
Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.
Get the hell out!
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.
Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
You got it, G.G.
Yeah 
A body.  I mean we're talking major body
Ok toots, I will.
Thank you Jenkins
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
Thank you
Tony and China?
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
Big deal!
Right behind you.
This. is killer.
Well divide 18 into three
Six six and six
Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
Oh! The virgin has spoken! SARAH Stop it!
Never fear, Tony is here.  Ladies first.
Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
No, he wouldn't.
Yes it is.  Can we please not do that? Please?  Cause it is.
Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
Then why did you?
You're joking.
Well, that's what we're here for.
Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
I don't know, I'm very confused right now.
Have you been hurt?
At the party.
Toward the end.  You remember?
Who's that?
And I'm afraid.  Oh god, I'm so afraid of...
That's not...It's not like that.
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
I couldn't catch my breath.  That's not a metaphor, that's...And I panicked.  I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there...  I tried to leave him.  Went to my mother's in Boston.  He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home.
Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
Of course.
Thanks, but I'm fine.
...no...no...no...
Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
It's alright.
Then what was it?
Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you.
No.
You don't know that.  If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow you have to break the connection.
Did he say that?
Three weeks.
You are...
I know.
Yup.
Tomorrow.
Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can--
Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.
What kind of whispering?
Huh.
What?
What am I looking at?
Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?
Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under some strain.  But there's no such thing as ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed?
Dressed?
Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...
Yes.  And he's going to get away with it.
Sabotage?
But then you've been so much better...
I...
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
What's wrong with me?
Of course she did, Norman.  What else could it be?
What?
How can you be sure?
Don't think so.
I know.
Then what is he...?
With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.
You sound certifiable. Yon know that.
NO!  she's pregnant, Aaron.  she's got that to deal with - and the clinic.. she is not to hear about this.   don't you think I know she spends half her lite worrying about me...  Listening to my heart, aren't you...?  The Timex still ticking...?
"Go back, Michael.  Do what you can..."
Every day  twice.
He chose ME for ROWAN --- when I was a child!
You have to warn her - this second! I'm catching the next flight back!
I don't want it.
It was quite warranted by the - situation.    I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great -
A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.     Have your lawyer -
You're a monster.
Stop it!
I'll tell OR we're bringing -
There are things you will not tell him.
Explain this to me --- violated...?
You bastard...
There was no thought.  There was no act.    That is not what I am.
I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
As far as touching things, yes. But the vision - that keeps pouring into my head-    It won't go away God - if I could just understand it.
You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
I'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you.
Ms. yin, and Mr. yang  Aha!
Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
Stop it.
What about you coming down here...?
I am!   And so are you.  You thought you'd found yourself a nice, sensible doctor. pause)  Michael, if you don't want -
And I thought I was the mindreader.
That's not funny.
No.
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
A person could get killed round here just for working late
No -it's no problem - I do it all the time
Yes, two please. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry, it's just that I really loved your book
What's with all the locks - and hammering
Yes, one and a half please.
I don't know
I don't know
I don't want to talk about it -
My wife  My wife was the only one who really deserved it.  LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she mothered me...
Why should I?
Then make it stop...
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now...
I am ashamed of what I have done ELLEN. When I read what you had written it made me think - look into myself - I haven't dared look into myself for a long time - I have stopped ELLEN, I can't carry on - I won't carry on. All I want is to start a new life - I want a second chance...You are good to me - you don't condescend, you're intelligent, and very beautiful...
But for how long - what will set you off again? You'll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a white hat - and that will be it - back on the merry go round...
No thanks - 
At 2.00...
I would prefer it if you kept away from LESLIE
As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?
Surgery? Are you a doctor?
I'd really like it if you would come round some time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say...
Yes - of course.
Yes - one please.
Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
Nobody knows about your mental retardation.
And nobody knows you're a virgin!  Aw, who are we kidding...
What is it now?
Dead?
I'd feel like staying up all night! Forever! Or at least till I got the LAY of the land, SO TO SPEAK.
...where they get all the really good porno channels on cable.
And while you're at it, I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads.
I love those springy head puppies!
Next time, make sure you put a barf bag in the centerfold.
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
From your lips, to God's ears.
They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy.
I will not have my boys arguing.
And who IS Ted Nelson?
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
You mean they knew who I was?
Are they hitting you up for donations? Asking you to sponsor the local quilting bee?
My new bike.
I came to ask permission to take custody of your room.
You can have it, then. I'm not going back there.
Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.
Look, I loved "Exposed!" and I hate it that you got busted. I know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not THAT BAD.
It was for your own good, in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way.
I'm trying to help.
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
I don't get the distinction.
Interesting.
Is this an gritty exposé or a candy ass press release?
Undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort.
I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
I know.
You think you're working with chimps here?
But how would we pay our bills?
You're free.  You can do anything you ever wanted to do!
Don't say "shit," honey. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms.
No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.
What kind of ideas?
You think we should be more open minded?
The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.
I can't wait to see the pictures.
Seriously? I'm doing all right?
All is fair in "Heaven," Ted-baby.
I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?
I'd like that.
Could be hers.  Types match.  Could be a lot of other people's too...
Then I guess Walter can kiss that arm of his goodbye.  He don't use it for no good deeds anyway.
Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean that's how it sounded in my head.  He hurt me...
That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine.  But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt.  Was this the first time a man was inside you?
I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
Try, Kelly.
Still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her.  I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt?
All I'm saying is, we let Sandra Van Ryan push us too hard, we're going to wind up looking stupid.
It's a shithole.  But she was dirty, what was I gonna do?
Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
You got it.  The rich got richer.  While the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp.
The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there.  But he's made a mistake.
Did he come in with you?
I think she's acting.  I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  I think maybe she's upset that he didn't...
Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
Get off this Ray, now.  If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide.  You get an ID, you call me.
You didn't cuff her?
And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?
Your Honor... Please...
You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?
Whichever one I want.
You know what it takes.
Then do it.  I need you on this Kelly. Do it tonight.  We'll figure something out... Okay?
You think that's wise?
Um-huh.  And guess what else?  I have toys.
Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...
I did.  At Blue Balls.
So Suzie, you called us, remember?
That's right.  That was his name.
And she wanted to talk.
Sit down, Lombardo.
Hi, Sandy.
So maybe I'm a one-woman man.
Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer.
Funny.  So am I.
All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
Starting with a screw?
My disguise.  And here...
That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested.
Which is why we're heading to Houston, Texas.  Home of the Loveless Steam Engine Works.
Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
Yes.  And a much nicer one than ours.
Your guests, ma'am?
Fine, I'll stop.
Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
Nice to finally meet you, sir.
I deal with some tough customers.
"Emperor Miguelito...?"
Easy?  Easy?  On just what grounds should I take it easy!?
We'll explain on the way.
For the moment.  But I fear not for long.  I'm of no use to him now.
It is?
Gimme a sword, Airk.  I'll win your war for you.
Then come with us.
Just get me some horses.
She belongs to all of us.  She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth.
Me?
Too bad you're not more like your father.
Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good hands.  You haven't made a mistake.
The Fairy Queen?  And the baby here's a princess?  And these two rodents are your guides?
I won't.
Willow!
Well what did she say?
She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
Ahhh!
Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby.  It looks like a daikini...
We must start with feathers, dung, and a lock of your hair.
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
John, I don't understand any of this.
I won't. Now run.  Fast as you can!
Amish.
Yeah.
Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight – street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
So one of them got to him.
Maybe.
You're still convinced there's a link to the department?
The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.
I would not be too sure.
Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows.
No, no doctor...
You tell him. When you're able.
I know what he said.
We had some lemonade and he left.
Now hold on. There's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job.
I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus' tea.
Johnny! Where the hell have you been?
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
I'm coming.
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
You're the first one he'll contact.
He's got my number.
I don't know where he is.
Yes.
You didn't have to...
Looks dead...
That is idle talk.
You are acting like one!
You might have killed him!
Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
The Wizard - The Wizard - The Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz - Oz - Oz-Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz!
This?
Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!
Oh!
Oh, please give me back my dog!
No!  Fool, that I am!  I should have remembered -- those slippers will never come off, as long as...
Oh!  Well....
Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
Why --
Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?
Aw, come, come, come --
Oh --
I said it had poppies on the wall paper! Eh -- she's -- What's this?  Why, she's -- she's putting her hand on her heart -- she's -- she's dropping down on the....
Oh, no -- no!
But you couldn't have been, could you?
Oh! Oh!
Oh --  Goodbye, Lion.  You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage.
Yeh, it's sad, believe me, Missy When you're born to be a sissy, Without the vim and verve. But I could show my prowess -- Be a lion not a mou-ess -- If I only had the nerve I'm afraid there's no denyin' I'm just a dande-lion -- A fate I don't deserve. I'd be brave as a blizzard --
And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
Stay with us, then, Dorothy.  We all love you.  We don't want you to go.
It's pleasant down that way, too.
Ohh!
Where's Kansas?
That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
You're going to see a Wizard?
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
Oh --
Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
Oh, no -- please.  I have to rest for just a minute.  Toto!
Somebody pulled my tail.
I -- Oh --
And you're going to lead us.
Now...
It's a whatzis?
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
I want to see you and your wife right away....
Ohhhh -- it's me!
No, sir!
Let's.
Yes.
Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
Well, that's you all over.
But how can we find her? We don't even know where she is. Look! There's....
Oh --
Well, I --
Don’t know any doctor jokes.
Elektra King.
Like riding a bike.
So isn’t it time you unwrapped your present?
Well, at least it turned out to have some purpose.
Which is neutral, no doubt.
Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.
I haven’t been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
Partially, yes.
It’s the only way out...
You had your chance, James. Now I’m looking for a bigger thrill.
I don’t know what you’re talking about!
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
You, of course. I need some information.
Where did you get this?
Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.
She’s no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didn’t even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.
What do you think?
It’s heading for the oil terminal.
They want in.  Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.
Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?
Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.
Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
What is it?  How does it work?
And what if you¹re wrong?
What if you¹re wrong??
Then I¹ve been a very bad boy and you¹ll have to spank me.  Christ!  I¹m doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
You're sure?
With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.
-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
Yes you are.
I think he's going to the john.
What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
Where did he go?
What new information?
Coward.  Giving up.
I don't know their real names.
Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.
I'm sorry about Blake.
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
What is that ungodly smell?
Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
Come on, Gibbons, you can do better then that.
Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. When it settles down to Earth, it'll kill everything in the vicinity.
Somebody else makes those decisions, not guys like you and me. You've done your job, X, head back to Prague. I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This is my operation now.
I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
What weapons do you have?
Like what?
He gets to be the hero.
Go to hell.
Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type.
That makes two of us then, sweetheart, because I ain't buying your bullshit either. You're not like them, I can see it in your eyes. So you tell me, who's bullshitting who?
Go to hell!
Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.
A beach named X? That I'd like to see.
Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.
Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.
Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?
A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.
Let's do this.
Go to the water, it's that way!
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.
Alright, so I'll get more.
You're serious?
You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.
The corner. Anarchy 99.
Had to do what I had to do.
You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man.
Easy. You get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss.
Sure, if that's what you want. Why not? It's all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it.
I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.
No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
He calls me sport one more time, and I'll blow a watermelon-sized hole through him.
You know, you --
Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
INTENTION?  Intention, Senator?  We are talking about mankind here.  His fear.  It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps.  Studied for weaknesses.  And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth.
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
If she held on any longer she could have.
A piece.  Only a piece.
Oh, shit.
MMmmm.
Yes.
Yes.
Very....very!
Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
I hope you like large weddings.
Surprised!
I suppose you're right.
I'll have to think it over.  It's not so easy just to pick up and...
Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
Saturday night, yes, sir.  Have a pleasant journey!
I beg your pardon?
A piece of what?
How old are you, young man?
It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
Yes, just the two.
I wonder what's got into them?
Did you hear that strange music?
What?
How?
I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?
Why?
You've got it, master.
Well, I don't like to see you mope.
You can say that again.
You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
That sound good, boss.
I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?
It's the only way.
How's everything?
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
...Su-per du-per. Come let's mix where Rock- e-fellers walk with sticks or 'um-ber- el-las' in their mitts.........................
Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
Well, this explains the music.
And look at this, Doctor!
A god?
I thought it was wonderful.
What do you think we should do?
This is not the finals -- just sing!
It's some-thing dar-ing, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal,' A way of danc-ing that's real-ly ul-tra new; It's ver-y sub-tle, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal.'
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
Good!  It shouldn't take more than a few seconds.
Good night!
Why don't we talk inside?
Yes, I know.
Whew!  A nineteen-inch drill.
Three minutes to go!
Do you have a reservation?
I listened extra careful to your "Stand To" this mornin', Boy. ft was peifecL I couldn't 've done it better meseif, not even when I was Bugler to The Duke Of Wellington.. .now tell me, where did you get that black eye?
Could be.  Across the river into Zululand. . They might just be waiting there for us to show up... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies!....
You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster?
Do not confuse yourse{fi Why? We must strike a heavy blow. This cannot be a war of manoeuvre.
Intelligence? Sources of your own? Did it not occur to you they may be native rumours? Rumours to draw you off- to leave the whole ofNatal open to a possible counter thrust
I think Chelmsford wants a good man on the border Why he fears a flanking attack and requires a steady Commander in reserve.
