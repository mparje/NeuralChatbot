Cameron.
Let me see what I can do.
Well, there's someone I think might be --
Where?
You might wanna think about it
Hi, Joey.
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
What's normal?
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
Because she'll scare them away.
Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
How many people go here?
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
He always have that shit-eating grin?
He seems like he thrives on danger
Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
Not at all
Your sister here?
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
You need money to take a girl out
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
Fifty, and you've got your man.
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
Are you lost?
Who cares?
My mission in life.
I say, do what you wanna do.
Maybe.
This.
No offense, but you're sister is without.  I know everyone likes her and all, but ...
Acting the way we do.
Yes
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
Then you screwed up
Hearsay.
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
No one else knows
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Answer the question, Patrick
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
Why can't we agree on this?
I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Parts of it.
What's to discuss?
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
I am, Your Eminence
Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
Are we going to argue?
I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
I am afraid this is not the worst news.
This time with me!
There must be a passage to that other ocean.
Then you are too ambitious.
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Thousands.
Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
So was Christ!
Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
Give me absolution.
No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
We came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days!  So we will be brave and swallow our grief.  And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.
And what do you think Mendez?
You must be mad...!
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
You bloody...
I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  I'm coming with him.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
No.  No way.
Your mother was blind?
I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
What about back home?
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
I'll get my clothes.
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?
Who do you think, Chief?!
No!  Nothing happened.
Vodka tonic.
It's okay.
I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
You're Polish?
My folks are.
Stay here.
So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
Is that all there is?
Yeah.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
Alright.
I'm not.
Could be Leon's.
I love you.
Don't be late.
Yeah.  And he still went to the party.
Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.
Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
Look.  Do we have a problem here? There's no reason to have a problem. I'm gonna make you feel real good.  You wanna Czech girl? After I'm done with you, you won't miss her.  Now why don't you pay me?
Is there a problem?
In here, says he wants a million.
I want to document my trip to America.
This way.  Hold it this way.  Good.
Be quiet.  Watch.
Milos.  Get my money!
Ha. Ha.
You've got a call.
You want the tape?  There it is!
I want to hear everything he said.
I'm trying to tell you.
New York.
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.
Maybe you can be his stand-in.
Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
How did they manage to do that without any communication?
It's about my salary cheques.
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
Yes, I thought so.
I guess it isn't.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
No.
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
Yes, it is.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
Yes, it's coming along very well.
Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
Any clue as to what it is?
True.
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.
I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is.  I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will.  He owes me money...
No chance.
Didn't work out that way.  He busted out with a big Indian. They capped two guards on a road gang. Nice meeting you Reggie.
Shit.  I'm already sorry.
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
Thank you.
Want to try it again?
What are you talkin' about?
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
They saved your ass, convict.
One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
How much?
Jesus.
He's after your money.
You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?
Not likely, convict.
Yeah.  Right.
...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
Yeah, too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
Jack?
I'll keep it in mind.
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
You're hopeless.
That's the way I see it, too.
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
Hey, you know what I really think?
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
Just a second, that's all!
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
Dallas. Korben Dallas.
Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?
...So Cornelius was telling the truth!
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer your cat to the real thing.
I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
Time is of no importance, only life is important.
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
Uh... not really.
To save the world.
And the third one?
You're the only one left alive...
You have won the annual Gemini contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two. Congratulations. Here are your tickets.
Why not?
Oh, yes you will...
I suppose that means "Hi" ?
Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!
You noticed..
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
I told you not to read all that crap!
I'm so tired...
...Like love...
But I don't know love... I'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.
Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!
What you are saying is you don't know what this..thing..is.
Yes, Sir!
Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
How's our deal coming along?
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
I love you.
Sure.  I'll call the guy.
I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
I'm not gonna need it.  I won't even wear it.  It's a precaution.  Don't worry about me.
You couldn't?
I don't know what to say
Amy...
What?
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
What can I do for you today?
I'll consider it.
If it's not him, there's no deal.
Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
Yeah, who's this?
Who is this.
What the fuck are you.. ?
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
How much did he pay you?
It was a lot of fucking money.
Something like that.
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
Stop talking.
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
What do you want?  You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?
Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.
That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
They're no friends of mine.
I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
Good for you.
Three, four years.
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
Four hundred a week, off the books.
Interesting theory.
I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
He's a lawyer.  Please, sit, here...
I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
That's exactly what I am.
Why do you think he did it?
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
Of course.
What?
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
None too discreet, is he?
No, you may not.
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
What?
Yeah, I'm not so sure.
Sounds like a game show host to me.
Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.
Save it for later.  Come on!
You just stay put.  You need rest.
My name is...
How did you know that?
My friend, with the funny hand.
Alice...
Now.
Had kind of a long night.
Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.
I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??
Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
Nobody thinks that.
My baby!
Yeah...
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
But if they <u>do</u>?
So they caught up with you, too?
Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
Listen!  Hear that?
You know - it <u>is</u>?
What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
We hope!
Wonderful!
High-intensity arcs will burn, submerged.  And millions of volts...discharged in random directions...
I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
But - what can we accomplish?
It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
Minus three.
Come where?
I'll be another!
Toward the Pole!
No. Black.
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
Tell me.
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
Ruined my arm. Brought me along too fast. Why'd it have to be my fucking arm, I used to think. Then I realized it had to be somebody's fucking arm.
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
No, I mean whereabouts.
What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man.
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
Do what?
You know.
Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.
But it's not funny now.
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
It's not that.
Okay.
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
You don't want the extra police pay?
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
So?
Mel Gordon.
I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
Okay.
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
You get the hell out of my house now, asshole. And know this -- you are going to be a lucky asshole if I haven't got you fired before the day is out. I can do it with one phone call, and I'm pissed enough to do it now!
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
Marg! You got orders!
Crawl!
Wade?
Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
Well, it was an accident.
Yeah, I guess.
Get some sleep.
Well, do you still plan to get married?
Then who shot him?
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
A hunting accident is perfect.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
Got it.
Stay cool.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
That's game, set, and match. There's nothing to do, except call the Chief Justice.
A secret service agent. It must be.
Well it worked.
We're not going to make it.
Copy, Air Force One.
Thank you.
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
I know he left you behind.
How can you? I mean they're people.
Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
That isn't necessary.
Rose, I don't have time for this.
She's a big girl.  She understands.
We're under attack.
Where's my family?
Yeah, right.
No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?
Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?
Sir...
A MiG? Where the hell are we?
Twenty-five years.
They better. Fuel's almost gone.
I just wish it was that simple.
Felt like a large asteroid.
I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.
Ask Simon.
If that's the way you want it.
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
What word would you use, Elaine?
That's right -- premature ejection.
The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...
Simon.
No, I've been excited before.
Simon, why has he become so... so...
I think so.
Yes, sir.
That's not possible.
We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.
It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with.
Sixteen 'C', why?
He's carrying a bomb.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
Don't try to stop me!
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
That's a lovely name. Mine's Milton...Milt Ettenhenim. But my friends call me 'Bubbles.'
I can't tell.
That's right.
Well...
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past!
Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?
It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before.
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
Good-bye, darling.
Here.
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my buns every night.
Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
Huh?
All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
A virgin.  I find that very arousing...
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
I like my horizons narrow.
Yeah...
That's right.
Show me.
Sergeant... Detective.  I wasn't aware there were any Newcomers at the rank of Detective yet.
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
Nothing?
How the hell do you know that?
Did you learn anything?
Back off, George.
Stay back!  I'm okay.
From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.
In the camps, we were lodged four to a room.  The selection process was entirely random.  We did not get to stay with our friends... or families...
Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked.
And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.
Thank you.
We all did.
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
Ss-ai!
What is it?
Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
That's all I know.  You want anything more, you ask somebody else.
Yeah... he was one Martin Helder. White male, twenty-seven.  Let's see... wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction, a couple for sale of a controlled substance. Oh yeah, and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock.
Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.
That's the way these people are. You don't hit both pumps you just piss them off.
You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
You?
What?
Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
Talk to me, Hudson.
Yes.  That follows.
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours.  The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers.  About equal to ten megatons.
You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
If I go.
That's the plan.  My word on it.
We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?
Sure, Hicks.
Are you finished?  You okay?
That's right.  So we put up welded barricades at these intersections...  ...and seal these ducts here and here.  Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here.
Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
No.  Have you?
Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?
You don't have to be sorry.  It wasn't your fault.
I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
Gone.
Wah...?  Where are...?
Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in trouble.
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
Right here, baby.  Right here.
Yes, honey.  I think we both can.
What do you mean?
Where?
A brothel.
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
What?
Don't bother.
Is her mother still lying on the floor?
But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
You have leave to try.
Humiliated?
I want to go!
Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
Eat my - ah!
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
Well, don't do that again!
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
He's not Herr Mozart. Call him Papa.
What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
I don't know.
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
Oh, Stanzi.
You'd think I was mad.
Why?
He's terribly busy, sir.
Really?
Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
Alone.
He asked me to stay.
Leave him alone!
I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
Well, this is none of your business.  Whoever sent you is going to pay, no?
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
May I try it?
Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
Well. There it is.
No, no, please! It is not a holy relic.  You know we have met already? In this very room. Perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old.  He was giving the most brilliant little concert here. As he got off the stool, he slipped and fell. My sister Antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he did? Jumped straight into her arms and said, Will you marry me, yes or no?
Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.
Thank you, Sire!
What is it?
Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
It couldn't be better.
Oh, let's not talk about it.
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
What medicine?
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
Sublime! Utterly sublime!
Animals?
So there you are. What do you say?
Wolfi!
Put it down!
What?
So let me see it. Where is it?
How could I not?
It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.
Of course not.
Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
You burned the score?
But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
Did my work please you?
I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
No, please.
I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.
Are you ill?
I'm too young to be so sick.
You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
Do you believe in it?
What?
With the tenors.
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
Yes.
I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
Must I? Well, I won't! I tell you straight: I will not!
Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
In the sight of God that is a sin.
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
Leave me alone.
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
Are they?
Ah - you've heard that?
The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands.
My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
You must be mad.
About the ballet.
Oh yes, yes. And that was?
What do you mean - now?
Can we come in?
Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!
What exactly did he call out?
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
What shall we do?
It was a wolf.
How is that?
I dream of death mostly.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
That's not really a very proper question.
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
Good. I thought for a moment I was the only embarrassed one in the room.
Your dead friend Jack?
I was awake and he was in my room.
But, David.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
Okay.
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
Don't you remember?
David, let's go now.
No!
Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
I was having a nightmare.
What time is it?
An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
Lunatic?
Good.
You're not having a good time are you?
Right.
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
She says she 'likes me too much'.
David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
Shall we?
Nice to see you.
I have no idea.
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
Plan?
Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
Get out of here, Jack!
Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
Hello.
Gerald is the man you murdered in the subway. We thought it best you didn't see him as he's a fresh kill and still pretty messy.
How shall I do it?
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
Campari and soda would do nicely.
Sorry, love.
Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
We'll find him, not to worry.
Yeah - sure!
No kidding?
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
Yeah.
Yeah.
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city. We're fools to tolerate it.
Take it easy, Clark.
Not at all. That's Alexander Hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. Those are his exact words, gentlemen. Character!  It's the only thing you can bank on, and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums.
I have everything I own in it. It's your bank as well as mine, isn't it?
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
We can take blood from anything   If it's comin' to us.
know, but
But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
Why, I needed a
Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .
Now let me see, what comes next?  Oh yes, I know - what are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
Why, Cyril, you're insane
What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?
Let me see your cash book, will you?
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
Got a handkerchief?
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Hello, Helen.
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
Why, I don't know.
Yes, sir.
Were you in Cluett's apartment?
If he can do it, yes.
No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
We haven't much on hand, you know. If it gets any worse, I hope we don't have to close the doors.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. But soon as our money runs out, they'll mob the place.
Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.
Is it safe?
It's his life insurance money, you know.
Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
Matt, come here!
Why?
Oh, is that so?
Well . . . ?
Oh now, don't be silly.
He was in the bank yesterday.
Are you sure?
Never mind all that. What did you find out?
It was late, I know. The Dooley sisters was already in. They work at a show, you know.
There you are!
Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?
You used to carry a gun, didn't you?
Yes.
Yes.
Charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. He's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
You stay out of this, Bob.
How?
I ain't done --
Stop by our spread after that, tell our Ma we're all right. We'll go to Doc Mimms.
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
How?
In case we have to kill these sonofabitches, I don't want them to see us coming.
She was European!
It was exciting.
Yeah.
Yep.
What will be?
Then let me run the show, General Lee.
Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
Both would be nice.
Get buckets!
Strategically.
Of course!  Uh, sir?
All right, all right.  Jesse James never yelled at folk...
The District Marshall
Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.
Ho-yah!
On account of we're robbing it.
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
So?
Pff. He jumped his horse clear over our heads, killed a dozen Union soldiers before they knew what hit them.
Go home, Doc.  They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys.
Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
I reckoned.
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
What do you think?
We're gonna have to talk...
And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives.
What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.
Oh yeah.
Just do me a favor. Think about what this is costing everybody. Not just the railroad.
Yeah Jimmy?
Where will you find such a girl?
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
Oh, I'm not finished.  "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple."  As I said. Hmm.
Stop it. This is just sad.
If you don't see it, it's not real...
Yes ma'am.
You are a hell of a woman.
You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?
This time we'll make an exception.
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
Move you fools!
Really!
Good.
Yes sir.
How much did they get from the safe?
Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --
Sir?
What, sir?
It's going to be a long winter.
Why, their intense hatred of you, of course.
Nice?
Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?
Is that Donald Trump's car?
Oh God, just get it over with.
Maybe.
Really?
Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.
Yes, darling?
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
But what about the past? Our past?
No, you...didn't?
What?
Patrick, I think he knows you're here. It's only ten-thirty.
Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want. Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.
Interesting.
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
Patrick? Is that you?
Why?
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?
Understandable.  Lime?
Thanks.
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
Where did Paul hang out?
Well, maybe he did, huh?
I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
That's so typical, isn't it?
Nothing.
The earth just opens up and swallows people. 
Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman.
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
And?
Where was Marcus?
Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later.  I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?
You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.
Yes, it is.
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
We're not gonna let it.
You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting.
Milo. Why would he --
Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --
...Whaddo I do?
...Why?
After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
Poor baby. You know that's not true.
...Different?
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
Yes sir.
Yeah? I wanna feel like I did when I wrote that. But I'm 42, that's 100 in cyber-years. I look at you and see the things that got me here.  But somehow got away.
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
Well -- you sent for me.
Were the flags for Teddy?
34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way.
Gary?
Let's get him in here.
I'm calling Gary.
Where we going?
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN.  "GE joins Outpost in new venture," which means NBC is out. "Disney joins Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em.  It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in!
What'd he say?
"A beautiful geek? What're the chances?"
Thank God.
It's three years old, it --
But you said the other --
What?
Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five!
What does that mean?
I didn't plan this.
Well, he micro-managed the company till it got too big...  'Guess he needs to micro-manage something.
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come in, and I'll show you everything you need to know.
Smashing!
I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.
Be careful.
Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.
What's the other thing you're scared of?
What?
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
Yes, Basil?
I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.
Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
My mother's doing quite well, thank you very much.
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
I think I'll give that stew a ding-a- ling.
Why?
Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
No, this is me in a nutshell.
Oh, yes you are.
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
Who?
No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
Not now, Austin.
Kiss me.
Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
Shut up.
You've all been gathered here to form my Evil Cabinet. Excuse me.
Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!
I like to see girls of that caliber. By caliber, I mean both the barrel size of their guns and the high quality of their character... Forget it.
Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
Right.
Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.
We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
Yeah. What?
No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
No, Scott. You just don't get it, do you?
Scott, don't say that...
Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.
Great.
You didn't...
What about his teeth?
Well, it's kind of weird.
OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
No need. I'll call again.
Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...
Have we met?
You mean you don't recall??
Eh? In here!
If nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects. Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. A true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass.
Rules are made to be broken.
Let me guess -- 'Father'?
We want to help...!
So am I.
Next assignment?
But -- why?
The result would be ...
1922. Why the kippers?
Rules are made to be broken.
I had a feeling you would. Touche!
After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?
The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
I might say the same.
Frankly that's how I remember it.
Is there anything that isn't?
The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
But if someone miniaturized the process...
Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...
You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't you?
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
I thought you didn't.
Winning isn't everything.
I equivocated. But you're not their big worry at present. It's Dr. Darling:  he's disappeared ...
You'll find out.
Have a look at this.
Still a bit chilly ...
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
Pity your mother came, too ...
You're saying I have no choice.
It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated.  Wait here.
Peter's brother?  But --
Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
I fail to see --
Well, I can't possibly go like this.
You're not venturing alone, surely.
Amnesia?
I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
She was ...
But did they teach you this?
Did I? My mistake.
Debbie's marrying Rick.
I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.
Great. I'll go with you. Wait a second. Hey, Raul! Move that car, will you?
Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
I'm marrying Debbie.
He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
See that down there? That's my most prized possession. My new Porsche.
So does Debbie.
Yes I did.
Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
But how can I do that?
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
I can't sleep.
C'mon, I knew it was you.
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
Ilene, Rick promised...
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.
Well... hope she'll be very happy.
Gary, you're quite an animal.
This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
Good.
Right.
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
It's Bullwinkle.
What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later.
You can tell a man by his friends.
The phone made me do it!
Then there is a God. Why don't we take that baby picture.
The best table in the house.
So long, Father.
I don't know.
And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...
I'll stop him... You stall him.
Debbie.
Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
My Lt. might have something to say about that.
That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me!
Just come down, John. Just --
I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?
Hey! You don't know me --
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
This?
Listen to it, Brian... Jump when I say... It won't get us.
Saw what?
-- What are you doing here?
So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --
So now you suddenly care about my future?
How's it going?
I quit two days ago, Brian.
What'll you do?
It's a small town.
So you came to me...  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all...
Good. -- So our two heroes, Adcox and McCaffrey, they go back inside. Only there's another fire in there nobody sees. And it took your dad, didn't it Brian? Did you see him burn?
After it took your dad... the fire... did it look at you Brian? Did it talk to you?...
No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
But the right guess on this is arson.
I don't guess.
But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.
No. Do that and I guarantee you'll scare him off. I don't want him running away.
Nice bunch of guys.
You look like... Brian.
It isn't mine.  Let's get a picture.
Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?
Coffee sucked.
I was ahead of my time.
I'll be there.
He's going to be a fireman.
I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --
Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
He's out.
I know he's out, but how's he doing?
Yeah? When was the last time?
In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
There's something else kinda interesting...
You like everybody, Ronald.
-- Burn it all.
You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
Fuck you.  Just give me back a little something for the road.
Me?
I forgive you.
All right. What are you gonna do?
Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!
There's just no way the Mets will lose this game. Gooden is pitching and Strawberry is ready to break out.
That's my problem. Just put in my bet.
Don't bullshit me.
Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
You've really got a problem.
You knew them?  Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew?
I'm gonna start a chant and I want y'all to follow me.  Let's make our own 2 real coons know you're ready to start the show.
YEAH!
BIG BLACK is the first name and AFRICA is the last.
What's your name?
Ladies and gentlemen, there is no need to go there.  We can all agree to disagree without making threats.
Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.
We're starving.
That's right.  Money turns the wheel.
You have to start getting into your character.
How you sound?
I won't do it anymore.
No costume.  No blackface.
Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.
No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
Are these our two stars, sitting here in front of my nose?  Which one is Mantan again?
Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.
Besides, what does he know about Negroes?
No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director.  You can have that.
This has to be a big mistake.
I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped.
Nuthin' I can't handle.
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
Baby, you treat me so good. Peerless, you're a good son, I love you.  You never gave me no trouble.
Do you know how you will use him?
Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.
You getting cold feet?
Good.  I'm going to need your support.
Fuck da money.  Why do through all this effort?  Why?  Are you looking for love from Dunwitty?  For respect?  Dunwitty and his likes don't give a goddamn about you.  So now what are you gonna do?
Break a leg.
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
Thanks.
Is that good or bad?
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
How so?
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
Light?
Oh, is that what I'm doing?
Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
I don't believe it.
I will.  And good luck with your show.  I hope it's a huge success. You've worked very hard.  You deserve it.
I'll be right over.
I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
You know how your Daddy is.
You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
Ahhh!!!  I never heard of that term before.  I thought you were BLACK of African-American.  No?
Thank you for correcting my ignorance.  I'm looking forward to working side by side with you.  I feel we make a good team.
This is a TV show, not a music video.
Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
I envy you.  That's the way I want to feel about my work.
Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
And this is my very best friend Mantan.
Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.
Tomorrow is her birthday and I want to get her something really nice, like a...
...I heard different, thought that was...
...too early...
...too late, maybe around...
That's what I like about you and me. We git along...
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
My people love me.
And?
You can go now.
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.
Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word.
I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
We must write to her today, and you can tell her that you are safe and married to "Brown Bess."
Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.
I have heard of them.
Tut, tut!  I can play at fencing as well as you, Mr. Roderick James. Ah!  You change color, do you?  Your secret is known, is it?  You come like a viper into the bosom of innocent families; you represent yourself as the heir to my friends the O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins; I introduce you to the nobility and gentry of this methropolis; I take you to my tradesmen, who give you credit.  I accept your note for near two hundred pounds, and what do I find?  A fraud.
I don't know.
I have said all there is to be said. I am at your disposal for whatever purposes you wish.  Good night.
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
Who else can give me information about you?
Only the agency of servants.
I believe they will deport you.
Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.
Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.
With a woman who is completely charming, be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition, and who, regardless of her rank, will show me some kindness, tonight.
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.
O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.
All the same, you must name an amount.
It is entirely up to you.  I want the best.
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.
Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?
I see.
Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
Sir, let those laugh that win.
I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
He is only curious to know who you are.
Tender Hegenheim.
Who?
We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.
I just don't like it.
Okay.
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this -- I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die.
Yeah. Spent half his time in the infirmary. Only reason he enlisted was his father. West didn't section him till last week.
One went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him -- I thought you knew this --
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
The rest of you, fallout for physicals!
Your weapons, Sergeant.
Bullshit.
Why?
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
Mr. Hardy?
Huh. You know, I really thought you said Nunez. I thought you said "Dunbar was gone," My fault, I gotta check the tape on that.  Oh, yeah we taped the last interview. This one too. Cause it'd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie.
But you can't prove it! You can't prove anything until we find the bodies!
Where are they!
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
Not for me.
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
Or what? You've gone round the bend --
We're in the middle of a murder case --
Best time for banal chit-chat.
Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out.
You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
I lied. Wait for it...
I don't know.
Dunbar.
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.
Seven.
Really.
Far as I'm concerned, whatever you did in the past can stay in the past.
I don't think I want to hear this --
Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.
The faggot speaks.
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
I remember now, it was before the explosion --
"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
You can't threaten me --
Where's your shirt, Mueller?
Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
Sir, yes, sir!
Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
Who is she? Where does she live?
That would explain the indigestion.
Edward Bloom.
No one's ever left.
Don.
Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.
My father and I have an advantage. We never talk.
I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.
How did you know?
Go.
You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.
Terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power. Wasn't three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said, "Your Grampa is going to die." Well, I ran right back to my parents. My father said, no, Gramps is fine, but I could see there was trepidation. And true enough, that next morning my Grampa was dead.
Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
And I like you.
Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
Did you do any of that?
You think I'm up for it?
The Old Lady by the swamp.
Okay.
What did he say?
You're right.
You mean, while I'm here.
Dad!
But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
I wasn't expecting you.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
You didn't become crazy.
We rented a car.
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
Really! That's wonderful.
True. But I've known him my whole life, and I don't feel like I know him at all. Or ever will.
Yes?
Uh... Yes.
What?
Good. 
Right.
Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
Tell me what he said.
No. It's not that.
To be indoors on such a day. It's crime.
You can stay tonight.
Good night.
He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
Yes.
Yes.
They go.
I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
I said I don't have any.
I don't want to talk about him.
Fine.
You are throwing me out.
You don't have to say anything
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
She's dead.
It's alright.
Cash.
Yeah, I know.
That'd be nice.
No, ma'am.
For your hands?
You been home yet?
If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.
LAZ, I said let...!
You sayin' you'll do what?
BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
Best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to...
What do you want?
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
Uh-uh.
Look it... I put the Goddamn dress on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...
I can handle that.
You can handle it.
I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
Word wit'cha. In private.
She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?
What'chu sayin'?
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
Uh-huh.
I didn't start this, R.L.
You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
You sayin' that gun's for me if I don't?
Or what?
Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?
What's that chain around her for?
The fuck are all these people doin' here? Been drinkin' in this shit hole for years ain't seen this many people since I don't know...
My mouth is shut, boy. And that's how we gonna keep it. Don't go braggin' to ya buddies, ya heard me?
I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
Rae don't do this now...
You feelin' sick?
Yeah, I know.
Holy shit, Ronnie!  You're a fuckin' rock star.
Ronnie...
What we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop. I ain't callin' you no ho. But I ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. Remember... you called me.
Get rid of it.
Charlie...
What?
The Wolf?
Where is the subway station, please.
I said let's go, Charlie.
Let's grab some food.
What'd she say?
You'll take care of that.
Sure.
You were too far behind.
Big enough.
It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
Sugai's not going to be impressed with your gun, Nick.  No.  I won't put myself in danger for you anymore.
It's done.  You don't have to come.
Kampai.
We need the plate to negotiate with.
A wife.  She left.
Me too.
Because we're the biggest things to hit this town since Godzilla.
Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you?
I don't give tours.
Sure, but then I just pull out the photos.
Wouldn't help.  Watch out for Ich.
Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.
You are a lucky man.  Where you come from a man can stand out.  It's expected.  Here a man is made to look a fool for standing out.
He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
What...?  What if I say no?
Look.
Twenty-four hours, detective.
Goodbye, officer.
You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
Well stocked.
Would you like to be modified?
Nothing the God of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
Of course not.
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
Hello, glad to meet you.
Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
Okay, here it is.  Eldon Tyrell, his family and half his staff were just massacred.  The cat is about to get out of the bag.  Pressure is definitely on.  The Nexus program is terminated.  When you finish there, locate Nexus designated Rachael and retire.
Soon as I finish the job.
When might that be?
This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go ahead please.
Why, yes, of course.
Prosit.
Four years.
No.  I got a problem.
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
Huh huh.
I don't know nothing about it.
Are you for real?
It's a good job.
Come on.
But because your department can't do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule number at large, it's a problem.  Correct, Mr. Deckard?
For the responsibility of your power.  Being a police bureaucrat, you've got more than your share.
You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
It would be my child.
So?
So, I'm a piece of equipment. Use me.
I'm sorry.
I wish I could.
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
You mean a woman?
What's a long time?
What difference will it make?
Five, maybe six.
Know what a turtle is?
Hi.
You scared me.
Beautiful.
Is that why you're still here?
As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.
Sure.
Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
My office.
Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
Dickhead?
Oh, that's nice.
Yes, I'm right?
Get away from me!!
Rogers Hornsby?!?
Okay.  What the hell?  You got a deal. Get in.
Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your visit.
Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
Who are these people?
What?
I guess we'll need another locker.
Okay.
One who's not a mutant.
That's what I was afraid of.
Thank-Q!
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
No it's not!
Look unimpressed.
Maybe. But that's how it works.
Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
"All at once am I--several stories high-- knowing I'm--on the street-- where you live."  It's about a young man who is overjoyed just to be standing in front of the house of the person he loves.
No.
It was at least as good as the sky.
Gee-ma-nee!
Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
I've got to go, now.
That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it.
Tempus fugit!
Yes, father?! Yes?
I'll try.
That's what everybody believes?
Russia.
It's so small.
Why not? He has great pants.
I just don't want to.
My father is a genius.
You don't look thirty-five.
Twenty-five? Around there.
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
A psychiatrist?!
What?
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
No.
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!
Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
To you maybe.
Would you like a tranquilizer?
What shall we call him?
What? Whatever you want, Helen!
I believe there will be other survivors. In fact, I'm guessing there's life on the surface, even now. It's not life worth living perhaps, but believe me, something's moving around up there. And I don't just mean the cockroaches.
Just open the door.
Yes.
Yes, dear, I know.
To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about.
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
To bed?
Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
And if we can't find him?
Yeah.  Maybe he'll call.
The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Shit. Let's drink to something else. Let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
Yes.
I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
Yes.
Why do you do it?
Yeah. I get it.
Okay, I gotta tell you. I've discovered some things. Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
Oh yeah, that's good.
I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
You said hello, to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone? Don? And little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. And something about a Meadow Lane. Something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please.
It's okay. It's okay.
See my nipples?
No, please. I won't.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
OK.
Don? Are you in with them?
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK?
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
Please, please stay.
That's good.
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything, anything.
What if I told Frank that you opened me?
Frank would open you.
Shut up.
Beeeee careful.
Just get outta my bed.
Dorothy. No!
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
No. Not really.  But also because I really want you to be alright.
I want you to stay with me.
What?
No.  Hi baby.
Don. Help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
Hold me. I'M FALLING!
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Bull.
Frank?
Then, shut up!
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Well. Okay.
Alright.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
Where are they?
I don't know. He moved away.
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner.
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
Yeah, if it opens the door.
Yeah.
Yeah, but.
Okay, yeah, call.
Yeah.
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?
He got a little jealous.
Wow. Should you tell my father?
Who, me? Why should it?
I'm really sorry.
You want to go talk to him?
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Okay. Great!
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
Yes.
Right. Watch out for Mike, there.
Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away.
Up where?
Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah.
Any word back from the E.R.s?
Yes.
No, look. No rolling. Nothing needs to be rolled.
I-I'll tip her.
Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.
Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
An F.B.I. agent came by the bar. He left me his c-c, he left me his c-c, he left me this.
y-y-yeah that's what he said.
Aye.
He got beat up by a girl.
German.  Not in our neighborhood, man. A hundred percent Irish. No one talks to cops. Period.
What?
Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
Oh, we're good man.
Holy shit. Who? How many?
Rocco, this is the real deal. We must kill without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead man.
Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.
I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!
The Sicilians.
What about one guy with two guns?
Twist of lemon!
Respect is earned, Greenly, never given. Guys like you should have to follow me around squabbling for the scraps from my table.
Witness?
Who were the victims?
No. You sure you're okay?
I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
You'll make it outta here. You can't ever stop, not ever.
Y-Yes my son.
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
God have mercy on my soul.
Just go!
The... The funny man.
I caught your show down at the velvet room at the Holiday Inn, loved it when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.
OK. That's wrong.
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
He says. This is he.
No. This is he.
See, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. Whereas my strength would be --
No, just do it real quick.  I'll meet you down there.
Yeah, I heard that.
Five, seven, eight dollars.
Don't even say it, man.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
I don't want to use it.
You were spoiled rotten.
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
It's not a plan. It's just --
No. We didn't.
That's a long time to be in jail.
You were asleep.
Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
You don't know how to hotwire.
I'm not. But there's --
I know.
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
You really hit a guy with a bottle?
What's Hinckley Cold Storage?
OK. Mark that down.
Yeah. It's pretty good.
Nobody move!
I'll see you there.
I'll see you there.
He did?
We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.
Dignan, I --
It's called a racquet, Anthony, and you're holding it wrong. That's ghetto play. Hold it like this.
Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
Absolutely.
Because I was like you once. And there was no one there to help me.
Hector woudn't do anything.
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
Phil probably provoked him.  Where's he going?
No. I wasn't adopted.
Nothing. I was just asking.
Temporarily.
Uh-uh.
Abdul-Shabazz?
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
That's your friend Anthony?
True.
So who's going to know?
I can't believe you said that.
I warned you, Dignan.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
You know, when somebody gets electrocuted, their skin starts smoking. At least Swifty's did.
This is natural.
See you in a little while.
They said he's a drug dealer.
I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
Come on, Dignan.
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
Yes, I do.
What is it?
Not a whole lot, Bob.
I didn't have any choice.
Look. We want you on the job.
Jesus Christ.
Take him to the car, Bob.
I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.
I'm working on it.
He said you ran away from home.
Hand to hand combat?
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
The basic grammatical rules of robbing.
Why?
Where's that guy going?
No. I just have short hair.
Sure.
Fuck you. You a Hoto.
Right.
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
Don't you want answers?
Don't know.
And Danny Zorn, what was that?
What?
I killed them.
I'm sorry.
He's dead.
I don't know who that is.
I did.
How long? How long do I have -- 
No. There's nothing new.
-- it hasn't been two years --
Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
We can't wait to be sure.
-- where's left to go? --
What?
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
Get on it.
IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?
I killed him???
I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.
What do you mean?
Your first assignment was Geneva.
I want to come in.
Why you're alive?  You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive.  Because we want you back on our side.
This stays between you and I.  We finally have an edge. I don't want to lose it.
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
I'm getting on a plane to Berlin in 45 minutes, which means you are going to call me back in 30, and when I ask you where we stand, I had better be impressed. My mobile number is...
Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
You mean, did I want a date?
Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
Are we locked up?
Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!
Clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here.
He will. I know he will.
Impossible.  How dare you bring a panicky lie.
When will his trial be?
Armed?
A patriot!
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
It matters not, he is thy king!
Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
Tonight then.
I need you so much! I love you!
A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.
No English lord would trust an Irishman!
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you.
Where are my goddamn books?
So let's go. This place creeps me out.
Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!
You really don't remember anything that happened?
She had a new family. Not enough space for me. Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids. But... whatever.
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
Why's that?
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.
Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
Calm down, kid. Stand still.
It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.
Listen close then, fuckbag. You screw up again and I swear I'll flat out castrate you.
Been there, done that.
Wow... read something.
Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
What happened?? Where are we?!
Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.
I thought I was the bad guy!
You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff.
Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.
No.
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
So you decided to go to America.
You want my advice?
What is your name?
In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
That's all right.
I'd better be going.
Carrying charges, my boy, carrying charges. Here, sit down. There's something I want to talk over with you, anyhow.
Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.
Yes, something.
Not an easy day to forget.
No.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
All right. At a quarter to five.  Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?
Has it got a wow finish?
No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
Oh, Rick!
But Richard, no, I, I --
Oh, he never... well...  he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.
Apparently he has the letters.
Yes?
-- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.
Sam?
-- Is what?
Go ahead.
My office.
Yes, rather.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.
Yes.
I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.
I believe you have a message for him?
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.
I expected no less, Captain.
Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.
Find one.
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce.
What, again?
This is no ordinary arrest. A murderer, no less.
Perhaps not.
Victor Laszlo.
It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
His escape.
Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
Well, I forgive you this time. But I'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde, and it will make me very happy if she loses. Uh huh!
You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.
Huh?
Put that gun down.
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.
That is my least vulnerable spot.
Sacha, she's had enough.
Don't listen to him, Sacha. Fill it up.
Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you?
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
Rick, hide me. Do something! You must help me, Rick. Do something!
Good. Then have a drink.
Well, I don't think I can remember it.
You've had today's water.
Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.
No.
Wilson, do you believe this?  Take the damn water.
You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.
Fix raft first.
Water water water --
The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
Yeah, sure, what?
It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
Must be a story there.
I thought I did.
Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia didn't turn out well?
Not if you work for FedEx.
We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
"We're" not over-reacting.
So simple to say, so hard to do.
That's what I told the fish I caught. But I ate them anyway.
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
Yeah.
Mom, meet Jango.
The place is falling apart.
Forget it.
I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay attention.
That's why you're a gambling man.
What's it all about?  It's about being so thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what it's about.
Believe me I know.
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
Wally said to say, "Hello."
Two.
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
Not with the right girl you wouldn't.
It will be okay.
No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.
She knows how to take care of herself.
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
I can't go nowhere.
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
Nobody special enough, Curly.
But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*...
I wouldn't worry, Edna, that he doesn't have money. If he gets hungry, he can pick his dinner!
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
Is that soon?
It's okay--I don't mind.
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
Actually, someone did. I just didn't think I could eat anything.
What about the trees?
Is it true?
Mr. Rose, I'm in the *doctor* business.  If you want, I can help you. You don't have to go anywhere.
Okay. Then you can be of use.
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
No trouble.
Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is.
Almost.
That's right! A girl's gotta know how to defend herself, don't she?
That's right. I know you understand how I feel, Homer--you is breakin' them rules, too. Ain't that right?
You oughta know you don't go to jail for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*. Ain't that right, Homer?
Yeah, that cigarette ain't hard to find when you're properly undressed.
It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.
You're welcome. I was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us.
Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.
Sort of like a letter of intent.
Everything looks in order.
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
Gee... What makes you say that?
That's not a bad place to start.
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
It's not true.
After you cut her loose.
She walked.
I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.
So what? We hide, right?
We sure Big Al threw him to us?
You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...
I apologize for the inconvenience.
I can't do that.
Because you killed one of my crew.
You ask a lot of questions. Come on.  Let me see 'em.
Stake you?
Harder. Remember, I killed your buddy.
Well he's in town and he sure as shit remembers you. What are we going to do about this Jake? We can't afford to have a Fed onto us.
Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.
My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.
What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now?
You get an equal cut.
What do I have to do?
But the fucking Grand Poo-Bah of all jinxes? A bird in your house...
Did I miss something?
Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
How do you know I will?
I SAID, HOW DO --  Deal with that?
You want to talk about an old boyfriend right now?
No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time.
There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over.
No, I want my cut!
Your mess.
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
Do you even remember Al? Do you remember what he looked like sitting there?
No offense, but I've seen you fight. You gotta be kidding m-
Huh? Oh. She's alright.
We got a good thing going here. You want to blow it over an overbite?
I try.
You are Officer Richard Rottovich. And this would be Officer Walter Sobozinski. I'm looking for Jake Vig.
Look, I'm not a confrontational person by nature.
I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
What do you want?
You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross- departmental investigation. This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it.
What do you get out of it?
It's cosmetic. They don't cover cosmetic. Last year I had a tooth capped. The dentist tells me I'm not covered for caps. It's cosmetic.
Hi, Jack.  Welcome to the cesspit.
I despise the job.
Ah, we all say that. But if we hate it, why do we do it?
I don't know anything about it.
Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
Seven-fifty.
A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
You mean I won't resist them.
This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.
Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
Crap. It's not relative. It's unfair. Like your casino. It's designed unfair. And your croupier's a little shit because he goes along with it.
Really?
What?
Found a job?
That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there?
You don't like cheats, do you.
And I thought you were a bright woman.
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
What ten thousand pounds?
What about my neck?
Wait a minute...
It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
I'm Lucy.
And what do you do, Lucy?
Too much. Eighteen hundred.
Thanks.
Good call. Help yourself.
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
Do you have a Salon Prive?
We check every four days.
Why four? And not three or five?
Any exceptions?
I don't think so.
You won't. Not without permission.
It's a rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right.
What for?
Ever?
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
Yes.
Very impressive.
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
Well, there's the possibility of...
Talby, can you read me?
Thanks.
Do you remember the detonation time?
Hello, bomb.
Fine. Think about this one, then: how do you know you exist?
My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
Why don't you have more time?
That is correct.
You have no proof that it was correct data.
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
Out where?
Talby was in the air lock. You blew him out of the ship. I'm going after him. Turn on his helmet radio so I can contact him.
I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...
You'll have plenty of time for that, you know. Figure it this way: twenty years in space and we've only aged three, so there'll be plenty of time to stare around...
The waves at Malibu and Zuma were fantastic in the springs Talby. I can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit...
Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
Yeah.
No?
You haven't figured this out yet, have you?  You walk in here thinking you're gonna cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging... But see it's really the other way around.  You think I'm the whack, when actually you're the whack.
I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down.  Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job.  Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape.
He's got exposure.  He sees you starin' at fifteen to life, there's a chance you could roll over, cop a plea, who knows? Man's figured the odds...and he can't take a chance.
Who's Camille?
Could you give us a moment.
It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued, causing you to maybe take offense.
No way.
A grand.
Look, I'd really like to...
We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.
Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.  But things will be better when we move to a new place.
Then I'm gonna do what you do to make me feel better when I'm sad.
Mommy, where are you?
When?
Soon, baby.
Yeah...
Completely different situation.  I steal things in order to sell them.  For money. It's called commerce.  But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.
Bent?
You did go through my stuff.
I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...
Your basic hodge-podge.
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
They want me...bad.  Or at least they don't want me grabbed up by the Chinese or whoever.  Best case, I wind up back in that facility.  More likely, it's a long drive out in the country, if you know what I mean.
I'm sorry.
On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.
Zack... He made it... He's alive...
But she does work here?
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
Oh?
More money... Like I'm shocked to hear you say that.
I'm you, I take that money and get outta town while you can.
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
Straight.
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.
They're prisoners to their genes.
So are dogs.
Only one I can think of.
Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
And she bought that?
Feel like the dog's dinner.
Probably a touch of what's going around.
Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
You left out condescending.
Does this person have a name?
I'm a toy to her.
No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
Okay, okay, okay--
Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.
Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick.
No, I mean... you love your son?
Pick a song, Hawk.
I-I c-can't...
My dad's company is relocating him. We're moving. That's why I was acting so freaky in school today. I thought it was the last time I'd ever see you. Anyway, open the box. I would have given it to you this morning, except... like I said, I was freaking out.
So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
The paint!
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
Nah. Couldn't be.
Hey, disco dude, it's cool...
They're what?
All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.
Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me.
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
I just lost my virginity in a confessional booth! Lord have mercy!!
That's it?
A bustier?
Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.
Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes, "Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole." We're going this time and that's all there is to it.
It's not nearly enough, punk.
You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.
Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness? That darkness is part of their natural development.
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.
Hey...
I'm sorry.
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
Why not just buy your baby a night light?
Are you okay?
The Lifeline is divided that way.
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
Frank.
Who is the boss?
What about your family, Donnie?
Donnie... I want to hear about your friend Frank.
Goodbye, Donald.
What's her name?
Well, Jim, I think you're full of shit!
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
He was a year ahead of us?
How did you know --
I caught him flushing pills down the toilet. He knows you check the container.
I guess they made him do it.
Rose, I'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and I respect you as a WOMAN. But after witnessing your son's behaviour today, I have... significant doubts...  Our paths through life must be righteous. I urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear.
You-betcha.
...Yah -- well, at least, y'know, I got to perform. And Mom got to see me.  I guess number eight only worked for Diane Sawyer...
Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go.
I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.
Your parents'd kill you.
C'mere. I love you so much.
Good, 'cause this isn't an American Teen Princess Pageant -- it's, it's Nazi Germany!
Oh, Amber, like you're the only one who visits Mary.
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
Hi.
NO...  It's all right. I got it. Don't worry about it.
Bye.
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.
Girls check in, but they don't check out.
Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know.
All right, let's go.
I swear to God she can't do anything by herself.
Shut up, Hank. This here's business.
I will if you shut your piehole.
There's your paint can. The next time you drink window cleaner, I'm just gonna leave it in ya.
He should be king!
King Solomon was game he gave each Girl his name to number them would make a list that long I'll bet his thousand wives led miserable lives if the king can do no wrong.
"My dear President"...
I'll have to enclose the check first.
Gloria, much as I hate to leave, I'd be crazy to stay here.
What's the matter with you?
Well, maybe he's still the vice- president.  Now if I were to offer you --
Sure, that's easy.  You gotta insult somebody.
Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden...
I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll give you Mrs. Teasdale as security.  or my jackknife.  If you want my advice, you'll take the jackknife... I've a better proposition...  Make it $25 and I'll give you a first mortgage on my son and I hope you foreclose.
Bah!! 
Oh -- you mean... worm?
These are the laws of my administration: No one's allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke -- And whistling is forbidden...
Your Excellency, you mustn't forget your appointment at the House of Representatives... Have you got your speech ready?
I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place.  Maybe you can suggest something.
THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
You satisfied your selfish whims, while nations tottered, dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion --  Not bad, eh?
Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
I thought everything was working out fine.
She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
Everything will be seen to.
Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.
Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?
Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
And what was that, John?
I'm sorry too. He simply doesn't belong here. He's be much happier somewhere else, where he could be constantly looked after. Believe me, Frederick, it's better that it worked out this way. Good day.
Well, yes.
I am very pleased to meet you.
You've never been?
Is he... dying then?
Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
It's alright, it was thrown away. No one wants it. It's just that it's a little dirty, that's all.
Yyyess.
My name is...
Righteousness...
Righteousness for his namesake.
Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to.
Very well, thank you. I have something for you, John. I'm sure you'll enjoy it, it's very popular.
Oh yes.
Good morning.
Yes, John?
Please... please thank the governing committee for me. I will do my utmost to merit their kindness.
Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.
Oh no, I couldn't.
No, no, I wouldn't change a thing.
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.
A dressing bag?
Well...
I'll send a cab. Here is my card.
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
I said welcome.
Well, of course. We always welcome friends.
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
It was different...
We never went to bed together.
I've never been to bed with anybody!
Of course.
No... no...
What d'you mean?
REALLY?
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
Well you started it.
Louder.
Oh, that's all right then... it's the thought... that counts...
Find it... AND cross it!
What?
He was lucky...  Sit there.
I know. Snorri! Get your oar out!
You don't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make "friends".
You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed?
What's it all about?
Who have you been talking to?
Make your mind up.
You may need a real Berserk.
Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
Well, come on!
No, don't say anything else!
I have to go...
You will wait?
He hasn't.
No, I'm not.
Get away, Snorri.
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
Together we stand!
How can we stops him now?
I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
You went berserk...
Erik's right! We'll all meet in Valhalla.
No... he's not... not... there...
Yes, Mother.
Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.
Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
And I just liked you so much.
You did? You liked me?
Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.
I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.
It's gorgeous.  Just my taste. I've never  gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked.  Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive.
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?
No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
Okay.
Shit. Shit. I know it's here. Hold on.
It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
I'm not a stalker.
The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
I'm just a bit of a wreck. "I sleep in your hat" makes me cry.  Me.
I'm fine.
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
Yeah.
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
Yeah? Oh, great!
Yes.
No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?
I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.
It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!
You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --
Joel, you're a liar.
I'm right here.
I don't like it either, but I'm just trying to find horrible secret place to --
Yeah.
Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
I love her.
I think she's great.
Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
Yes! I love that poem. It breaks my heart. I'm so excited you know it.  Look, houses in which we don't live.
I think we should go.
When?
That's okay. I --
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
You must have been crazy.
Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.
I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.
It's not somebody else.
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
Hi, Rob and Carrie.
I've got to finish this chapter anyway.
Yeah.
'kay.
We haven't checked.
Yup.
You love him, don't you?
Do you swear you didn't know?
I swear.
You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car.  He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love.
Hi.
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
Cole slaw, ice tea?
Well, thank you, Mary.
Oh dear.
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.
Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.
Save your breath for the climb.
The Clock People mistook me for Chinese. And the name stuck. In the same way that all Indian tribes came to be labeled "Indians" through the ignorance of an Italian sailor with a taste for oranges, it is only fitting that "Indians" misnamed me. The Clock People, however, are not a tribe, rather they are a gathering of Indians from various tribes. They have lived together since 1906.
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
Whooee!
Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...
Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.
Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
I'm in the Second Containment area. It's pitch black in here. There must have been a coolant leak. Man, this shit is everywhere. I can't see a damn thing.
You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...
EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.
You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?
It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.
Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?
What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...
I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers.
Weir. He used one of the explosives from the Corridor.
Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...
Some things you don't get over.
The Lewis and Clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt, she's docked in bay four.
I'm going in.
You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
This is not about my reputation! This is not about me at all!  The Event Horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. We lost the dream.  I have to go.
The crew? Could they still be alive?
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan?
I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
That is not acceptable --
"Insane?" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day...
It's 2041...
Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane.
That's exactly what we don't have, Doctor.
Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.
Starck, give me a read.
Justin?
But you can breathe it.
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.
...repeat, we're armed...
He's dead...
He served on the Goliath.
Dead ahead, 5000 meters.
Shit, Doc, any closer and we're gonna need a rubber...
That's the Core: the gravity drive. The heart of the ship.
We're losing atmosphere...
I'm trying, goddammit --
Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...
It must be hard, being so far away from her.
Oh, he did.
What did he do to the uniform?!
I don't care about rocks, I care about you.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
I already got it. Everything I want.
This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA. And Victor's not that bad. He's just a little...  Larger than life.
I know, I know. I'm just worried about what he wants... Speaking of which...
I'm sure he's matured since then.
Yeah, nine years straight.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Not this again --
You've been working out.
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
Reed's always right. Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
That's why. Because I could have any other woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not mine."
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
I was talking about us. Working together.
Right. That's exactly what I meant.
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny...
Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
Just find him.
I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love. To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
Arnold. What's happening?
I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign?
It's the first door on your left!
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
I thought I'd take it off for the drive over to IBM. It's kind of uncomfortable.
No. I want my money back right now.
I am so tired. I am so tired of dealing with morons. How hard is it to...
Don't strain yourself.
Where did you hear that?
Well... it's true.
See you later.
No.
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
Mark is a really nice boy...
No. Are you crazy?
I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.
You should work for yourself.
No.
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
All right. Pay attention.
I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.
Damone. It's Mark.
Yes.
That's me, Merv.
Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
You can't fix this car, Spicoli.
Really?
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
Climax together.
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
What's Doug do in Chicago?
I think they're both virgins.
No.
Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
What do you want?
Aloha, Spicoli.
No. I mean back to your home.
You keep them.
I know everybody says it, but I really mean it.
Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
Okay. Thanks.
He is. Don't worry, I'll get it to him.
They're everywhere. Nobody's safe. And sure as hell not in the South. They like warm weather... You'd never believe it. In L.A. it's out of control. First it was drugs, now it's witchcraft.
Naked.
A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type.
We will. You Samoans are all the same. You have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture.
The medicine? Yes, it's right here.
Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine. 
Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?
What limes?
How about a check?
BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
You cheap honky sonofabitch...
What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram?
I felt like a Nazi, but it had to be done.
That's good. You can't be subtle in this town.
...grow claws... bleeding warts.
Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry!
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
Where is everyone?
Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are still outside.
Buddy, I'm a full-blooded Chucktow. I can't think of a time my people haven't been takin' it dry. The fact that we are being eaten now, doesn't even faze me...  ...this is just another Tuesday.
Fuck you too.
He's dead.
What's in the back?
Just cover me. It was built to move.
Magic potion.  You should try a little.
Really?
Sure.
Huh?
Good.
What's going on between you two?
Seven.
Get outta here.
HELLLLLLLLP!!
Am I too heavy for you?
That's fine.
Make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. There's cars back there, right?
Oh...
Um, well...
'Forgive'...? For What?
Who's this?
Never mind that. I'm concerned about you. Your attitude.
Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously.
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
Where's Clifford?
An actress.
I didn't make the law, lady. I just enforce it.
Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad, huh?
You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?
I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.
I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just hold her.  Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll clear her head. She'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing.
I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense?
We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
Were you a drug addict?
He's a socialist, then?
I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
But I gave her my word. Besides, she's still your legal guardian. My hands are tied.
Thank you.
No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
That's right. I can't understand a man who puts strangers over his family, a man who gives up a good career to become a shiftless inkhorn failure.
Not me. But other people seem to.
But I'm not. The newspapers're --
Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy.
How'd I look?
Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it.
...So you think I should go.
Yeah.
Came to get a tan.
Yeah? What is he -- muscleman? Lifeguard?
You're telling me.
Some people starve, kid. Until we can do something about it, they might as well see a movie. Makes 'em feel better.
You're coming.
And?
Well... to get a crack at something good, you gotta earn it, you gotta climb the ladder first. So you do, you work hard, and all these people behind you are pushing you up, shouting you on. And then one day you realize you are, you're at the top... and there's nothing there. And you look behind you and there's no one below. You're just left there all alone... swaying in the god-damned breeze.
Have I told you how mean you're turning, York?
That's right.
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
I guess.
Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.
I don't know.
How did I look?
Oh, you...  ...ennh.
I'd ask you to take me home, but I'm a faceless sinner.  ...You smell good, Harry. Familiar, you know? I'd ask you to take me home, but...
Very slow.  But we're not going to stop, are we?
Wherever they're going, I'm going.
Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
What'd you do?
Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
But I want to. I'm trying!
'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, "This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.'
Oh Ma, they're not using me. It's just a chance to travel, see things. Besides, it's the only way I can get to New York.
Go on...
What's wrong?
Where are you going?
Wait, Mama, wait. I have something to tell you. I've decided... well... I'm not going to make movies anymore. I thought that's what I wanted, and I went after it with all my soul, the way you taught me, but I was miserable, Mama, and it nearly killed me. So now... now it's over. I want a different kind of life, something... simple. I want to live someplace quiet and peaceful... in the country maybe, and I'll have dogs and cats -- I feel so light suddenly, so clear for the first time in... It's going to be okay, Mama, I know it. And I love you.
Don't I know you?
Please sit down...
All right. Will you please sit down now?  Symington says.
No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"
Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?
Oh for Christ's...
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
What kindness?
People can be kinder than you think.
Your crime... as well as mine.
I don't know.
Yes. I want this over and done with.
A brain. Extremities.
There, there... shhh...
Is he not back yet?
She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.
He left a beautiful gift in her place. A baby boy. To cherish and love as our very own. Your brother
Is that what makes it so delicious?
If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
I give you my soul...
If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
Now husband and wife.
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die.
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now.
Is that your diagnosis?
Everything in moderation, Clerval.
Only if you'll tell me who he is.
And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart was broken?  Answer the question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein?
Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.
Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
Nonsense. Tonight you will draft an apology to Professor Krempe...
I'm... dying.
You want to leave?
And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes -- like you don't care about children...
I'll go take a look.
They're off now.
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
No. There must be some in the desk somewhere.
It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
A short somewhere.
That was the telephone.
I was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake. Besides yourself.
God, but I love that macho talk! Emergency generators! The Indian used campfires.
Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
I don't love Neddy.
I guess...
That's thirty percent.
What is your purpose in Mexico?
Open the door. I'm coming aboard.
Well, because you picked that place out of a hat, my brother's dead now. And this girl's family's dead.
You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.
So let's do it.
Vamanos!
Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.
I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?
Then stop, 'cause that's where we're going.
He's smilin' at us. But behind his smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack." I hear that loud and clear.
Forever together.
Yep.
Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
Scott?
I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.
Mexico.
Do you believe me?
Yes.
You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
Not many.
You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you.
I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.
He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.
You callin' him a liar?
I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.
What the fuck is she doin' there?!
There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
Really?
Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
What?
What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see.
What do you mean?
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
But are there... I mean, how many...
Standing right here in my office.
"Security"?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure?
I'm not out to change your sex, lieutenant.  You'll have separate beds, separate heads.  If you have specific medical needs, inform the infirmary.  If a classmate or superior acts in an harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner, please inform me immediately so I can deal with it immediately.  Questions?
Didn't take long.
Because I was civil, now you're complaining.
Did you just have a brain-fart?
No problem, sir!
Smoke her.
Hey.  Ain't your call, man.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  "Land-based maritime specialties." Gimme a second here to de-euphemize that...
Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously question whether --
I'd like to think our next Secretary of the Navy would be prepared for anything, Mr. Hayes.
Thank you, ma'am.  Um, may I ask what this is regarding?
Did you set me up?  Did you set me up just to see me fail?
I'd go Special Reconnaissance. Every bit as tough -- and we have a 60 percent drop-out rate among the men.
I'll work on it, ma'am.
Come on, Montgomery...
Sir?
She's a trainee, just like the others.  Why are you coming down so hard?
She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.
Blank faces here, O'Neil.
Only four minutes to neutral waters, sir.  Why not?
Well, guess I don't even need to be here...
Which is guy-speak for...
Thank you, Royce.  It was shaping up like such a tough call -- and then you go and make it so goddamn easy. Really, thank you so much.
I saw an article...
That's not what I want, Jordan.  I mean... it is and it isn't...
Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like...  Did I say he was class officer?
I can't go out.  Not like this.
I think you look beautiful.
Smoke it!
Could you have pulled that 210-pound man clear, lieutenant?
Any brothers?  Sisters?
That's not right.
Good to see you again, too, sir.
Your new roommate.
North?
MOVE!
Shut your hole, Slutnik.
I take it this file is still open.
Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day.  Know what I mean?
Where's Audrey?
Nearly four years...
Lucy'd kill me if she knew.
Only one way to find out.
Oh yes he will.
No.
You just left me without a phone call, a letter, nothing. All this time. Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad.
And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
Are you sure?
Yes. Do you realize that a creature like this could lay as many as a dozen eggs at a time!
I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes?
Oh, please, your life doesn't suck. His life sucks.
He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk.
Nick Tatopoulos.
That's the problem. He did.
Mr. Caiman...
So have dinner with me tonight.
Listen, this is the time when the big boys have to go to work, okay Honey?
Me too.
Allez, allez!
And how should we do that, Sir?
Get your people out of there or I will.
Right. The worm guy.  Can someone get those people off the beach?
They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them.
What are you suggesting?
You were right.
555-7600. Tell them it's a code dragonfly. They should get you through.
...Yes sir.  Your quarters sir.
Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
Like throwing gasoline on a fire...
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
Oh, of course, I forgot! YOU have to be the hero, don't you?... Heaven forbid anyone else get the spotlight once! Oh no, Jason Nesmith couldn't possibly-
Nothing.
That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this?  Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT.  VIBRATIONS.  Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
Oh, and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us?
Hey, watch that "Laredo" shit.
You have a better plan, Alex?
FRONT ARMOR IS GONE! JUST SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE!
Yes you did.
We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...
What does the Omega 13 do?
My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman.  He's seen it 13 times...
The enemy is matching velocity.
... What does that mean?
Covalent... Right. So...
Never mind, Fred....
It's ... incredible.
We're doing episode 31, Jason?
It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!
Whatever, the one with the hologram. The wall of fire.
We made It. Commander, we made it.' m ALEXANDER sort ov) By Grabtnar' s h~mmer, we  ove to te   ono 'tale.
On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.
Ninty-nine percent of ACTING is commitment. ACTING.  Stella Adler never manned a resonance cannon, she taught ACTING...
Why does this sound so familiar?
No I don't. But I know somebody who does.
We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
You are so full of shit
I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?
I don't know.
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
Right. Long live... What's your planet?
... Maintenance facility...
They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant...
Push It. Hold it down.
Okay, let's go.
How about the pig-lizard?
They always say that.
Over three hundred miles.
Exceedingly.  Besides, if I had half the wagons that were used to lug the rum to Philadelphia for this congress, I could move a whole army to the moon!
Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
As soon as the men have good shelters I'll move.  Perhaps Martha will join me this winter.
You go too far, Benedict.
You've served me loyally, year after year, without complaining. I've thought hard about you this past winter.  I want to free you, Wil.  I want to give you your freedom, after this battle is fought.
I ain't forgot about the freedom.
Well, general, I think I ain't got no school learning, I ain't got no trade... and I'm a drunk.  So, I think there ain't much left to be set free.
What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in?
But it's what he said, just before they killed him:  "I regret that I have but one life to give to my country."
He warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people -- even if it was against Congress.  George, the time has come for you to declare yourself king of America.  Listen to me, the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne!  George, you must declare yourself with us or against us.
I don't know:  delivering men and delivering men with their goodwill are two different things.  And, if he's popular with his men...
Makes you gag.
You invented this, this...
He has the soul of an aristocrat who'd like nothing more than to become a king in the minds of the people!
Again, just to touch on a touchy subject, but... would the people accept another leader over Washington?
We already have black soldiers in our army...
Well, George, Congress just passed a resolution censuring Arnold for destruction of government property. I wouldn't cast my fate with that man.
No, I did not.  Really?  Well, what the hell is a deist, precisely?
They are also very religious.  So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas.  One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader...
And, Hamilton?  Greene?
I... they look both the same.
Yes, I will write him and tell his ministers and the court.
My God, what?
I think I heard that.
Well, I wouldn't want to trouble you with this now.
Is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men? It's damned condescending!
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
Well sir, I was an ironmaster before you got me.  Maybe I will let you down yet.
But you are an aristocrat and a slave owner.  Sir.
You know very well who it is that I love.
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
I think I will disappoint you.
I'm lost in ecstasy!  And dost thou love, Thou charming maid?
Who says so?
You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
I mean I don't care.
Farrah. Come here.
Plan B. Here ya go, honey...
You spotted them, huh?
About sixty.
He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money.
Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way.
I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
Get something going there.
She's been out of movies a few years, but she's good. Real good.
Yeah, well, we need a ride somewhere, we'll let you know.
The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
Tell you what...
I'll find it.
Gimme an hour.
Bear, you're not really gonna -
You positive about that?
It's a different kind of deal.
You serious?
It's not the kind of thing you do.
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
Sovereign.
Whatta you got there... some kinda pop nine, the fuckin' Fiat of guns, always jammin' at the wrong time.
You're an investor, is that it?
Apparently, way it went, he invited her to come to Santa Anita to play the ponies with him. She told him what to do with that and he gave her one on the tush. My guess, he's by his lonesome at the track right now.
Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?
Or the guy thinks he could get 'em broken. You have to understand the loan shark's in business the same as anybody else. He isn't in it to hurt people. He's in it to make money.
That's right. As a matter of fact...
What's it called?
But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
I found him.
You have it?
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
I'm thinking of a movie.
Martin, look at me.
How do I know that?
Good-looking, too.  Like Karen.
You're not going to tell me the rest?
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
...That's what we finally decided.
Not yet.
Definitely not Martin. Movie stars never pick up the check. They have no idea what things cost. Most of them don't know their zip code and a lot don't even know their own phone number.
You don't like Martin much, do you?
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
What happened?
Continental, but it doesn't matter. Martin won't order from the menu.
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
What I'm thinkin' is maybe Momo could buy it.
Don't worry about it. I won't say any more than I have to, if that.
I'm thinking about producing.
Get down here. I wanna talk to you. Come on... right now...  She's gonna talk to Martin?
She's scared! Fear is an emotion!  Look, kid, if you remember anything from your time working with Harry Zimm, let it be the three key words to filmmaking.
I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.
I don't have a dog.
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
Shylock?
What is the vessel name, registry, and present position? Over.
Passenger vessel "Chimera." I will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is available at this time. I have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west, five seven north at...  Two zero one four hours zulu time. Over.
Arctic Warrior, passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea day two month two year one nine five three.  Over.
Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under the waterline. I don't think it's a problem.
Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
Bring it on, dude.
Or uninvited guests.
Why not?
The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull.
How long, then?
Three, four days.
Goddamit, Dodge.
Either way, they must've had a pretty good reason.
So we get a little more for the boat. Besides, the gold'll be safer where it is.
If they knew what they were carrying.
Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
Right.
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
Probably didn't have time.
What?
Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.
There's somebody else on this boat.
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't care if you don't sleep for a week. The sooner you're done, the sooner we can get out of here. How's the food situation?
Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's out of the question here.
Must not've been the captain's entry. He was probably out of the picture by then.
That much I think we've already established.
Either of you seen Dodge?
Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs."
I think I see it pretty well.
Of course they did.
You got that right.
Must be a little too the truth, eh Dodge?
Must've heard something below deck and went down to check it out.
Leave it.
Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here.
Who?
I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
Well, Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station. Normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience, but she thinks she can convince them.
What?
Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!
Uh, well, that's okay - I don't dance, heh, heh...
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
I'm sorry, Enid - you have to be an official high school graduate before I can nominate you.  I had to give it to someone else...  But I'm sure next year I can --
Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater...
What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!
This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives?
What do you mean "why"?
You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!
That's just the way I am!
Hey Josh.
These assholes are saying that I have to go to Summer school and take some stupid art class!
Forget it...
Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists.
Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp!
You can have that one.
What a little hosebag.
What are you talking about -- who?
It's still twenty-five minutes early.
We should follow him home.
I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
I bet they have tons of incredible shoes hidden in the back.
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
God, aren't you tired of Seymour yet?
It's a surprise.
If I promise you there's really a party with a lot of guys, do you promise you'll go?
Wait...
Where?
I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos.
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
Fuck it. Everything must go!
No, really...
No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Let's just try and keep everything the way it is.
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
God, I'm so sick of Seymour.
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.
He came into work.
I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
I dunno...
You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
Just because.
Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
Seymour does.
That's not even --
Norman.
You don't know what you're talking about.
I did too!
God, fuck you!
Indian records?
NO!!!
Yeah, well sure... you can if you want to... it's just I don't want all these guys in there at once... you know...
Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.
Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
Shh!
Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
For nineteen years...
I promise I'll take good care of it.
Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...
Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
Why?
Never mind, it's way too complicated...  Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?
I won't even dignify that with a response.
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
Oh, hi...
What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?
I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late.
I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
What's the matter?
I'm just being realistic.
At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!
...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and I'd just disappear and they'd never see me again.
Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems.
What do you want?
What do you want?
It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.
She's not at home?
Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
You're right. The Devil has come. Look at me. I am the Devil.
My wife is the game player in the family, sir.
Who else would hire me?  Beat you to it, didn't I?  Oh yes, almost forgot- brought you a little welcoming gift. 
Karim will have to show me where it happened. And of course, I'll need the donkey.  With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight. 
That is correct.  Nothing.
-I would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving-
Have you got that in writing? 
Let me save time-  you are the engineer;  you are in charge;  you're sorry I'm here. Right so far?  Good- because  I am not an engineer,  I don't want to be in charge, and  I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems?
All right- let's go into battle.  I'm Redbeard. 
You'd never force the lion to me- and nobody ever got a lion with one shot by luck.  Around there's a clearing- you'll know it from the anthills- get there and hide and listen to the sounds- I'll make the lion come directly to you. 
I got big. 
I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night.  Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two.  And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge.
I don't believe you had a mother. 
Patterson and I will be in the old hospital- where the enticing smell of sickness still lingers-  -and by the time we're done, I promise you, the odor of blood will be irresistible. 
Thank you, Janosz.  I've learned a lot here, but now that my baby's a little older, I was hoping to rejoin the orchestra.
No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night, Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs bite you.
I'm not saying you did.  In science we always look for the simplest explanation.
Thank you.
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
Oscar!  You poor kid!
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
Good luck.
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
Peter, what about the bathtub?
We'll take care of that.  Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.
Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?
I'm not even good for me.
So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?
No, you can't, and I think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them. You may get some nice ones occasionally like Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard.  Anyway, we're just about out of time.  Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless pets.  Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...  ... Good night.
It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.
Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.
Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you.
The Upper West Side.
No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.
This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop.
Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come up with anything?
What's the reading?
Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had it with you.
I'd put my money on that Vigo character.
There's something very familiar about this painting.
Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?
Are you kidding?  We'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th.  I'm going to take 72nd straight up to Fifth.  Trust me, I used to drive a cab.
Oh, right, you told me that.  They came to America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I recall.  How about you, Winston?
I've lived in New York all my life and I never visited the Statue of Liberty.  Now I finally get here and we're taking her out for a walk.
Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
Have I done the right thing?
I was just going to say "eight."  You're fantastic!
Oh, that's nice, Louis.  I'll stop by if I'm around.
Hi, Louis.
So what do you think it was?
That's a violin concerto.
Thanks.  What's in there?
Nothing.  Is that the kitchen?
I know.  It happened by itself.
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
Okay.  Then I'll go.
Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of "dodge" or "hustle."  Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University.
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
Oh, that's very - unusual.
Remind me not to go to lunch with you.
I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
What calls?
Oh, really?  Well, I've quit better jobs than this one, believe me.
Yes, sir.  Don't worry.  We handle this kind of thing all the time.
And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
Yes, it would.
Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
Two wavy lines?
They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
You have to keep him there.  Do whatever you have to, but don't let him leave,  He could be very dangerous.
If you turn that thing off we won't be responsible for the consequences.
Gozer.
Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.
What do you mean by "seen?"
What do we do now?
My parents left me that house, I was born there.
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
Mmmhmmm.
What do you mean "choose?"  We don't understand.
I was suddenly thinking about going to bed.
Commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father.  Except that he can't heave out his ghost.
You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
You want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their hero.
That's difficult to say, general.
Or perhaps into a new one.  But here's to your God and the courage of our legions...
Ignore that?!  The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
So am I.
I met with Falco, and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce with the Germans.
You don't want to kill him.  If anything happens to him now you will be blamed... and he knows it. Besides, that gladiator school is a fortress.  It would take the army to break in there.  What you want is to... offer him the wooden sword. If he takes it, he's no longer the champion of the people, is he?  He's gone.  And you are a hero for awarding it.
Caesar, I did my best.  The Colosseum isn't under my control...
I'm mentioning you in tomorrow's athlete's section, legate.  So, I'd love to know your birth sign; it effects how people bet.  And perhaps you could tell me a bit about... well, who are you?
That's their job, isn't it?  To argue.  So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.
I've read of it.
But have never been?
Without him.  He'd be weeping if he overheard that.  Well?  The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.
Of course I know -- who do you think is paying for it?  The Emperor himself, didn't you know?  Why do you think Commodus came rushing up to the front?  Burning patriotism? Filial love?  He wants to be sure when he takes over there's enough cash left in the treasury to... play Emperor.  Watch out for him, Narcissus; he's inexperienced, but... be careful.
But you do exist.  Narcissus:  hero of the battle of the Danube.
Do you remember your Epictetus, that little homily we recited when we were children?  The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans?
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
Commodus -- listen to Narcissus, listen to the man who has never lost a battle for Rome!  You're young with years ahead of you before you gain the experience to wear the purple!
Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.
Tomorrow?
You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand!  Narcissus, the Republic is dead.  You think those Senators could govern?  For the last hundred and fifty years they've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of Imperial asses!
Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
Athenians...
They're studying with Cynics.
The battle is over.  The war is over.  You've won!
Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.
Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered?  If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.
I'm a Greek, thank you.  And I was brought up believing Romans were the barbarians.  Give our new colleague some of the Cretan white.  Relax, tell me everything, I'm your friend.
Think about it!  Just think about it!
No.  Tell them I'll do it.  But I want more posters all over Rome.
Before they leave, get gold.
Was I?
I don't know.
No.
But could I just tell you this one thing?
This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
No, I couldn't.
Benjamin -- do they know you?
Yes.
With a family?
Yes.
Ah. Where?
I thought he said by the monkey house.
Yes.
But you're not enrolled.
Well -- where are you going?
I don't understand.
Yes.
We just can.
I'll think about it.
Tomorrow?
Who -- that guy at the Zoo?
No.
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
Well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now. He should be checking in any moment --
Okay. Enough said. That's a deal.
Not exactly.
One of those outside agitators.
Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
Look -- she's all right. She's upset and she screamed. But she's okay now.
No, sir.
Could I make one phone call first?
Get out!
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
I have to go now. I'm sorry.
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
Of course.
It's down the hall.
Oh -- I forgot. The track star doesn't smoke.
What?
Because I don't feel safe until I get the lights on.
What?
Sit down, Benjamin.
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
No.
Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --
I want to say something first.
If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.
Do you want to?
Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
Isn't there something you want to tell me?
What?
What?
Wood or wire? They have both.
You're welcome.
Is this -- what?
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
Wait a minute.
Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
Neither.
No.
What novel did you read.
There!
The driveway's on my side of the house.
We're talking.
Well how long has this been going on.
No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
All right. Now let's get to bed.
Art?
I'm curious.
Why not?
Then let's hear them.
Benjamin?
And if you think I come here for any reason besides pure boredom, then you're all wrong.
Thank you.
I just don't believe you would do that.
Sir?
The toothbrush. I got it all right.
Goodnight, sir.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?
No wait. Wait.
Not if you don't want to.
I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --
Well -- when did you decide all this?
You got me.
What?
I know.
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to do with me.
Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?
Do you want to unclench your fists, please? Thank you. I can see in the dark, you know. I've been here quite a while.
But why?
Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
Mrs. Robinson?
Your bank, Mr. Kringelein.
Splendid!
Well?
And what are you going to do?
No -- no -- no -- no...
I don't like your tone.
Not with strangers.
Dictation.  You know...
Where downstairs?
I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.
I'm afraid not -- I usually do just what I feel like doing at the moment.
Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
I? -- Oh, no. I do only what I take pleasure in doing.
That is not the truth.  You do not want to be alone -- you're afraid of being alone -- I know you're afraid. I know you. You were desperate, just now, if I go away you'll be more desperate than ever. Say I am to stay with you... say it. 
When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school, it was a monastery, I learned to pray and lie -- and ---
What is the matter?
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
For Vienna?
Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
Don't worry. I'll be on the train.  He leaves.
In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
A little strange, Baron.
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
Goodnight, Kringelein. 
How's the beautiful lady?
Insolent -- Berlin manners.
If a young woman, a stenographer, -- etc.
Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.
The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.
Man -- that's terrible. He was a nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.
Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, -- 
Oh, don't go.
A man might what?
You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --
You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein -- a very good man.
You're a little too fast.
Should throw a great weight into the balance...
That'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock. 
Tomorrow morning.
Of course -- of course. 
Here, hold up!
Shhh -- here he is now.
We have a good many connections in England, naturally.
I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --
Then, it's all over?
Gentlemen, I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.
Next week.
Good morning, Madam.
Goodnight, Suzette.
Such nonsense.
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
What is this insolence?
I can answer for this, it was self- defense -- I can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them?
Have I kept you waiting?
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
'Deal with Manchester definitely off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have thought it of you.
You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.
Motherhood.
No.
What's that, Lilly?
On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?
Roy? He's always crying.
I like you, too.
I certainly hope not.
Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.
You know who I work for.
I know.
Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way.
What is?
Fair enough.
Nice to see you.  What am I doing in here?
Don't mention it.
You always did.
Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?
No. And you have to be.
The first day of the Delmar meet, there was a nag called Bluebell. I should have been on it. But that was the day after you came in here, so I stuck around to see how you were gonna be.
Even so. You still got time. Relax a minute, tell me what happened. Sit down.
I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
Uh-huh.
No.
It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money.
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
This time...
Mm?
I didn't say that. You aren't marriage material.
You called the doctor, huh?
I just do what the doctor says, babe.
That's just Lilly's way.
I'll sign that affidavit.
He retired.
I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them.
) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us.
You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day.
That's what I say.
Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here.
Thank you.
What?
Not many.
They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
Think Eddie had something to do with it?
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
Oh.  Sorry.  I'm on my way to the ring and --
I think someone broke into my house.
You sure?
And I should have a son who calls me "Mom".  Looks like we're both shit out of luck.
Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
I was trying to get away from someone.
Afraid not.  You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.
Get on the bus.
Call me Laurie, will ya?
That would work.
Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
You stole it?
Why not?
Can I come in?
Then I'll get caught.
I'm okay.
Who?!
The serial killer?
Yeah.
What is it?
But the dance is in the gymnasium.
Very insightful.
No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?
Is Tim there?
Reality check, dillweed.  This is 1995.
Someone's trying to scare us out of having this fair ... and it's not gonna work.
Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?
But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me.
Danny!!!
No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
To find the rest of your family before Michael Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling him.
Kara, no!
But surely Rogers isn't --
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
It was you.
There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
And I'm its deliverer.  Its calling card, if you will.  I follow it.  Protect it. Act as its guardian.  In a sense, Sam, so do you.
Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
A bitch.
I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants.
One thing, anyway--at least Penelope didn't throw out all your crap.  I bet Alice threw out all my crap after I'd been gone a week.
Go home!
Go home.
Months?
I'm lonesome already.
You're right!  We'll take a trip. A trip is what we'll take.  I don't want to talk about motorcycles.  I don't want to talk about tits.  Go home!
Haven't got one.
He and his love are like a retiarius.  Do you know what a retiarius is?
Oh.  I'd forgotten.
Sorry.  At least you've got a place to come back to.  I don't have a place to come back to anymore.
All the more reason to go to Africa.
In what way, pray tell?
Me?
I don't think so.  It could have been.
Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much." You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.  I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one.
Our pleasure.
Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
I wouldn't drop my gun.
Thank God!
Hello.
Are you--
Do you know who Wanda June is?
Life has denied me that thrill.
You think you could find me a pencil and paper?
Man and boy.
No.
Tell me that!  Tell me that!
We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!
I don't know.
We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there.
It's rather a disappointment these days.  It isn't there any more.
Sir?
Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?
Penelope!
Make it fast.
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
That's a rifle you have?
No.
Daughter--I love you very much.
You don't even know me.
This is crazy.
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
Situation.
Do say hello to your mother.
You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.
I had a trip.  We'll honeymoon here.  Go out and play.
You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.
I have a brain.
That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.
They don't have to feel like slaves.
It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.
He cried.
What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the blue soup.
Beautiful, you say?  It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything!  Beautiful?  Seven years gone--  like that, like that!  Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!
So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
I plan to live one hundred years!
What a handsome word.
No.
There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort.  These elements are lacking.
Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
Hello, Mother.
Oh dear.
And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
I've literally got to run!
I came back.
I can just hear the editorial wee- wee-weeing when Looseleaf and I start flying in pacqualinincheewa root.  I can hear the Alice-sit-by- the-fires now: "We discovered it in the Amazon Rain Forest.  Now we cure you with it.  Now we lower our eyes with becoming modesty as we receive heartfelt thanks."
You were wrong, you quack!
A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind.  It's saying, "Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown, clown, clown."
Poison.
I hate crowds, and I have no charisma--
Don't shoot.
Have it your way.  We'd both be better off dead now.
It's trash now, like mine.
New lives begin!
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
What will you do, Colonel?
Thought you were another wife, maybe.
Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.
He's a ghost!
No.
Okay.
I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?
He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.
I know.
If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.
Women are always late.  You'll find out.
We could have had some kind of birthday party for him.  We could have taken Paul to the fight with us.
We got a birthday cake, kid.  Did you see the cake?
As long as he keeps out of the park.
After this explosion, I think, he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again.
The what?
It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
What kind of a life is that?
No!  Oh no!  Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more.
It's suicide!
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that.
That's been said before.
Tell her to have a nice trip.
That maid just quit.  The place is a mess.  You can start in the master bedroom.
Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
We're going to have jackets, aren't we?
You sure? We have regular sessions, too. Only twenty dollars?
Shit! You just don't want to hire a nigger, that's all. I knew this was a scam. I shouldn'ta come.
What are you doing?
What?
I don't know no Tod.
I tried to get more, but this is the limit. The De Vries line has the same area.
What's that shade of blue called?
Pavonine. It's the same tint as the stripe in the fabric.
The other girl is the star?
You know her?
No. I saw her with Tod.
Half now, half later.
Yeah.  I'm her father.
Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?
No.
Is Kristen safe?
Out of gratitude for being chosen. That's where Grace comes in. God first chooses you, then allows you, by Grace, to choose Him of your own free will.
Why can't I meet him now?
Just a second. It's my ass I'm risking. You better do it my way. These fuckers don't mess around.
Do you live in a house back in wherever.
But what?
So I guess we're both fucked, huh? But at least you get to go to heaven. I don't get shit.
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
Who's paying you?
I suppose. But I'll tell you, Jake, I'm like a little animal. When I get my teeth into something I never let go. If your daughter's here, I'll track her down.
What have you found out?
No.
No.
Hmm.
Research, my ass. I suppose these are the 'extra expenses' I've been paying for? And in the middle of the morning, too.
You should come around more often. You haven't been around for weeks. Anne complains she doesn't see you anymore.
What plan?
I thought you were quite good in it. I also like the girl in it. Really thought she was good.  I wondered if she was still around. If she was still working.
Who told you about this?
Rucker.
They're all about the same. You want something?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yes.  I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.
Not exactly...
Cool off, huh? How's this for cooling off?
The guy who bought you that ring.
You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.
Was he with a girl?
Isn't this your vehicle?
Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.
Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
And that truck - is it registered in your name?
Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.
Where are the papers?
I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this?
Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
No.  I thought not.
Well, then, you must come back and visit.
Eh, fine.
She seemed yare to me.
Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
Oh, I'm so happy you said that because I wanted to show you my paintings. This is the "Rape of Rome" and, of course, there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of Leda and the Swan.
Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
Oh, it's all right. It's organic.
Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.
Oh come on. I'll teach you.
Yes.
Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."
Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away.
Really. Just put it there, Harold.
Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
Well, they're my species.
You should have been a poet.
But you're not going anywhere, are you?
Oh yes, dear. I took the pills an hour ago. I should be gone by midnight.
Please! She has got to see a doctor right away.
Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take.
Well, I want you to go to bed directly after dinner. You know how susceptible you are to colds. Harold has always been a delicate child. Even as a baby he seemed to be abnormally prone to illness - Harold, dear, eat up your beets...
To whom?
No. Like this.
Does that worry you?
I don't know.
None at all?
Yes.
Yes.
Your studies?
Then why did you leave?
No.  I'd have liked to.
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
Yes.
Harold! That's <u>disgusting</u>!
Oh yes. That's fine.
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.
Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
Sorry, friend. No day trips to Hell. Here you are. Here you stay. And forward the only way to go.
I'm a girl who keeps her promises.
God, that's terrible.
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
Kyle, you don't have...
No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.
I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
Nothing psychic about it. You're easy.
Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, one of the Reich's top Scientists. Head of the Thule Occult Society.
From where??!!
Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
No. It was red. Bright red.
I do.  How many escapes?  This year alone: five!
Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
Try not to stare. He hates when people stare.
C'mon, Champ! Happy Halloween!!! You're taking me for a walk!
Grounded? Who's grounded?
In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
Each of us gets a belt.
You never, ever light a cigar that way.
My job.
Father's back?  Still angry?
Oh-n-no -- I --
Goodbye.
Nah, sounds too "needy."
No. Not this time, H.B. It's been months since I've had an episode. And you know what? I'm learning to control it.
Goodnight.
Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
I like that...
He's just pushy.
Some things have to be endured...
Who are you?
Frank.
Back from where?
Later.
You would be. They tore me apart.
I don't.
That's probably her now. Or the police.
Sure.
We're going to freeze to death.
Just a thought --
No argument.
I hear you.
No you won't.
Can I get you anything?
I'll be down in a minute
O.K.
I've seen worse.
Please. I can't bear it...
I suppose that's right.
Let's keep it that way, shall we?
No personal details?
That's right.
What's wrong?
I won't be a moment.
Where are you?
I said: I found a room.
Take care, Dad.
You like?
Me like.
Upstairs.  Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.
It isn't. I know what's going on here, and it isn't over --
Can I lend you a hand?
Just go. PLEASE. I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad. He'll look after me --
What did I say?
Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
What are you snickering about?
Ehh.
Well... you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone...
Ha.
How do you know about that?
The band that found me and asked me to join.
Because it's in The Big Chill.
Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
Laura said we could.  If we helped out with the posters and stuff.  And we did.  And we are.
What do you think?  Dick likes it.
Barry, you're over thirty years old. You owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey.
It's the new --
No, not nothing.  What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
What are you talking about?
Look if you can't think of anything, it doesn't matter.  I'll do one.  My five favorite from the old days at the Dodger.
Fine.  That's great.
Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --
Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.  Listen.  Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man?
Oh God, no.  I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
Can I help you?
Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
Fine.
Sure.  'Course.  Rob, look.  Do you want to... talk about it, that kind of thing?
I want a tape.
Who's that?
You look upset.
Hello, Rob.  Remember me?  I'm Ray. Ian.
Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
I've already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck!  Now get your patchouli stink out of my store.
We won't leave it, Ian.  Not ever.
I dunno.
I should be so lucky.
I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
Yeah.  Great.
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
Will you please just go?
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
Is that the last of it?
It was kind of funny.
You know what I mean.
Mmm hmm.
Those aren't mine.
I can't talk right now.
Who the fuck's Pig?
No, no.  When are you going home?
Yes, of course.
Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob.  I've got too much to do.
What do you mean?
What?
Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.
But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
I'm alright.
Nothing.
It's no joke.  I'm responsible for what happens, you know.  Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  I have to put down a deposit for the room.  I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --
I know.  I don't get it.
I don't know.
How're you holding up?
Well she --
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
Yup.
I understand completely.
Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?
For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
Your lucky Laura's doing so well. If it wasn't for her, I don't think either of us would ever sleep...
But you must have --
I must have nothing.  Their my husband's.
Naw.  Those are for us.
No, we...
Nice.
Some guy named Smith was asking about him in Church Hill.  I passed his name around with your buddies downtown but they drew a blank.  So he isn't a cop.  District anyway.
Find the father.  That should clear things up.
Go to hell.
Claymore.
You're the expert.
Happy birthday.
No thank you, I'm fine.
Then you didn't know Richard later on.
Mother too.  Sad case it was.  The young lady just couldn't make it through labor.  Never even saw her son.
You owe me.  Besides, I'm cute.
It's not mine.
-All but one out of a hundred, I know.  All left to be led like donkeys back home.  Now if you will please-
Good day, Miss Cartwright.
People like that rarely leave business cards.
You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.
Where?
He called you "MacLeod".
Have you gone to the police?
Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder.
Not all of them.
You want me to front for you.
Well, as long as we're stuck here.
A little dusty.
And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
What do you want from me?
Four?
It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
Your name is Conor?
Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist.
I am from Spain.  And I would like a moment of your time.
I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.
You know me home.  Me name.
You are still so very young.
You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?
Aye.
I do not think I like the sound of that.
I feel hardly nothing.
You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.
Of course.
With the proper tools, Conor, a naive man can be much more dangerous than an evil one.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
Do you have cause to bothering us?
They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
Equals?
It can be different.  It must be.
Thanks.
Yeah.
You'd think he'd had practice.
No.  I want this to be all ours.
None of this would be happening if you hadn't run...
Kahn?
How did you find me?
How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime?
You're wrong.
I only just heard of Conor.  I came up from Catroch as soon as I could.
Steven, Conor didn't die.
I'm sure that's true.
The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
Well, congratulations! Good luck!
The poem?... The poem was great!
Sort of a Jack London style?
He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake.
He certainly -- hic -- does!
Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game --
I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
The Criminal Courts Building.
I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin!
Yes, I know...  Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town...
I feel I ought to take care of her.
Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.
No, Bruce, you didn't come between us. It was all over for her before you came on the scene. For me -- it'll never be over.
So long.
Close that door. Don't let anybody in or out.
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
We'll take a chance on that, Burns.  Go ahead, boys. 
I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again.
I haven't any hard feelings.
Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything.
No, I can't.
That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --
Please! Will you just --
Look at this! 
A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! I know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? So a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! No, Walter, I'm through.
Bermuda.
The insurance business?
Too bad I couldn't see this guy first. I'm pretty particular about whom my wife marries.
Afraid? I should say not!
All right then, come on and let's see this paragon.  Is he as good as you say?
And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
Oh, I'm sorry.
So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
We're not interested.
Never mind that. What's the story?
You'll get it. Now what's the story?  I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
Give him the works.  Hello, Duffy, get set! We've got the biggest story in the world. Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post -- exclusive!
Railroad tickets.
Finished!
What happened?
Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --?
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
And what a way to quit. While you're still champion! That's the way to leave, Hildy!
Where'd you wire him?
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
You're not fooling anybody.
Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them.  We've got to get this desk out of here.
Sure, boss.
I think it is.
I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
They're always after me for interviews.
We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
Yes, I suppose so. It all helps.
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were here. No, Mr. Williams, we still have some questions for you. Sheriff, will you kindly extinguish the lights?
Mollie, drop down here! You've fainted!
Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!
Now, where is he?
Little rum in yours, too?
What?
Yeah. But I --
If there was any way out...
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
Ah, Fred --  Hello... this is Hartman --
What?
Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?
Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
It's a frame-up! Some imposter!
I can't.
You'll take fifty and like it!
I'm telling you!
Phone for you, Hildy.
I'll go right after it.
Nothing doing. I'm playing for keeps.
No -- what?
What's the use of fighting, Hildy?
So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?
Very simple, Earl.
Put down that gun, Earl.
No, no, you're right. I don't want to kill anybody. All I want to do is be let alone.
No, it doesn't.  Now, remember: you never delivered this.  You got caught in the traffic, or something.  Now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you.
His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. That is all.
Say them.
Sod.
Could.
Not now. They wouldn't believe me.
It's easy. I've done it.
Pauline.
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
...and six...
They've got the real thing outside.
That's it. When you tell a lie, you hope to get away with it. When someone else does, you want to find them out. A good batsman will spot a googly. A good bowler will hide it. Always remember that, son.
Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have.
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
You need trees for an avenue.
There was talk of planting some when we first came.
There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same time.
And I'm still just a lad myself.
And absent bridegrooms!
And it was the last. Hasn't written a letter since. Not even a birthday card.
You joined up.
Well, it's off ration. We know that.
Fair enough.  The river.
It's only a joke, Mummy. I'm fifteen. I'm still at school. I want to be a nun when I grow up.
Out.
Wasn't it lovely?
It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
I don't mind it. It was harder before the war. Trying to keep up appearances. Now it's patriotic to be poor.
Cone.
Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
You sure do a lot of guessing.
The animals have got nothing to do with it.
I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
A missing girl. I use'ta go to school with her, she just up and disappeared some day... real weird.
You mean John Wayne?
Yeah, I was never that big of a western fan. I like science fiction.
Well fuck me Side Sally, who want to read about all that horse shit anyway.
There always one kid with no bodily controls. We had this dude, Jeff Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker would just sit there puke all over himself.
If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot.
How awesome?
Hell yeah.
Way out here?
And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
Tasted pretty good.
I mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles.
We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.
Then run him over, he'll move.
Let's get going before that thing tries to eat the car or something.
Fine! I'll go straight!
Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace.
What I need are some answers. 
Is that all... think real hard.
Yeah, they weren't here but a few minutes, didn't really have time to get as up close and personal as I do with most of the assholes that wander through here.
Enough talk, write.
Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
Yeah, I guess I'll just help him hand out candy to the trick or treaters.
Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
Fried chicken.  Anybody want some?
Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.
Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
Dude, your chick's a little high strung.
Shhhhhh.
I know, that was some crazy shit. I never in a million years would have believed it if I hadn't seen it.
Scattered, smothered and covered.
I don't know... about half an hour.
I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.
Not yet.
Yep, I suppose it is.
Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
Huh?
No, just a little too old.
Don't worry, I'm gone.
Let's go see.
You, my dear worm feeder, are about to become immortalized.
I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl...  ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her?
No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
Right.
Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
I always favored the Hulk.
And think about what you've done.
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
Woof.
Oui.
Oui. Perfect!
Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
Yes. Happy happy.
Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world.
Hmmmph.
You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here!
God, you're beautiful.
I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.
No.
What an enchanting picture you paint of our future together.
Handsome, thirties, psychologist...
Loves animals. Loves you.
Yeah, well my brother is his shrink.
Oh, Rosie.
I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing.  I've been seeing someone. A therapist.
What's the larger experiment?
It's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice, they can be taught to humans.
Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
You do?
You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.
Why certainly!
That's a great idea.
I don't think so.  Why?
Yes, darling.
I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that.  Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?
I think we should go. Please. Before he wakes up and, I don't know, eats us, or whatever feral things do.
I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here.
I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...
Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.
That's great.
I had sold my fucking soul.
I let her sell her soul. I stood by as she did it. It's inexcusable.  At the time though I thought it might help.
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
Got it.
Unn.
Yes... Derek.
I'm an ape, mom. I'm an ape. And apes don't drop lines.
You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
Well, nobody has to sell.
Listen, Miss Ladybird, you're here on a rain check and I know it. You're hanging on by your nails. You let that glory whistle blow loud and clear for Eddie and you're a wreck on a railroad track. You're a horse that finished last. So don't make trouble, Miss Ladybird. Live and let live. While you can.
All I want's the money.
Well, Mr. Felson, maybe you could come out to my place some evening. We could play a few games of billiards.
Cash.
Mister. You been sittin' in that spot for hours. Would you mind moving? It bothers me.
Two.
I lost twenty bucks.
Look, you wanna hustle pool, don't you? This game isn't like football. Nobody pays you for yardage. When you hustle you keep score real simple. The end of the game you count up your money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only way.
Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
I been thinking.
Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
They're fine.
What do you want me to do, huh? What do you want me to do? Just say it and you got it but PLEASE don't get off me now.
Tell her what?
You gotta be hard, Eddie.
Boy, we really gave it to her good.
What's your game? What do you shoot?
What kind of straight pool game you like?
You well-heeled, partner?
You know what I mean. You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.
Nobody can make that shot and you know it. Not even a lucky lush.
You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.
In the gut, I mean.
I feel tight -- but good.
No, it isn't, Charlie.
Get with what?
Give me a drink, will ya?
Go on home. Just leave me the money.
I asked around.
Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.
What's the difference where? I'll raise it.  Is it all right if I have another drink?
Shoot.
Thanks. I will.
I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.
No.
Sarah.  Eddie, look. I've got troubles, and I think maybe you've got troubles. Maybe it'd be better if we just leave each other alone.
I'm not sure... I don't know.
What, are you kidding? See that book?  I've been trying to get through that book ever since I first got here. I haven't finished the first chapter.  Did you read all them books?
Don't you ever cook anything?
Yeah. For a little while.
A loser?
Would he know?
He knows. A lot.
I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose.
Two.  Sherry?... Nice joint. You look very pretty.
Why should I?
Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it.
I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.
I'll be up later.
Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
Hundred dollars?
What about... now?
What?
I know it.  What do you want, Robert?
Well, it's not supposed to be done anyway.
I know, son.  But you'll like it where we're going.  I'm getting a good job.  It's a pretty part of the country.
I'll have to go to a new school -- again.
I'll go take a look when the rain lets off.
What, Jim, what?
Where's your car?
You did?  Why? Where were you? They said you left hours ago. We were worried.
Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.
I'm not particularly interested, <u>Ms.</u> Magnuson, in what you think is correct. My wife and I are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want Jimmy with us.  Keep him in your office until we arrive.
She said the frog came from around the Copper Ridge.  She must've been behind the hill.
Behind my house, up on the ridge.
This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
Why, yes.
It's not paranoia. The embedding is very subtle. It's probably been overlooked...
Love was never our problem.
I could have evacuated the cities hours ago.  You know, when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. It's not simple anymore, Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to?
Strange thing is, if my calculations are right it'll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway. The signal reduces itself every time it recycles. Eventually it will disappear. Are you listening?
What're you talking about?
So think already.
Three, four. Move on. It's not healthy.
Spunky?
Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House.
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
That's not your call to make, Mr. Nimziki.
Be careful.
Really? Ballet?
I thought you didn't recognize me.
We're already over Mach 2!
You sure?
If we don't strike soon, there may not be much of an America left to defend.
Deploy.
Peace? No peace.
You are on your own?
Dad was onto something here!
Well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don't know what they mean.
Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.
It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
It's war.
How dare he?!
Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.  Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!
I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.
Mine, too.
What were they looking for?
No?
So it did.
No, Dad. You listen to me --
But what are you doing here?
If only I could have been with you.
Don't worry. He won't.
The floor's on fire! See?!
Dad!
Head for the fireplace!
Booby traps?
Hmmm... What did we talk about?
Dad, how can you?
The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad.
That was seven hundred years ago.
I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
I don't need camels.
Where's my father?
My name is Kazim.
Just a routine inspection tour.
I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain.
No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta.
Lost? No, we're not lost. We're on our way to Delhi. This is Miss Scott -- and Mr. Round. My name's Indiana Jones.
That was a misunderstanding.
Okay, Shorty.
That's it. Pankot Palace.
Read you loud and clear, Indy!
Get over here, damn it! Short Round, come on, grab onto me tight!
Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
First of all -- don't panic!
Keep stroking it!
Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that "a girl could go places in the Orient..." So, look where I got.
Wearing your jewels to bed, princess?
Don't catch cold.
You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door.
I'm coming, what's the rush?! Ohh! What's that?! There's stuff all over the floor! I can't see a thing!
What above the curves?!
Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
It's still a long way to Delhi. Who knows what might happen.
You got it!
Why not.
Al.
I see...
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
Where are we?
You've heard of U.S.T.?
Loading a gun.
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
Can't see a Goddamn thi..
Too late...They want you.
Yeah.  Al wants to talk to you!
You gotta help.
I did. I brought you back here.
Just walk down the hall?
Who did?
The man.
I can't remember..
What do you mean?
Gone where?
Who cares?
You are in trouble. Now do it.
Oh yeah, to what?
You'll be me.
Little late for that.
You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
It's sand.
...Rene...
But, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire.
It is my business. It's my name.
The beautiful one.
Just hold them close and stay still.
You can't listen. You can't watch either.
I mean it. You watch old tapes of the ballgame, I'll fill you in... later. I mean it.
Shit! You're in love.
It wasn't like that.
On what?
Just stay here and rest.
Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
...imagine a better grape for the region.
A hard left. A hard left.
You said 100,000 yen for the right Sony Walkman.
And Dieter?
...Shit! It's just money.
Keep thinking.
Don't worry about me. You take this time for your own, you two.....
That's nice.
Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.
Look, I don't know how we're gonna get out of this.
I'll prove it. We'll repeat their procedures...put a man in our POD, bring it down, and then...inject him.
We'll let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM.
They took the tapes.
He work for us?
It's the least we can do. After all, it's our responsibility.
Yes. Joe.
It is to me too.
I think I've heard of you.
Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright?
Thanks.
Here?
I will?
Take the card.
Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you.
Much better now, thank you. Just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon...
What's what?
You did. JOE No I didn't. You said   something first.
The poet...something he said...
Why?
As if your mind's not all there.
I am sort of scattered.
You're talking to me.
Just Okay...
How often they come here?
You seemed interesting.
They kidded me a little.
This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
Food doesn't agree with me.
He must be a good friend.
What is it?
Oh sure.
Then why are you smiling like that?
Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
Too late, they won't come back out till morning.
Oh.
He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
I know the territory.
Can you?
That I really don't know.
Can't you do something?
It was my choice.
Why not, what are you going to do?
I'll come back for you.
Her?
It wasn't me. It was him.
I don't know.
...Mr. Athol will be with you as soon as possible. Will you be able to wait?
It will be fine. You have another.
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
Hi, Daddy.
Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
In the backyard.
How long?
What? Forget it.
What I mean is, like, how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement?
Sure.
...fuck is this? Fuck!
How about you?
It's not a rumor. It's a sale.  If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share to Westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from Brown & Williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not?
CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
What caliber is your gun?
How grave?
Catch you later.
I didn't want to leave it there...
"60 Minutes," the television show?
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.
From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures.
Area code 212-555-0199.
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
Yeah.
Okay. Thank you.
Don't interpret that!  Hold it. Hold it. Hold it! Slow, slow!!  Sheikh, do you mind... if you would just turn your chair a little bit to face Mr. Wallace?
Alright. What did you think?
Yeah, that's right.
Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way.
What are you talking about? Where are you?
Jump in, quick, c'mon...
Good. I want to talk to you.
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
They're afraid of you, aren't they?
They should be.
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
Next to your father?
My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
...to a network, probably, we're all commodities.  To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.
No, don't evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or "60 Minutes'" with this cheap skepticism!
I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! And what are you puttin' up? You're puttin' up words!
Words! While you've been dickin' around at fucking company golf tournaments, I been out in the world, giving my word and backing it up with action.
B & W may have threatened litigation... CBS is on the block...  But you, I mean, I know how...
Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview... where you're saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics...?
What does this have to do with my testimony?
That's not the point.
You fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
You try and have a good time.
No, you can.  Tell him to get on the fucking phone!
What do you mean there is no family?
Mike's our Attorney General down here.  I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.
Dr. Wigand, you do understand what could happen, don't you?
And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?
"The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers..."
Object to the form!
It acts as a...
Object!
And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. It's spooky how he can concentrate.
I appreciate all that, Jeff. But, upon reflection... we've decided to expand our zone of comfort with you.
He --
Please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing --
She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh.
Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up and...
What part?
So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them...
Miles! Don't waste time with someone else's queen, either.
Thanks, buddy.
What do you mean, was.
I don't know, but don't call me Marylin.
Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
I said yes.
And you must be Mr. Massey.
Gotcha.
Well, don't look at mine!
Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
That is correct. Not to blow my own horn, but they devote an entire semester to it at Harvard Law.
Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
Marylin! Listen to me.
Miles. Miles. Miles.
Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --
Okay Miles.
And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
Yes.
Yes. Again.
Hello Marylin.
May I come in?
On the contrary. We're married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine.
Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
You do? You do love me?
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
We are. And it's winding down.
Marylin?
We were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.
You used his credit card.
He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.
Shit.
Probably. Every woman in my life was divorced at least twice. What was I supposed to say. Anthropologist?
So what?
I guess.
He tricked you. With a phony wife and a fake pre-nup. Howard Doyle. He got you. You married Marylin, didn't you? You thought she had money. HA HA HA. Howard Doyle made you think that because of what you did to me. And to Marylin Rexroth. Yeah. I heard all about it. My brother Howard Doyle got you.  Neener neener neener.
She's here now.
My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
Ha Ha.
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
And she had private investigators assisting her.
Berry spoons.
...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
What...?
Should we counsel fear -- or trust? Should we seek to destroy -- or to build? Should we meet our clients' problems with cynicism -- or with love?
Mother?
I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
Three is not Farrow.
What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her. 
Yes, sir?
What ten thousand?
Who said anything about a reward!
We'll go into that some other time.
The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to
A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts.  She's my idea of nothing!
I might.
All right! Put me in chains! Do anything you want!  But I'm not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat!
Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because
If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India.
In that event, we won't need so many supplies.
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
No, I'll go through with it.
Is that his name?
Of course I mean it! I don't care whom she's married to  as long as I can get her back. 
It's not quite that simple.  I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one
Yes, of course.
What do they say?
Amateurs!
Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
You win!
Wellof all thewell  Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone.
Don't tell me your ticket was in it?
I don't want it reported!
No, thank you.  Thank you so much.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments. 
Smart aleck!
Listen, BratI'm going to count to ten. If you're not out of bed by then I'm going to yank you out myself.
Like what?
Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it.
Hurry up and get dressed.
Egg. One eggdoughnutsblack coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
Don't look at me. I didn't marry King Westley.
I'm sorry I didn't take another sock at him.
I refuse to resign!
Yes.
I was never built for these moonlight strolls.  Why did we have to leave the bus?
Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.
To New York?
Sorry.  It's the first time I've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
And he carried you like this, I suppose.
Show me a good "piggy-back" rider and I'll show you somebody that's human. Take Abraham Lincoln, for instancea natural "piggy-backer."  Where do you get off with your stuffed-shirt family?  Why, your father knew so much about "piggy-back" riding that he
Oh, Peter 
But what!
was so scaredthat it scared
You think it's simple, huh?
Hm? Yeah, but it's no good if you haven't got a long face with it.
When you get up to a hundred, wake me up.
You! Don't make me laugh.
You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a carand I won't use my thumb.
What happened?
That's swell!
I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
Me?
Maybe.  Suresure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't? If I ever met the right sort of a girl, I'd  Yeah, but where you going to find hersomebody that's realsomebody that's alive? They don't come that way any more.
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
Believe you me, you bore me to distraction.
Yeah.
Huh?
That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollarsand I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
Yeah.
Okay, pete. 
Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
Great!  But that's the way things go. You think you got a swell yarnthen something comes alongmesses up the finishand there you are.
They made me get 'em a rope and a blanket, on a night like this.
"Tub of mush. Well try and get it. What I said about never writing another line for you still goes. Are you burning? Peter Warne." Well, that will be $2.60.
He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.
Say, Buddy
You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
But I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids. I can't get mixed up with
If you don'tEver hear of Bugs Dooley?
Al, you can't tell a mink from a coonskin unless you see the fur up close.  Goddamn, Sam!  If we don't start reading between the lines here! Y'all gotta start thinking on a different level - like the CIA does. We're through the looking glass. Here white is black and black is white.
Well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt.
Now that's pretty important, Dean. You also told the FBI when you met him, he was six foot two.  Then you tell the Commission he was five foot eight.  How the hell did the man shrink like that, Dean?
Three, four.  He came in with a few Cubano swishes one time I remember...
Mario, Jose - they wear names like you and I wear clothes.  Today the name is Candy, tomorrow it's Butsie. I wish I could help you, Jim.
I couldn't be more serious, Jack. Those big red eyes have me wondering about your loyalty.
Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember.  Stick to what you can prove in court.
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
Yes, you are.  Look we know Oswald didn't pull that trigger.  Castro did.  But if that comes out, there's gonna be a war, boy - millions of people are gonna die.  That's a hell of a lot more important than Jim Garrison.  Goddammit, look at me when I talk to you!  You're too goddamn self- opinionated, now shut up.  If you got a brain in that thick skull of yours, listen to me.  Listen real hard.
Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.
Not unless we go for Shaw now.
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
Twenty dollars each time.  Hell, it's no secret.  That's what I'm here for.
At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
I think we should have him in for a little talk.
Where you going, boss?
Thank you... Mr. Shaw.
What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions.
Yeah.  Come on, Dave, come on our side.  I guarantee you the boss'll protect you...  Dave?
...give me protection?
Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.
They're Agency, too.  Don't you get it?  CIA and Mafia together.  Trying to whack out the Beard.  Mutual interests.  They been doing it for years.  There's more to this than you dream.  FBI fucking hates the CIA.  Navy Intelligence got something to do with it too.  Check out "Alan Pope" in Miami.  Jack Youngblood. Bill Harvey.  Colonel Roselli.  The shooter, I hear, was a Dallas cop - the bagman at Ruby's club.  I heard he shot his own partner.  Got that? Check out the rich fucks in Dallas. H.L. Hunt.  He's dirty.  That's all I know.  But the Agency always runs the show.  Check out something called "Mongoose"  Operation Mongoose. Government, Pentagon stuff, they're in charge, but who the fuck pulls whose chain who the fuck knows, fun 'n' games man - check out Southeast Asia - that's the next big number - the heroin trail.  "Oh, what a deadly web we weave when we practice to deceive."
How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
No, I never saw him before in my life.
Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car.  Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?
Who was paying you, Dave?
You make it sound like some remote fuckin' experience in ancient history. Man, you never leave the Agency. Once they got you, you're in for life.
Oh man, why don't you stop.  This is too fuckin' big for you!  Who did Kennedy?  It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma.  Even the shooters don't fuckin' know!  Don't you get it yet?  I can't be talking like this.  They're gonna kill me. I'm gonna die!  I don't know what happened.  All I wanted in the world was to be a Catholic priest - live in a monastery, study ancient Latin manuscripts, pray, serve God.  But I had this one terrible, fatal weakness.  They defrocked me.  And then I started to lose everything.
Your Honor, I would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question. Why did Colonel Finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck?
Oh yes, there were admirals - and when you are a lieutenant colonel in the Army you just follow orders, and at the end of the autopsy we were specifically told - as I recall it was Admiral Kenney, the Surgeon General of the Navy - we were specifically told not to discuss the case.
If that's your case, you didn't have a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.
I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
None either.  It's bizarre.  It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out.  Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63.  A man who has defected once already.  It's crazy.
Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
I wouldn't imagine where.
No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
You really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters, don't you, Mr. Garrison.
I've spent half my life in the United States military serving and defending this great country, Mr. Shaw, and you're the first person I ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president.
Now just a minute, sir!  You're way out of line!
But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.
You know I don't like these tribal rituals, Freckle Face.  I'm interviewing Clay Shaw this morning.
Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?"  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!
I don't know what to tell them.  How 'bout the truth - I'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice won't be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis.
It's going to get worse, honey.
I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you.  You've changed.
You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm taking the kids to my mother's.  I am - I am.
I don't think so, Jim...
He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.
Oh no!  No!  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!
A photographer from The Dallas Times Herald got some great shots of them never published...
The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.
One shooter.  One spotter on a radio. Maybe three teams.  I'd say these were professional riflemen, chief, serious people.  Hunters...  patient. It takes skill to kill with a rifle, that's why there's been no execution of an executive with one in 200 years... "3-2-1...  green!"  Or else "Abort!  Abort!"
The Warren Commission call him?
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
You sure got it.  You're one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch D.A. and you're making one hell of a mistake!
Don't get me started on that.  Those Warren Commission fellows were pickin' gnat shit out of pepper.  No one's gonna tell me that kid did the shooting job he did from that damned bookstore.
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever you like.
No, it can't!
Yes.
I'm not with the Agency, Mr. Garrison, and I assume if you've come this far, what I have to say interests you.  But I'm not going to name names, or tell you who or what I represent. Except to say - you're close, you're closer than you think...
...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...
His name?
It never did. 
Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer.  I wasn't really part of the operation, you know.  I was handling the private-eye work for Guy when that came in - not much did - but that's why I was there... it was a nuthouse.  There were all these Cubans coming and going.  They all looked alike to me.
And Oswald?
Clay Bertrand.  He's in the Warren Report.  He tried to get Oswald a lawyer.  Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?
He'll never make it.  If he wins, they'll kill him.  He wants to avenge his brother.  He'll stop that war. No, they'll kill him before they let him become President.
Yes, thank you, Mr. Garrison.  Your coffee's almost Turkish down here but I could get used to it.
Germany.
But then you told her you were home.
That requires me goin' out tonight?
Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk no minutes. Why don't I just ride with you?
Look, man, I know I owe you --
The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air.
If I were to tell you "no it isn't..."
What's in it?
That's my diet shit.
Thanks.
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
Is it dark?
Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me.
The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
I didn't?
How many trips did you make?
You went out this morning and bought a gun.
It looks nice.
I got a few. But I can't afford to start all over again. I got too much time and money invested in my records.
'74, I think.
Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point.
Bigger?
I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.
Sit down, leave the bag under the table?
I see.
If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
You're avoiding the question.
That's my job.
He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- So after a couple hours I think, "What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it.
That's what you do to go through with the shit you start. You rationalize. I can do this, Max, I know I can. But I can't do it without you.
Then you're out and you get nothing.
That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
In a dress.
So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
What if he hears something he's not supposed to?
What's he doing?
They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?
You'll get over that.
Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twenty-five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County before your arraignment comes up.
You know what's in the bag you're taking?
He say is a surprise.
I know what it looks like.
How can you help us?
Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity.
You two meet?
Not really.
What's her story?
What did you say?
Was she there?
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
Well, it's true, isn't it? After this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. What do you think?
I never have. It's not my money.
I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
There was a guy with Melanie?
This guy with Melanie, that was Louis Gara?
I have no evidence of your taking anything. You didn't pay for your snazzy new suit with marked bills; I was glad to see that. You've been helping us out, you gave us Melanie and Louis. Melanie had a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts when they found her, which goes a long way backing up your story.
I'm waiting for the phone.
Great...  ...Wanda!
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
Thanks.
I was expecting you. Come in.
Got some o.j.?
Sure.
I been thinkin about that, too, and I got me a idea.
Didja tell 'em anything else?
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner.
What the hell you talkin' bout?
She don't know shit about the money.
I told her this is a game us rich folks play, exchanging gifts. Like a scavenger hunt. She didn't know what that was neither.  No answer?
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
The fitting room. There's a sign over the door.
Yeah, there's another hit left.
Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
The beach. Or get high, drop acid at a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S. girl. I hated disco.
I don't like dancing.
Did you ever go I one?
Gimme that bag before I knock you out and take it.
You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go "bleep." That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
Uh-huh.
What did he do?
Well, why the fuck keep her around?
I told you, man.  She my fine little surfer gal.
That's what I gotta tell you. She bugged me the whole time. Got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag. Started running her fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. "Is it this aisle Lou- is, is it that one?" She was totally fuckin' with my nerves.
Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
You shot her twice?
We went to the parking lot.
If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.
That's why I never checked it. The bag felt right.
Then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off.
I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie, get something to eat.
Where would you like me to put my ash?
Oh, yeah? What did he do?
Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab.
Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called.
Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
She's been there since Thursday night.
Uh-huh.
By herself. That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he?
Turn left.
We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street.
Try not to rip his clothes off 'em they're new.
No! Oh God.
Like Della.
LET GO!
It's short, huh?
They're not interested, Jake.
It's cold.
I'm too messed up to teach.
Nobody's been talking to nobody. You don't have a case, you hear me? It's pure and simple. Now leave me alone. Okay?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
What else did he say, Jake?
A couple of weeks, I think.
How do you know?
I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
She didn't. That's about all she said. Put your hand up. Good. I think she still loves you. Take a breath and let it out.
I had to get in there. A deep adjustment. Rest a moment and let it set a bit.
What?
Louis, you're a life saver.
I know.
The postal service. I'm a mailman.
Likewise.
Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady.
Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
This is healthy? I'll probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy.
What the hell did you do, move all the furniture?
Gee, thanks a lot.
If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was.
Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
Where'd you leave 'em?
Maybe you left 'em in the bathroom.
Who? Jed?
You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?
I enjoy crushing into you.
They weren't human!
Get your clothes off.
What are you talking about? I'm freezing.
That's your decision.
Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
In a way. At least now I have some idea of what was happening. If we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... I don't know. Maybe it'd clear things up in my head. I'll tell you something, Jez, honestly ... I thought they were real.
I want to know. You tell me!
You wanna know? Turn on the T.V. Watch the fucking news!
Me neither.
It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
I don't know you.
I'm not upset.
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
You can have anything you want.
Don't be funny.
Sit down, Jake.
No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
The Ladder?
Never?
Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.
It's strong stuff.
Well that's good to know.
I would have stayed there if I could.
Please come quietly.
The army?
You come home with me.
Died?
No. No. It's okay. I'm okay.
Yes it does.
Oh, come on!
What if they're carrying? Did you even check?
Right now, I care only for the safety of this crew. You don't know anything about these two -
But I didn't see...
Guys!!! The shuttle?
You're doing fine. I won't let anything happen to you, remember?
Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
We wait. I need about fifteen. Call me if there are any changes. If she farts I want a full report.
I've waited long enough. Kay . . . you know what to do.
We're screwed.
He was chasing me!
Close the fucking door!
Remember to roll his balls around a bit.
A little late to be thinking about escape, isn't it?
Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
You need to get laid!
You killed him?
I love you.
We're missing two of the kids!
Thirty seconds.
Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
But...I...400 years?
Why don't you get it? He's going to kill us all!
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
You got it.
Two cases. And dinner when you land.
All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him...  ...along for ballast.
...'cause this is where he lives. You gotta think like they do.
We got a barrel on him. We can't lose him. We stay out here until we find him.
He's taken him!
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
I was only reacting to what I was told.
I don't know if I can do that without a...
Maybe we can save August...
Just sign it, Larry.
Hooper, Matt Hooper. From the Oceanographic Institute. 
Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught...
Rogue?
We gotta get back soon...
They must've hit something.
We will. There's something I've got to find out.
Some friends and me took a house.
I can't believe that people pay money to go fishing. This is really dumb. This isn't even relaxing... it's just boring.
Yep.
Take my car, okay?  You come with us, Lenny.
Let me see your hands...
Anti-Shark cage.
I'll see you at school, O.K.?
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
You're mad. Why are you mad?
Katrina's not my girlfriend! And I doubt she was actually giving you the stinkeye. She just looks like that all the time.
I still have your virginity!
Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
Did you hear it's yours?
No... I guess not.
No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno?
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
Well, I'm not ready to be a mom.
No, I mean in your pregnancy.
Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said I was twelve weeks.
Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
Shit, yeah. Close it up.
Geeeerta Rauuuss!
Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.
Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob.
I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
Like what?
Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
No, he's the dad.
Well, it can really only go two ways.
I know what junk is.
Yeah?
I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
Please. Dario Argento is the ultimate master of horror.
Frankly, this looks kind of stupid.
Here's to dovetailing interests.
My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross.
Why?
Consider it your musical education.
Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
It's just not working out, but I'm getting my own place in the city... and I've got it all planned out. It's something I've wanted to do for a long time...
Good. I'm good.  Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
Sure.
I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous.
Once! And she didn't die, if you recall!
You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
You mean like couples?
Yeah, like people in love.
Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
Dad, no!
Well, of course. Your old D-A-D! You know I'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.
Silencio! I just drank my weight in Sunny D. and I have to go, pronto.
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.
I know. Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.
Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch.
Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
And I disagree.
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
It's a loft.
There ain't nothing we could do. Once Early sets his mind on somethin', well thats the end of that.
Carrie.
That's not true!
Early, sing me a song.
...I don't know.
Not so good. You sure you have to?
I don't know. Wish I did.
What do you need a Bible for?
Forget it.
Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I can teach you everything ya need ta know.
They picked up hitchhikers... young men... and brought them back here.
Mmm... I love it when you talk like that.
Just like that. Load up the Lincoln... point it West... stop when we hit the fucking ocean.
...I think it's the best stuff I've done.
Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
Funny, very funny.
Up yours.
I don't want to talk about it.
Fuck!
Then try again, 
Oh, I don't know... I think that once I dye my hair blonde, buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan... I could be veggin' out with the best of 'em...  Like fer shurr!
Siesta.
I ain't got nothing against God. It's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. What are you looking for?
What is it?
Well now I'd say that's the least of Mr. Diebold's problems.
You're clean.
Did what take?
That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen.
What for? That guys a dick.
You think he's got any herb?
He lives on 76th?
Den less go Joe.
Yeah.
I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
He looks like my uncle.
She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her.
Bet.
Why I do what?
Shut the fuck up.
I don't know. How much do you want?
Nothen' B.
You goin'?
Yeah.
I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.
Yeah. Do it again.
Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
Yeah. Come on.
You have?
Yeah.
I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
Come on. You can rave on another night.
Yeah?
Come on.
But I'm scared Telly.
No, Fidget, I...
What do I want to do?
I don't know. I just think that you would love it.
Well, I don't mean to be a pest. It was just that I was looking at you. And you look upset. I liked looking at you, but your face looks upset. And I was wondering if I could be of any assistance? Maybe I could cheer you up or somethin. Help make you happy. Who knows? Somethin' maybe.
Are you in trouble with the law?
Well then, I don't know. You know what you do then? You forget. Block it out. I remember when I was a little boy. My grandmother told me to be happy. She said. She said, "Leon, my darling little grandson. If you want to be happy don't think. Don't bump into any walls. If you stutter. Don't talk" And I took her advice. And look at me now. Couldn't be happier.
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
Passion...
Mine?
And it's like. How much more can I bob here? You know.
No. I just gotta go find him.
Yeah?
Do you know where he went?
Yep.
Yep.
Oh shit.
But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?!
Yeah.
Did they ask you a lot of questions?
Yeah?
Nah.
Yep.
Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid.  Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please.
Yes.
Fine, don't ask me out on a date.
He says it's a game.  All games have a strategy.
If we knew that we'd know the answer to the riddle, wouldn't we?  He's telling us where he's going to kill tonight and we can't see it.
Fuck you!  I'm tired of your goddam accusations!  If you want to arrest me go ahead!  Otherwise back off.
Get off me!
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
Yes.  Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
Why did you write remember on the wall?
Not really.
Just like who?
You're not playing very well.  There are clues all around you and you keep missing them.
You heard me.  Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
What makes you think I was there?
You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
The police haven't told you?
Emotional?  I expected more from you.
If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.
Of course not.
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
Okay.  Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.
Set up some pieces on the big board?
Never mind.  He died two years ago.
New York.  1986.  Viktor Yurilivich.
The scars on your chest.  From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen.
Oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we?
He already did once.
Why did he what?
That's only because you don't know where to go.  You like hiking?  Fishing?  Sailing?  What do you like?
I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
Okay.
How long has she been dead?
That's great.
Well what?  I told you this was a stupid idea.  You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
It's important.
Call dispatch.  Double the patrols.  I want that area blanketed.
What did he mean by Huxley?
About a quarter to one.
Do you know how she found the apartment?
To my room and then I went for a walk.
"Is".  Did you tell him about the institute?
That's got to be it.
Answer the question.
This is insane!  Can't you see what's going on.  The killer wants me out of the way.  He's setting me up.
You're always in the middle of a match.
Just thought you might want to talk.
About what?
We'll call you back.
Sara, this is Doctor Sheppard.  I called you earlier about a book.
"Carefully".  "Carefully". "Carefully".
It's alright.
Uh huh.
Yes.
You sound like my mother.
Does what's going on bother you at all? Or are you just wearing your game face?
Let's change the subject.
Why?
No.  You were talking about chess.
It's alright.  It was a long time ago.
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
Would you settle for pepperoni?
I thought you said the line was busy?
What?
Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
Because she killed herself!!
Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
Of course not.
I got lucky.
Do we have a future?
I'm sure you are.
No, I want you to do good.  That way when I beat you at the end I'll look that much better.
Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.
In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
Colwyn ...
You have the power. <u>Will it</u>.
I won't leave you here.
You will not follow the Slayers, you will obey my command!  You have no chance alone, boy. You must try to break through to Ynyr. He has great knowledge. Only with his help can you save Lyssa.
I have lived in this place, like my fathers before me, guarding the old knowledge. I knew, when I had no son, that the Great War would come in my time, and that I would be the one to pass on the old knowledge to a new king. Come.
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
She is too deep. The curved tunnel we saw is part of the Vortex, the place of The Beast.
No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
Lyssa? <u>Why</u>?
The Beast will kill her.
Use your sword.
We must enter the swamp.
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
Yes.
I cannot take comfort when she has none.
Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?
Fame.
I compel no man to follow me on this journey.
Yes, my lord.
Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.
Naturally.
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
No.
Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ...  What?  Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air?  Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything.
And do you think I live on air?
We have plenty of hares.
Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.
The new King.
The Widow of the Web?
Tomorrow, the Fortress of Krull will rise with the sun in the Valley of Reeds. But the knowledge is of no use to you. No man has ever escaped the Web. And soon the creature will come for you, even here.
Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here.
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
Take them, you never know... If you want to have some fun. Take, it's a gift.
Perfect.
OK.
You were scared, weren't you?
Quick doesn't mean "ready". And you can't discuss, we said. Right?
I never rent my gear.
Of course, so kiss me quickly, or they'll notice us.
When I say I love you.
...OK.  I love you anyway.
Yeah... There's a lot on TV.
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend...
Three times, then two times.
...Yes.
No, no! I don't want to go!  I don't want!
I'm used to it.  Not everyone likes music.
...Composer.
Huh?
Huh? Why?
Ten dollars... A month.
Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
A couple days to a few months if untreated.
Are you and your friends planning on driving soon?
No, I just don't want anybody dying because I didn't say something when I had the chance.
It can, but it'll have to wait in line.
You're feeling old and you want to start exercising.  A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth.  Don't feel embarrassed about it.
We can do it together.
I don't follow.
What do you want from me?  Would I swim across an ocean for you?... Would I walk across the United States for you?  Yes... Yes I would.  You know that.
Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech.
Don't be so sure.
Pacifica, California.
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
Doubts?  About what?
This guy's not a murderer.
Oh no... I'm not good at that. Very bad in fact...
You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run.
Pulitzer, here I come.
She knew you loved her.
You were right.  From the heart is always better.
Forty-seven years.
He's getting my sweater from the car.  I said there was a breeze.  I told him not to go.
No.
We can go to one if you'd prefer.
I don't care about that. There's time left. You can have more money. You can drink all you want. You can talk or listen. Just stay, that's all I want.
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
Why should I? I know you're not a cop, so what is it tonight? Another two-fifty to watch you sleep?
No, I can't have dinner with you.
Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
Yes.
Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.
Sera you are crazy.
Because... it's better for me that way. OK?
Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling.
Yes... I'll give you that.
I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
With an old friend.
I don't need backups. Harvard is the school I'm going to.
You understand you're on trial for murder?
He was thirty-four years older than you. That doesn't sound so good to a jury.
Who?
Two a year since I was twelve. You do the math.
Because they got wet.
That's right. Because isn't the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance that you are forbidden to wet your hair for at least twenty-four hours after getting a perm at the risk of de-activating the ammonium thiglycolate?
Who's askin'?
Tell him, Paulette.
I'm a man who knows what I want.
He chose them already?
Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
How about --
What could I do?  He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me.
She could use some mascara and some serious highlights, but she's not completely unfortunate-looking.
No.
Of course I can believe it. You're going to make a great lawyer.
Relation?
Really? Thanks.
Serious?! Who the hell does he think he is? You're the most popular month on the USC calendar!
I have the highest GPA in Delta Gamma!
I can't believe you guys are actually here -- but this case is important. I'll make it up to you after finals, okay? I -- promise. I really want to do a good job.
Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability.
She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
Did you see the icky black color of her hair?
Gay men know designers. Straight men don't.
What're you talking about? You earned it --
Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more navy blue suits. No more panty- hose. No more trying to be something I'm not.
Are you sure?
Absolutely!
Why not?
I'd rather have a client who's innocent.
So are you!
I completely agree.
I'm seriously in love with you -- Isn't that enough?
I gave her my word, Warner.
Really?
Three months.
But I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke.
I mean, I know you're upset and all, but can't you just take a sedative?
Pull up next to him!
Faith.
I doubt the faeries will admire their beauty... Come, this will be fun to watch.
You go to lady now?
I speak of love, and you think only of the lash.
You... you're a beast!
We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it.
I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
Do it now!
Too bad your precious Jack can't hear you... the damsel in distress... A rescue attempt would be most amusing... We could flay sweet Jack alive as an after-dinner entertainment...
Don't please... I'll do what you desire...
What do you want from me?
It's nothing.  My men take great delight in routing the enemy.  Don't trouble yourself, beauty.
From the parapets most likely.  The men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving.
Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
Well, bygones're bygones, I always say.
There's a coil of golden thread fine as spider web yet naught can break it... and a silver key no lock can resist.
A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.
You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.
Are ye afraid of me wine?  Did your momma tell ye never to take food nor drink from the Wee Folk?  Think if ye sup with the faeries you'll be enchanted?
Big question that, lad.  Why what?
Aye.  That foul wallow be where Jenny Greenteeth dwells.  Oona... lure her out.  Play the part of a girl-child.
I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter.
Have we turned grave-robber, then?
Well then, you've got the sword and you've got the armor; all's lacking is the steed.
It would appear so.
Tricks, is it?  Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp!  I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk.
Track the demon to his lair.
Aye.  He's enchanted the lot of them.  His reward for delivering the unicorn.
Jack, Jack, it's dwarves live here. Hard-working chaps.  Hammering in the forge all the live-long day. Make the most wondrous things, they do.
Gump, you're putting words in my mouth.
Be gentle with them, Jack.  They only march to please you.  Were this a faerie journey, we'd ride the wind on thistledown and ragwort stems.
We'll surely be in our graves if we don't.
It bodes evil.
Stay on your guard, Jack.  The bug is enchanted surely.
Nay.  This time we strike first!
It's your own fear troubles you... We're here, aren't we?  For all the dark magic protecting it.
We do both.  Our frontal attack a diversion whilst we drive a tunnel under...
Don't loose heart... Assemble the archers.  Have everyone not holding a shield man a bow.  Shoot the damned things as they fly.
What magic have we on our side?
That's it!  The unbreakable line! We'll tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis... then, I'll climb up and chop down the drawbridge.
It doesn't matter.
Easily... The question is, can we save ourselves?  Be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war.
In the dark, lad?  Why should he do that?
Sunlight.
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
They've fired the moat!
A promise is a sacred oath.
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
My lady mocks me.
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
What?
No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!
And I... love you...
Everywhere!  Ow!
We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.
Is she fair, this princess?
Dead, dead, dead.
No need for bells, Jack.  I'll nay enchant ye.
I'd be honored.
Jest with me then.
I'm promised to another!
I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.
I think she's about to foal.
His honor, I suppose... seeing he no longer can defend it.
There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there.  Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.
A castle's but stone and mortar --
Nay.  Castle Couer de Noir is Devil's work... built with sorrow and grief...
Mom said I should.
I don't think Dad wants you home.
Here, honey!
I'm supposed to be mad at you, but I'm not.
No.
Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys.  I hate nose rings.  And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.
Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
I'm living here while I build another house.
What's that?
Hi.
Turn over.
No thanks.
It's freakish.  I don't get it.  I'm not really supposed to touch you, but I can look.
It would help me if I could kiss you.
No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
What?
He's not the type to worry.
Will he talk to me?
No.
I mean, but did you both go camping on weekends?  Listen to music?  Masturbate together?  Talk on the phone?
He builds models for architects.  His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal.  Designed and built the coolest houses I've ever seen.
And if I enclosed it?
To the patio and one north-facing window...  And six inches to the height.
Pardon me?
Oh...nothing.  Thirty pounds.  I just haven't been very hungry.
How's your wife?
When we divorce a decade ago, she was very, very angry.  Now she's just hostile.
Maybe that's too long.
Forty.
Thank you.
Uh huh.
I'm sorry.
My life is a warning.  I just can't figure out for what.
You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
You'll know me by the time we're through.
Get the inkling, Sam.  I'm getting tired of your attitude.
You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out?
You'll have money when you work.
I can promise you complete privacy.
I don't know.
A friend of yours is here.
I won't ever hit you.  I don't want you smaller.  I want you to be happy.  You're not.  Not here with me. Not home with your mother.  Not up in Tahoe.  Not alone.  Not anywhere.  You're what I was most of my life, Sam. I see it in your eyes.  In your sleep. In your answer to everything.  You're barely alive.
I know.  Why?
She seemed upset.
You lied to me!
I would have lied to me if I thought I'd believe it.
I'd build a house.
A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to.
Do you know what I'd give to have this! Forget how I got it!  I can't afford dirt in this town.  I live in Riverside, Goddammitt  And you get to piss in the ocean.
Thanks for telling me.
I don't let him.  He just loves to.
I was parked in day parking.
When's school over?
No, you don't.  Trust me.
That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
Oh...with his ear infection!
How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that?
If I weren't married?
What?
It's not my back that's killing me.
Not a perfect day.
I'd be you.
What?
I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks.  Sam's working.  I told you Sam was working.  I mean, he really is.
We haven't been away together for three years.  What difference does a few months make?
This is what he wants.
He'll be gone for his birthday.
Yes, it is.
Cost you a pair of nylons.
You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I mentioned you both. But the fact is, pardons don't come cheap. The kid can hit. What can you do?
Sharp.
Real nice guy, too. Trumpet player. They moved down to New Orleans.
I know she's sorry she won't be seeing you anymore. Anyway, she wanted me to take care of you.
That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
He's right, Gibson. Put down the gun and we'll work this out.
I'm not your boss. Not anymore.
A job, huh? Well, that's nice, real nice. You won't have to work long. I'll be back soon enough. After I start work at First Federal Bank of Manhattan, I'll be keeping you in style. Everything will get back to normal again. That's a promise.
Nothing.
You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.
Looks like a fake to me. Loan denied!
Still got that ten dollars?
Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails.
You know what I'm saying.
What do you know about boats? I bet you can't even swim.
Why are you always talking about we? There is no we. There is a me, there is a you. But there is no we between us.
You know what, Claude? This whole time we've been down here, you've done nothing but think about yourself, acting like this whole thing is my fault. That plan with your cousin, did that include me?
What am I gonna eat?
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
So, Blocker, what do you think of our boy?
Well, if that's the way it is...
I hope you don't think I owe you anything. Because I don't owe you a damn thing.
You haven't driven in 40 years, you ain't even got a license. Man's taking his life in his hands, putting you behind the wheel! Where you taking him?
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here.  We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
Hey, there's Wilkins!
He's got my daddy's watch, Claude. I always knew whoever took that watch killed Winston Hancock. And that was you, Mr. Pike.
Don't call me soft, I hate it when you call me that.
'Course I was right. About what?
I'm all right.
You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.
Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.
Those are for trusties, unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs.
Made just for you, Cookie.
Listen up, jiggaboo! State of Mississippi ain't interested in your... in your...  metropolitan assets!
1932? That's like, that's like...
Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
It'll be too late.
I prefer bourbon.
Thank you, Claude. That'll be all for tonight.
Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
Jenny?
You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
What are you in for, Willie?
That's a long story...
Please, get out of my mind!
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
Urr... uggg... errr...
I'm calling you out, brother...
Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel.
Well tell her I said "hi" back.
That turn you on there, RuPaul?
Put it in your mouth.
Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.
But those are my roommate's sodas...
"But those are my roommate's sodas..." Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make?
I'm just saying, there's wickedness in you... I can tell from your snores.
Now you're talking.
Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
I'm too weak. The process has already begun.
You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.
I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
You smell like coconuts.
No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
You think I'm a tourist?
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
Sometimes, sure.
I... I don't know why I just said that. I meant to say that...
Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.
That was Cassius!
I love you.
Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?
A black guy?
If it's Cassius, yes.
I feel sorry for you, boy!
No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
Your turn.
You're a beautiful pair.
There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's --
Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
That's better.  How do you want us?
Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
What other food?
Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea.  It's all here -- ready -- fresh as harvest day. Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea... And then it stopped coming and they...  ...came instead. So I store them here. I'm ready. And you're ready. It's my Job -- protein, plankton, grass from the sea.
Fine... Holly will get you ready. You're in good hands, believe me.
I don't care... Just get it over with.
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do.
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
I'm very smart.
Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
Killed? Why do you use that word?
Jessica.
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
No.
No.
But you put yourself on the circuit!
And?
About what?
Not about that.
You shouldn't even think such things...  And you picked a strange person to say them to --
So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for renewal.
You know.
A Runner gave it to me.
You're not going, are you?
Some people say children need human mothering.
Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
They're watching us now. They'll let us in when they're sure.
It's the only way.
Ycch.  To kill things and then eat them. It must have been a savage world.
We'll be all right...  We will...
Sooner or later, we'll have to try something.
Of course.
It could be...
To what?
Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
Beloved wife...
Yes...
Hello.
Just a place, I suppose... who knows?
Never, never, ever. Nothing.
What a pity. I was hoping you'd be here to bury me.
Thank you.  Tell me -- what do those words mean? "Beloved husband"... "Beloved son"... "Beloved wife"...
My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together.
Yeah.
Right... This just glided along.
I think he suspects something... We have to be careful... I miss you.
I'll call you again.
Meet me at the Starlight Motel on Sycamore... I'll be there in twenty minutes.
We should stop seeing each other.
It was a long time ago... I met someone at this place called Moke's... we became friends. He told me about a job...
Up the stairs - down the hall.
Dick Laurent?
The night before you showed up in the slammer...
Sit down a minute.
Yeah? what did they want?
His physical condition.
Out in back.
You talk to him?
No... Here he comes.
You came home. Your friend Sheila brought you here.
We'll get a tail put on him.
No, sir, it's not.
When he went to work, right.
My... My head.
I thought I'd stay home and read.
That's why I married you.
Yeah?
I guess so.
All right.
What?
But...
No... of course not.
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
I don't remember... What happened that night?
You really don't remember?
You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is.
Go home, Sheila.
Uh-huh.
Not at all.
Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.
I see.
I see.
Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
I'm never conversational before I coffee.
Yes.
Well, you just reverse it. Your left hand is  What difference does it make what 'hand' you are? The north is the north!
Of course. That's what I told them last night. You can't expect a man to sail around in the dark.[5] During this George has been looking around - he rises.
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
As a matter of fact, I'm very good at double solitaire.
You are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and I, for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.
You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
And be poisoned out here in the open?
Come on, Lovey.
Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?
When are you going to start?
I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business
All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
So there are others?
Oh, good heavens, no!
Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?
Well, it must have taken
Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?
Of course we have no money as you know it. We do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because, well, because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it.
Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . .
Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
Well, they didn't actually mean that.
Yes, charming.
Amazing!  She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!
Yes.
He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!  Oh George, you must take me with you!
Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!
Hey!
Yes.
But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.
You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
Hello? Colonel?
You?
Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. They don't count.
What do you mean if we should get out?
Stay here?!  What's the matter with you, Bob? You've been acting strangely ever since we came here.  I've never seen you like this. Why can't we leave? What's stopping us?
Oh, George . . .
Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
What do you mean - "fade away like an echo"?
You're wrong, George.
I'm not wrong. She told me so. Besides, she wouldn't have to tell me. I'd know anyway.  I found out a lot of things last night.  I'm not ashamed of it either. It's probably one of the few decent things that's ever happened in this hellish place.
Yes, everything!
Can't you shut up? Must you go on babbling like an idiot?
In for what?
What do you suggest?
My name's Sondra.
Oh, I know. It was full of this and full of that. But you were accomplishing nothing. You were going nowhere, and you knew it.
Struggling, why?
I don't know. I'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary.
Perhaps.
Please say you will. The days are so very long and lonely without you.  Please . . .
of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually ONE GUY and--
It's not even a fucking door.
You got smeared.
And if I say yes?
We're the government, Cowan.
No. But You'll get used to it.    Welcome to the Men in Black.
Three, huh?  Really? Cause a cup of coffee says we're talking about... number... four?  Huh?  No?
Dee, you've been useful for 50 years.  We're clueless, you're tired. Why don't you go home and get some rest.
She didn't even know you. .
Hey, I was workin' her.  I was workin' my thing.
I taught kindergarten.
History's proven that where there's a nitrogenizer, there's a 12-legged signazoid.  They use it to make our food digestible for their systems.
There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia.  I take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
Why did Mikey leave Nazca?
No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards.
We're rising.
I dunno, man.  Maybe we should.
I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
Everything left the planet, right? Except one thing.    That little insect-- the one we found in Sudbury.  Did it leave when everything else left?
Getting eaten!? That was your plan!?
You know, there's something we never really thought of...
I'd prefer if you were just a little more blunt.
Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
Do have any idea what I just said?
It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
Yeah, wall, you know, I was just going there... to pick then up.
Nothing.
Tell us the truth.  You don't just find these things, at least not in this neighborhood.
What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
Where's he making his big speech?
A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
What?
Forget that guy --
I can't leave.  You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future.
Someplace safe.
You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
Then who was he?
Somewhere.
Anne Lively...
And replace them with new ones.
Oh, yes.
Lara --
What?
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
That was easy.
Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
Yes, it is.
Then why can't they see rapes, or assaults... or suicides?
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.
Possession alone will cost you six months, not to mention your badge.
Wally.  This is Danny Witwer.  He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.
Oh... Hi, John.
I need your help.
Well, hey, you didn't have to come all the way down here.  For you, Chief, I make housecalls...
Rufus.  She's a precog.
C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
You gotta have faith, Dad.
What the hell.
No.  He got tired of pretending.
I'm your son.  I'm you.
He's alive?
Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.
Why?
Hold that thought.
I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
He's dead, Lara.
Lara, I don't know why this is happening.  I just know they're setting me up.  I can't trust anybody.  I don't know who to talk to or where to go...  Lara?  Are you there?
I don't know who that is.
Tell him not now.
Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
Wait, just a second...
I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
I wanna kill my boss.
That's the Red Ball Alarm.
They're everywhere.
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
None.  This was arranged.
I think you're swell company, Knott.
Knott!
You "friend's" a murderer and he ruined our perfect record.  Six years, not one damn murder...
How can you even tell?  You know how blind you are without your glasses.
But I've seen the three hundred hours of your image he's got stored away.
What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today.
No thank you.
You sure? I just made it.
Phone, room service, mini-bar. Any additional expense. If you need anything you can push the button marked 'Concierge', and they'll be able to help you.
All the suites are about the same.
Come on. Just tell me. It'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms.
Women?
You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
Should I fuck him?
I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did.
He's not doing it.
You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti
I want spaghettis.
No.
She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.
Well, that's not gonna happen.
Ho's a good guy --
I want you to take her with you.
Come on, dude. The other chick's giving my best man a blow job in the toilet. I know the drill, I'll wear a rubber --
A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
Yeah.
A million. Easy.
Yeah.
He'll work it off.
Take a few days --
Hi. I'm Jimmy.
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
Soho.
So?
It's not losing record.
I'll page you.
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
He implied it.
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
It's not even yours.
I like it.
Shhh...  Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there.  You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
Maybe we should call for a cab.
Yeah. He said that's our account with the car service.
What are you doing?
They asked who it was.
This is bullshit, man.
You got something to say --
Yeah, but you know Horrace. What did you get off him?
So we're working?
It's not a 'sit down.' He said he's telling us the plan.
I got a bad feeling, man. I don't want to go in naked.
You want us strapped, don't you?
The penguin house.
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
No more, man.
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
Bobby and Ricky.
Right, right. The 'thugs.'
Fuck...
That's a good idea, maybe I will!
The line's over there.
Cardiff Giant. Just check.
Yes.
Jimmy knows. 13th Street. We'll meet you there.
Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
'Strapped?'
I'll tell him someone else told me.
You know my pager number?
Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.
Go ahead. Open the fuckin things. You should each find fifteen hundred --
Yes. You're going to New York.
And where do we bring it?
What?
Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?
And where might that be?
I am.
Yeah. This shit's fucking brilliant. I just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. I gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. It's illegal back home, you know.
Where I come from. Boston.
How 'bout that?
Lemme write it down for you.
Just now.
I'm working on it.
I'm there, daddy. Wheww. I'm cool enough to kill.
I don't want your money.
That really you, Red?
You could of been something, Archie, but the devil got to you.
You putting a hurtin' on my vision.
What you say?
Don't con me.
I'm telling you God's words, not no hustle. I'm talking the words of Elijah, the black man's God. I'm telling you, boy, that God is black.
Man, how'm I gonna know the ones worth looking at?
Read it and keep on reading.
Lemme tell you about history: black history. You listening?
The first men on earth were black. They ruled and there was not one white face anywhere. But they teach us that we lived in caves and swung from trees. Black men were never like that.
Who are you?
-- the hardest and the greatest.
I don't know how.
You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
I want to. God knows I want to.
Mr. X, I won't make you out a liar.
Has the Reverend called? Is he going to show?
They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
Why do you ask?
Just hold me.
Hush your mouth.
The talk is everywhere!
We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more.
Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
Open your eyes, you can face death 24 hours a day; but the possibility of betrayal never enters your mind. If you won't do that for yourself do it for us.
Dear heart, where are you?
At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
I don't want folks to be searched, it makes people uncomfortable. If I can't be safe among my own kind, where can I be? Allah will protect me.
Just what is your question?
What color were the original Hebrews?
But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
I'm not saying anything, preacher. I'm proving to you that God is black.
Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate?
Women are deceitful. They are untrustworthy flesh. I've seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by women.
Let me do it then.
Sure, man.
Are you Elijah's pimp?
Say what you're saying.
Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of Lucky's.
The sentences to run concurrently.
I'm going to bed. I gotta work tomorrow, need my rest.
Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.
All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love y'all.
I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.
What's your story, baby?
Shorty, this is Laura.
I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna be Bogart sometimes.
You're too small to be Bogart.
Man, the name musicians ain't got shit. How you gonna have something? I need a stake, a bundle, a grand. My woman can't afford it; my homey ain't got it. How about you baby? What you got?
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
What can you do?
Jesus Christ, no. Okay, okay. You got it, you got it! You're the boss.
Yes sir.
I was special. The only colored kid in class. I became a sort of mascot. Like a pink poodle.
I show, you give me the information?
[What is his name?]
[We have an ATM bank card. We draw out 300 dollars every two weeks.]
[The number you use at the bank machine.]
[Who killed her? You?]
[The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]
[No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.]
[Where do I find him?]
[I believe you.]
[Lucky how?]
[There was no ten million dollars.]
[The ransom was ten.]
[No. Whoever took the rest took it before the exchange.]
No. And no one is to know of your drinking problem. That includes my wife.
Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse.
You got tossed. Don't trust the cops, especially the Judicials.  Oh you know that?
Maybe...
Yes or no?
Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
Do you think he'll come back?
Where?
How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules.
I don't understand.
It's no wonder you're late. Why didn't she just come with you?
The gunshot holds no fear.
You welcome the sound. The sound is what lets you go. The sound is what frees you. You are a prisoner in those blocks until you hear the sound.
There's no such thing as tough. You're either trained or untrained.
Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that.
I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.
The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.
It's Creasy.
Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included.
Do you know what she told me last night?
Yeah? And if she was ugly?
Don't forget your towel.
I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
These people are professionals. They don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.
Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
He has to go.
She's young. She'll get over it.
[It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.]
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
I already ate.
I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
Two tourists who never went home.
Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead.
And they took that away.
A man can be an artist in anything. Stone, paint, words. Food. Anything if his soul is true to it. Creasy's art is death. And he's about to paint his masterpiece.
Listen. You people go grab a table. I'll be back inna minute. I'll be right back.
My mother, boy, she drives me crazy.
You want me to ride down with you?
Where you going?
You got me mad, that's why. Hey, Joe, show Marty that picture.
He was here last night till about two o'clock. I hear you really got stuck with a dog last night.
That's my son Thomas's baby.
You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...
What they say?
Yeah.
I'm thirty-four.
Benjamin Franklin High School.
I'm afraid of being lonely.
Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll make friends right away.
No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.
Sure. Just take off your coat a minute.
Please...
I'll call you up tomorrow morning. Maybe, we'll go see a movie.
Okay.
Goodnight.
What?
You can't just walk off onna girl like that.
Sooner or later, there comes a point in a man's life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact I gotta face is that whatever it is that women like, I ain't got it. I chased enough girls in my life. I went to enough dances. I got hurt enough. I don't wanna get hurt no more. I just called a girl just now, and I got a real brush-off, boy. I figured I was past the point of being hurt, but that hurt. Some stupid woman who I didn't even wanna call up. She gave me the brush. I don't wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like I was a bug. I got feelings, you know. I had enough pain. No, thank you.
Marty...
Put on your blue suit...
We just got here about fifteen minutes ago. Ma, I want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder. She's graduate of New York University. She teaches chemistry in Benjamin Franklin High School.
I offered her, Ma, she don't want nothing.
She's twenty-nine, Ma.
The nurses Leo and me picked up last night. We got a date with them tonight.
I can't do that, Ralph, because somebody already brushed her off once tonight.
Oh man, you shoulda come with us last night, Marty. That one for you was a real lunatic. How'd you make out?
Siddown, Thomas, siddown.
I'm gonna see you tonight...
I don't care about the intention. I just know your Cross Action is a plus on our side. I've seen it come through four times.
They give you copies to burn.
Sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.
That's right.
The door, Frank, the door! Where you from anyhow, Alaska?
Duke Forrest.
The spot we picked to spend the winter. Maybe we ought to look a little harder.
He can't take much more time on the table.
Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice.  It's a different ritual but it works the same.
Good thinking, Duke. How about it, Ho-Jon? Can you round up a few of the boys?
I worked with Spearchucker my first month over here, at the 72nd Evac in Taegu. Most of the colored guys know who he is but they're not talking because he asked them not to.
You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
You betcher ass, General.
I though you said we didn't have a drop.
Part of him. Painless is the owner and operator of the Pride of Hamtrack. That's where he comes from... Hamtrack, Michigan.
The black capsule. Finest kind. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.
Oh, Jesus.
I don't get it.
We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
We can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones.
I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them.
And his track record, that don't count? Look, honey, when you watch the two shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss.
That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game. He had one year with the Rams before the Army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs.
We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.
No trouble at all.  Hawkeye.
How did you get called that?
Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
Don Juanism is just a cover... I've been reading up on it.  I'm a fake, I'm a fraud, I've been living a lie!
Just in dreams?
Well, I'm sure my colleagues will agree there are a number of dependable measures for extinguishing the vital forces.
You guys got any black capsules?
Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through.
You can cut the bow.
He's comin' this-a-way! The jaw- breaker!
Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
One of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight?
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
What's that, Henry?
It's a technique Ugly John and I worked out in case something like this came up.
Yeah. Lavender and old lace!
Are you all right?
Um-hum.
Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.
Well, all those guys in the bleachers think
Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?
Who?
Well, you got your circulation. Now, why don't you let me alone?
Me?
Uh-huh.
About me?
Yeah, that's the one.
Huh? Oh, yes. Let's go.  Now, let's see. We want some action in these pictures.
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the houseand then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and
The Websters.
Sure!  When you get hold of a stunt that sells papers you don't drop it like a hot potato. Why, this is good for at least a couple of months. You know what I'd do? Between now and let's say, Christmas, when he's gonna jump, I'd run a daily yarn starting with his boyhood, his schooling, his first job!  A wide-eyed youngster facing a chaotic world. The problem of the average man, of all the John Does in the world.
Who, for instance?
Oh.
We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel roomunder bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him.  Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
Well, what about it?  Let them see him!  We'll go them one better. They can also hear him.  You own a radio station, Mr. Norton. Why not put him on the air?
Thank you.
Have you seen him?
I know why you're hangin' aroundyou're stuck on a girlthat's all a guy needs is to get hooked up with a woman.
Just like you said on the radio, Mr. Doe.
Old man Delaney has been bringing his furniture over to my place at night, one piece at a time, and selling it.
Aw, Long John . . . I tell youit's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither! 
You bet I will! As fast as I can! Gonna get some canned goodsa fishing rod, and the rest I'm gonna give away.
Better make it doughnuts, huh?
Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does!  Wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!
I want it as soon as possible.
Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my way around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty.
Okay, Beany, bring 'em in one at a time.  Wipe to: Montage: Half a dozen different types of hoboes appearand in each instance ANN shakes her head, negatively.
That's got nothing to do with it!
Ah, you bet your life you didn't! You look in your papers, ladies and gentlemen, and you'll find Miss Mitchell's signed confession that she was the one that wrote it!
Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started
I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
Oh!
Good night, John.
Yeah, yeah, but look, Mrs. Mitchell, you know I love Ann and it's gonna be awfully hard for me to say it because, well, you know, she's so wonderful, and, well, the best I ever was was a bush-league pitcher.
No, sir.
He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
"Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.
You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
Am I gettin' the car?
I what?
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
Is that all?
I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.
How do you feel after a shooting.
SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
I know.
With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married.
She grow up in Livingtston, too?
Yeah, well that's a sore subject, and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiator under my tutelage.
I think I can handle that one.
So what do I say to this guy?
Okay, stop.
I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
You're right. I'll never be as good a liar as you.
About six years. My partner took me.
I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.  It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
She's the one to blame. Not me.
Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
My name's Scott Roper.
Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
Did you know he's already got a bad knee? In another 10 years you're going to be pushing him around in a wheelchair.
You think I didn't need you?
You got a bet on the game tonight?
No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
Scottie...
Veronica, it's not easy for me... I don't know if I can change overnight. But what I'm telling you is that I want to share everything with you, because I don't ever want to be without you again.
I've been thinking.
You thought I was talking about getting married?!
What do you think would be in order?
Kimura and Glass will head the investigation.
32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. A unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside.
What have you promised them?
Come on!
I need to take back what's mine.
-- Because there'll be no remorse. Not in my world.
No...
True.  But why?
So wrong --
Yes.
It's his nature.
Sorry, I just design the maze.  Keeping the keys secure is your job.
-- I saw the program.
-- Come on, you know F.C.O. regs. Anyone caught with their R and D hand in the bio-digitization cookie jar spends the rest of their life in federal penitentiary.  It's not worth it.
It's not used for anything.
Good question.
Try harder.
There was no need to kill her.
What are you talking about?
Night City.
That's not possible.  No one can do that.
Yes.
I know.
Not you.  A copy.
Sorry?!
There was no other choice.
There?
Resurrection.
-- Standard.
Resurrection.

Wait a second...  What time is it?
Billy, that's BRILLIANT!
... Perhaps there is a way... I have heard tales of another power.
What?!
Ah... sure.
Stylin'!
WHITE TIGER!
Where did it originate?
Release the power with the power.
Ditto for the Swooping Swallow.
There's enough for everybody!
What kind of landing was that?! These clowns are a menace to the sky
You want me to place a few calls?
But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.
When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
But from now on it's Lucky's spot.
I guess I am. Just a little.
Could we step outside?
When you're investigatin', how long ya keep at it?
We got our boys paintin' the house next door. Around the clock. We're gonna keep old man Profaci alive if it takes twenty coats.
Why ya always gotta go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?
I was calling yesterday.
You got something to hide?
London?
It always is.
So what is the problem?
I'll talk to Nucky. Get you set up like the fuckin' Prince of Wales.
Good. 'Cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money.
Come off it, Bugs.
They don't give a shit about us!
You tryin' ta tell me something? I don't come to a meet with a weapon unless it's with an enemy.
Wassa matter, Mr. Big Shot. Don't have time for my business no more?
I know about you.
Didn't know you felt that way.
And I got it all planned.
I must know more of you, my son.
He's the Boss of all the Bosses, and I respect him.
Share with them as you wish. Do business with them on your own. But no filthy Jew will ever be a brother to me.
I found that out.
Masseria's been after me too.
Shuddup.
I don't know. I guess it was...
He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years. The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting... <i></i> That boy looked like pluperfect hell.
They had a case like that at Johns Hopkins. Wires got crossed between hands and feet.

<u>Why</u>??

Back? You're sending me back?
It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right?
Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...
Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta <u>strike</u>. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!
Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
It's a special kind of party. A <u>farewell</u> party. Do you...get what I'm saying?
You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
Sorry, Stu. It's all part of the deal. We've got <u>big plans</u> for that body of yours!
I had to park two blocks away. Is something -
But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
What's the "bad" part?
<i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!
An hour ago. <i></i> I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he would be like, like <u>this</u>. I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay?
Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--
I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass.
Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
Mr. Hypnos, you run this place. I'm begging you. There's gotta be something I can do.
Have a nice day.
I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village.  I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night.
I'm good.
I don't want to talk about it.
That's not true.  Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York.
Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?
If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it.
Goodbye, sweetheart.
So, you come here all by yourself?
Uh, yes.  My husband passed away recently ...
Forty-five?  I thought it was only supposed to be thirty?
Oh, yes--they're fine people--regular people.
All the ex-vice-Presidents. You can get ten-to-one around here if you think you can remember their names. The Vice-President presides over the Senate--you know that. It's how he earns his pay. Oh--over there, Senator-- on the east side of the Chair we still have the old snuff boxes with real snuff in them if you like snuff.
Never.
You are saying, in effect, that this is a forgery?
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and--? But *no*--I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.
That old standing offer from Diz Moore--Poet of Washington Correspondents.
No--don't do it. I'm sure. The truth is, Diz--there's no man I've seen yet or--must be something wrong with me. I've been feeling low for weeks.
Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!
Oh, you mean--Puss in Boots.
I don't mind *who* gets licked in a *fair* fight, Diz. It's these clouts below the belt I can't take. Sicking that horrible dame on him--when he's goofy about her--
Paine.
Yeah.
Diz--
Any time.
Tonight?
You--you've been a good egg, Diz. Maybe we could clear out of this town--get to feel like *people*--get the habit of lifting up our eyes-- live like we just got out of a tunnel.
My first name's--Clarissa.
I'm getting out of there. Right now, Diz. Right now. Bonus or no bonus. I'm gonna clear outa that office-- everything I own--my extra hat-- everything--
I've told you ten times--if I had anything they couldn't bat down in a second, don't you suppose I'd've been up in that hearing yelling murder! Sure--he was cooked the night I sounded off like a fool and spilled the whole works!
What!
Whom are you calling--in the dead of night?
Now, now, Emma, dear--you mustn't forget we have been chosen by the people of this commonwealth to--
For instance, how to run the affairs of government? No doubt my children could make this appointment *for* me-- with the greatest ease!
You'll see those committees when we're finished!
Yes, Jim.
Y-yes, Jim.
Oh, a *boy*!
Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?
Why, of course.
I beg your pardon?
The *Bills*? Jeff--let me advise you-- as your father would--politics is a business--sometimes a cruel business. In your time here, you couldn't even start on those Bills. They're put together by legal minds--after a long study. Why, after twenty years, I can't understand half of them myself. No, really, Jeff--in your own interests--
Jeff, look--didn't you say something to the papers about wanting to create a National Boys' camp? Were you in earnest about that?
Well, why not do it? There's a job for you. Get a Bill started to accomplish it--present it to Congress-- it would be a great experience--
Will he yield for a question?
Does my colleague's piece concern Section Forty of the bill--a dam on Willet Creek?
I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
Jefferson--
Certainly would, Joseph.
Well now--just to take an example-- putting up a dam--on Willet Creek. As I look at it--that dam's going to do the people of our state a lot of good--
Pleased to meet you, sir.
Tonight.  Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be complaining, Senator--but in all civilized countries, there's an institution called *dinner*--!
Some committee's got it.
What?
The Steering Committee.
He did?
Since sixteen or so.
But--I mean--for a woman--And--you've done awfully well--
I don't see where we are *with* it.
Must have been tickled pink.
And you're writing Ma all about it. And your pigeons will carry the message of love. And the first thing you know--Susan Paine'll get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted!
That's funny. I thought all along--  Gee--I--I'm glad to see you. I *thought* of you--I mean--I wanted to talk to someone and--well--  --Mr. Lincoln hasn't much to say--  Saunders--I'm not fit to sit up in the Senate--haven't you heard?--I robbed boys of their pennies and dimes!
The truth! Well, the man wants the truth! "What *is* truth?" asked so-and-so, and turned away!
It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.
How'd you like a punch in the nose?
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
That's dynamite, Joe!
Tomorrow! Joe--he'll hear the section on Willet Dam. He can't be there!
Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor.
Look, Senator--I wasn't given a brain just to tell a Boy Ranger what time it is. What do you need me for? Get somebody else--get a registered nurse--
And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks--
So I go right back where I was-- carrying compromises--covering up-- back to political tricks--this time for--! No! I was just getting rid of all that. If I did *anything*, I ought to go and tell him to stand up and--. No! I don't want any part of it! Smith or anything else! I'm all through. I want to be left alone!
A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.
Just a minute, Joe!
Keep doing it! This is the whole works, Joe--we're out of business of bigger than we then we ever were. We can't miss a trick--we can't stop at *anything*--till this yokel's smashed up and buried so deep he'll never--!
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
And Honest Abe's ideals. A rare man-- these days.
Senator Paine.
Order!
Finally, there was only one answer to a man like him--the truth--which I rose and gave to this body!  Mr. President--he has told lie upon lie--every lie a desperate attempt to conceal his own guilt. And now, he is trying to blackmail this Senate-- as he tried to blackmail me! To prevent his expulsion, he would probably even try to hold up this Deficiency Bill--vital to the whole country--which must be passed immediately--*today*! *Anything*--to force you to clear his bad name and save his hide!  Gentlemen--I--I have no more patience with this--this *rascally* character. I apologize to this body for his appointment--I regret I had ever known him. I--I'm sick and tired of this contemptible young man and I refuse to listen to him any longer! I hope every member of this body feels as I do!
Any children?
No, no children.
Are these the articles?
Are they true!
NO!!
What's that got to do with it?
You are , aren't you?
No. That is, I didn't  Until I met you. I like talking to you, though  Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.
Really?
Huh?  Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.
What are they going to do?
Uh-huh.
To most people, it's an awful letdown.
You must have met a lot of swell society girls since you've been here. Don't you like them?
He did? I play the tuba
Yeah, I know.
Yes, here we are again.  Good night.
I can't write it, Mabel! I don't know what's the matter with me.
Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh. To us he looks like a freak. You know what he told me tonight? He said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms.
Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
Hello.
Marvelous!  "At two o'clock this morning, Mr. Deeds tied up traffic while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse. When asked why he was doing it, he replied: 'I just wanted to see how many doughnuts this horse would eat before he'd ask for a cup of coffee.'"  Beautiful! What happened after that?
You'll get it, Babe. You'll get it.
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
Aw, listen Babe, I can't let you quit now. You're not going through with this thing, are you?
Yes, but you said
Fine. I'll talk to her. Give me the phone, quick. She's the only one I'm going to talk to from now on.
Yes, sir.
Fourteen carat?
Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane. Now, will you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?
Proceed.
Yes. You see, rich people need someone to keep the crowds away. The world's full of pests. Then there's the newspapers to handle. One must know when to seek publicity - and when to avoid it.
Mandrake Falls.  M-A-N
Okay, then. Go to it.  And, Charlie
Okay.
Are your parents living?
Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
Buffer?
You're going to New York with us.
No, thank you.
Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet.
Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.
Yes, indeed. I wonder why he left me all that money? I don't need it.
Why should you?
Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
Me?!
Well, thanks, I - uh  How do you do? What is your name?
Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.
Why, I turned them down, naturally.
I say we don't want to appear greedy.
No use in getting tough. That'll get you nowhere, Mr. Deeds.  You know, we've got letters.
Personally, I don't know what Mr. Cedar's raving about. From what I can see, no matter what system of government we have, there will always be leaders and always be followers.
Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
I write poetry.
Uh-huh.
Oh, the poet? Where?
I'd kind of like to see Grant's Tomb - and the Statue of Liberty.
Yes. I mean the real McCoy. Listen, you play saloon with me, and I'll introduce you to every wit, every nit-wit, and every half-wit in New York. We'll go on a twister that'll make Omar the soused philosopher of Persia[7] look like an anemic on a goat's milk diet.
Don't pay any attention to her.
South Dakota - but on the top.
Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
You're Walter, aren't you?
Oh, don't be silly, Walter. I couldn't walk around in the streets without any clothes. I'd be arrested.
What, sir?
An hour? What's an hour! You know how time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it.
Good kids.
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
One hundred books?
-- When I was in high school, the thing I wanted most, when I was stuck in class, the thing I was always desperately in pursuit of -- was a hall pass. That's all I wanted. I loved moving freely around the school while everybody else was trapped in there... And that's how I feel right now... Like I have some giant, all- day hall pass.
Mr. Cook.
Not any more.
It could happen. What about his state certification exams? The records seem to be in order.
How do you mean?
And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  There is good news, though.
Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.
Why not?
Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you --
-- 'cause in that instant I saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and I knew --
You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.
Go to hell.
Now we're back on track.
What exactly is it supposed to do?
My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State Certification Board.
Sorry I'm late... traffic was a motherfucker. Have another drink, I'll be back in five.
I do.
It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
You do?
You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
Oh, I don't know...
Lily, I don't think even you could know that --
Horror show. What'd you do tonight?
...And?
Why do you watch?
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love.
And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope.
I just got my license two weeks ago.
You're good.
Is she a friend of yours?
Mumford... like the town?
Do you think that's a good idea?
I think you do.
Why don't you tell me?
Take a hike, Dr. Quack!
I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.
I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.
She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time.  It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about.
Really? What would it take?
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
It's pretty obvious to a trained professional.
That's what I like.
Transference.
Which show was that?
You're not the only one...
Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
I want to spend the rest of my life with you... but I'm not sure you feel the same way.
What do you mean, "in no time"?
Just chill for a second. Look at this guy, it appears he's actually dead... but gorgeous.
If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
Of course! That's exactly what I want.
No, no... I have three billion dollars.
Don't you like this?
Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
Good-looking woman.
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
Yep.
Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
A doll?
Sounds like kind of a good idea.
Holy shit!
See you Thursday... regular time.
This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
What?
I don't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport.
I don't have one really. Most of the time I'm faking it. See, I think there's not much that can be done about most problems... they're too complicated, too deep-rooted by the time I hear about them. The most I can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got. If I can get a sense of that, well then, maybe... just maybe, I can help them out a little.
In the desert? What for?
Unfortunately no, these Americans are smart, they pay me only half now, half when I get them back to Cairo, so I must go all the way.
'Cause I look good doin, it.
What friend? You're my only friend.
Who needs smart women? I put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons, Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this mess!
Do you truly wish to know? Or would you prefer to just shoot us?
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
Correct, And that's when --
If we want to kill the creature, yes.
I have come to protect my investment, thank you very much.
What did you find? What did you see?
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
Are you sure?
Why would I do that?
You dream about dead guys?
It's everybody's problem!
He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
That just makes you more gullible.
Still...
What are you going to do? Shoot him?
Rat gizzards. They smell bad and taste worse, but that's the best the desert has to offer.
Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
My father had this friend... He was an inventor...
I thought you'd never ask.
I dunno.
It's me... Elizabeth.
Oh that's right -- they squished him... Heck of a guy.
Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers --
Get on to yourself!
You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved workin' for you. You had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd snuff a babe. You were the King...
What about Captain Amazing?
Really?
Just wanted to... powder my nose.
Remember the cat.
Roy.
That was easy. 
Yeah.
Monica, where are you?
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
Then at least I will have died trying, right?
So when are we gonna have an on night?
I say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!
Not a chance!
There's a vague similarity.
So why don't you just tell her!
Why not?
Because I can't! Okay? She wouldn't understand!
Then maybe it's time for us to form our own brotherhood... a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of the night!
Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!
Ow.
How long do you have to chase a dream before you realize it's not gonna happen?
Who are they?
The Disco Boys.
He's a legendary masked Mexican crime fighting superwrestler and master of the machete.
Yeah, but how do we get to them?
My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live.  Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live.  He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to.
If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
General Kutusov, feel free to say whatever you like.
I have heard that story but I do not believe it.
Rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything -- however, it doesn't affect what we are talking about.  Please go on.
Yes, General Kutusov, I daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length.  Napoleon would simply spend the winter in Moscow and continue the campaign in the spring.  Another lesser possibility might be to march on St. Petersburg now, although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this, until he refits his army.
And, what a delightful idea!
May I come to the map?
We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense.
Where are they?
It is on this road, sire, following me.
And who is defending Paris?
Yes, sir, I had the honor of meeting them on the trip from Paris.
Yes, sir, I am.
No, sir, none at all.
Thank you, sir.
His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
Why didn't you wake me then?
My God -- this could be very bad for us... very bad, indeed.
But, my dear Duroc, how can I act without guidance from Vienna?  I haven't the slightest idea of how the Emperor Francis might feel about this.
May I suggest that we can prepare and sign the agreement, between ourselves, subject to the approval of the two Emperors.  Believe me, my dear friend, your Archduchess, Marie-Louis, may very well hold, in her hands, the future of our two countries.
I am, Citizen.  Is your mother Madame Josephine de Beauharnais?
This morning, a Lieutenant and three soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons.  I explained we had only my late father's sword, which, in fact, was not a weapon but only a keepsake of memory.
I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month.
Ah, well, that is the first rule of warfare.  You must wear long-sleeved and long-legged underwear.  You can never conjure up brilliancies with a cold bottom.
Then what brings you out on such a night?
Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me.
No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
Lisette.
That's a very nice name.  Where are you from?
Oh, yes... of course.
To Citizen General Bonaparte from one who does not wish to see him dishonored by his wife.  You should know, Citizen General, that your wife has taken a lover, one Captain Hippolyte Charles... undated and unsigned.
You can't be serious.  It would not be good to become another husband out of a Moliere farce.
My mind is made up.  She will not set foot in my house again.  I think if I saw her again, I might be tempted to strangle her.
Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at Paul's house.
Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
Do you expect me to believe that?
No.
Were you in love with any of them?
I cannot promise you that.
I will never forgive you.
I don't understand you.
Open the door.  It's me.
Oh, my darling.  I'm sorry, too.  I won't do that again -- whatever you do.  I won't cause you any more embarrassment, I promise.
Indeed -- well, you may tell Dr. Corvisart, I should be entirely satisfied with half her success.
I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?
That's all you can say?  What are you talking about?
Well, whatever the hell you wanted to do, you are going to tell me everything right now.  Do you understand?!
What was there to tell?
Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views.  I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside.
That is a matter of opinion.
You may save your philosophy for the magistrate, Monsieur Varlac.  I am only a simple officer in the army, and to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called murder by honest men.
Eugene de Beauharnais.
Show him in.
Send him in.
Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
You know me?  I would've shot his big ass.  Hey, Willie, how's it going?  Still steppin' in dog shit every day?
You know what he mean, dude.
If you say another word, it's over.  I'm not playing!
You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
You walked?
I know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters.
It is easy. You know why?  'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look.
You go first.
Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over.
I don't know.  Probably next Friday.
It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys.
Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.
Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.
Sir, the manager stepped out for a moment.  I'm currently running the store. Can I see the CD?
Well, you gonna have to go postal then.
I feel you.  I've just been practicing that one move all week.  I thought that was it.
Yeah, it was.  How you get up here?
Okay, later, bro.  Hey, Craig, nice smokin' wit'cha.
Alright, no problem.  We gone.
I don't believe this sugar shit. Something ain't right.
I don't know, Debo.
I can't feel my legs no more.
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
The skills are still intact.  Now tie his ass up, Elroy.
I slip my disc, again... Oh got damn.
Elroy.
Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
Aw, no lovin' tonight?
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
'S okay. What do you think?
What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
You were very nervous.
It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.
No, that's... That's OK. We don't need any help. We'll be just fine. Won't we, Lynn?
You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
Good.
That's right. He's dead. Tell me why.
How should I...?
I kill her - and you kill me.
Let me talk to her again.
You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me.
Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
Yes. Yes, I can hear you.
Over and out.
He's doing it for you. No matter what anybody tells you, no matter who they are, he's doing it for you, because he loves you.
I promise.
No...kisses to you.
I remember. The big tipper.
This gorilla's watching you, is that right?
There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her.
The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
Yeah, all right, listen...
This is about power and you haven't got any. There's nothing more you can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying.
It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.
You're going to deny me a lousy dollar after I've sweated like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windsheild?
You're a big girl, huh?
It doesn't look like it.
You' oughta learn to relax. I told you I've got it under control.
He was a cool one, that Harper. Never broke.
If you was to let that money serve the Lord's purposes, He might feel kindly turned towards you.
Not even her?
I will guard Pearl with my life...
Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.
Ain't nobody goin' to neither, long as Uncle Birdie's around.
She went.
Bluebeard!
Come on!
Icey, I don't want a husband.
The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
There's something else.
She lieth in wait as for a prey. And increaseth the transgressors among men.
Mister Powell!
Thank you, no. Thank you, dear Icey. I'll tend to them. Thank you.
Huh?
What's that you're playing with, boy?
I'll tell.
Why sure, boy, sure.
Under the stone in the floor.
Come to me, boy!
Tst-tst! Then I reckon I'll have to try again! Where's the money hid?
Miz Jenny! Miz Jenny!
Will you buy me a choclit sody?
Our honeymoon.
How's that?
No, Harry! I thought --
I -- no, I --
I'm through, Harry.
The Lord will provide.
Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.
When did I ever?
He never asked me for nothin'.
Who was scary?
Yeah. Something slippery all over here...  Tina?
Not really.
You believe in the Boogey Man?
No.
Hi.
Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
She lived there.
I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know?
Nancy?
S'curity.
I told you.  It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her.
Jungle man fix Jane.
Good. No more nightmares for either of us then.
An omelet.
Ever since you have been back from Paris...
I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
I have nothing to hide.
You should. I'll show you.
You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
Positively not!
I can tell you exactly.
We like you, Leon -- don't we like Leon?
Friends... friends, Buljanoff, Iranoff...
I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
Good morning, Gaston.
Shall I draw your bath, sir?
You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
Have you?
Are they indeed? Thank you.
Yes.
Certainly.
...it is in the air... it may come around the corner as you walk down the street....
If you want to see us you must come later.
Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman, I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible.
I just said let's have a little lunch.  Room service.
Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow.
I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
Just three people in a room this size? Whew!
Monsieur.
That's even better.
But, gentlemen, I am afraid...
All right, then make an appointment with her so I can see her!
Well, we're back home.
Even the swallows are back.
We will get that... we'll get everything... maybe a little bit later but we'll get it... We must be patient... Finally we got the spring, didn't we? We got the swallows, and you will get your apfel strudel too.
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
Au revoir.
Don't hold that against me... please!
On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.
So it's love which drags you to Moscow.
How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
Thank you.
You might hold this for me.
Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we?
Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
Do not misunderstand me. I do not hold your frivolity against you.  As basic material you might not be bad, but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. I feel sorry for you.
You must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles... It glitters!
Please don't misunderstand me...
Then you don't want me to go there.
The day will come when you will be free. Go to bed, little father. We want to be alone.
I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it. It confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, Ninotchka.
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
You repeat yourself.
I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois.
I was wounded before Warsaw.
You analyze everything out of existence. You analyze me out of existence. I won't let you. Love is not so simple. Ninotchka, Ninotchka, why do doves bill and coo? Why do snails, coldest of all creatures, circle interminably around each other? Why do moths fly hundreds of miles to find their mates? Why do flowers open their petals? Oh, Ninotchka, Ninotchka, surely you feel some slight symptom of the divine passion... a general warmth in the palms of your hands... a strange heaviness in your limbs... a burning of the lips that is not thirst but a thousand times more tantalizing, more exalting, than thirst?
Oh, my barbaric Ninotchka. My impossible, unromantic, statistical...
Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
I didn't follow you.
Must one always be after something?
What?
No.
It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!
I don't think so.
Foolish? If this dress were to walk down the boulevard all by itself I would follow it from one end of Paris to the other, and when I caught up with it I would say, "Just a moment, you charming little dress, I want you to meet Ninotchka... you two were meant for each other." Ninotchka feels more comfortable.
I've never been here before. I wonder whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. Today... now this might shock you... I went up to a taxi and said "Eight Rue du Bois"... and here I am.
Leon, you know the jokes you told me a few days ago? I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them. Now, Leon that's wrong. I know they're not funny, they're silly. They're stupid. And still... I laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they are scoundrels and I should hate them -- then I realize who made them like that, and instead of sending my report to Moscow I tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat... and if this keeps on... am I too talkative?
No speech.
Our salute will be a kiss.
All right.
It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
Well, it has to warm up... you have to give it a chance... just like people... like you and me... first you wanted to fight me and now we belong to the same party... salute!
Well, when it is a choice between my personal interest and the good of my country, how can I waver? No one shall say Ninotchka was a bad Russian.
Good morning, Swana.
You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
Rakonin, bless him, has given me the most amazing news!
It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!
Not in your condition.  Make it tepid, Gaston... tepid and tender. And lay out his gray suit.  Afterwards I'll drive you through the Bois. Slowly... in Waltz time.
Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you?
Yes, Swana, you did.
Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
Hello.
That does it, Swana.  Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.
It is tomorrow morning... tomorrow noon, to be exact. I hope you will forgive me. I know it's extremely cruel to waken anyone at such an hour. Don't you recognize me? I am the Duchess Swana.
Go on.
What do you want?
You mean you have finished the whole investigation?
Yes.
May I ask what has happened?
As soon as our representatives go to a foreign country they seem to lose all sense of balance. If I told you what's going on in Constantinople right now you wouldn't believe it. Those three have been sitting there for six weeks and haven't sold a piece of fur.  This anonymous report was sent me. They are dragging the good name of our country through every caf and night club. Here...  "How can the Bolshevik cause gain respect among the Moslems if your three representatives, Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski, get so drunk that they throw a carpet out of their hotel window and complain to the management that it didn't fly?"
You want me to go to Constantinople?
Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by.
I will do my best.
This will do. 
But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?
Where do you eat?
So ... let's go ...
We'll see about that ...
John, you don't want to start down that road.  I remember what Whittaker Chambers told me back in '48 -- and he was a man who suffered greatly -- he said, "On the road of the informer, it's always night."  This is beyond you or even me.  It's the country, John.  It's the presidency.
Yeah?
Jesus!  Did Mitchell know?
No!  Magruder!  That sonofabitch tests my Quaker patience to the breaking point.
In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to me.
And?
Well, no place where they speak English.  That way he can always say he was misquoted.
Looks like he talked to Joe Kraft ... and to the Times.  Told them he was dead set against the bombing, that you were ... "unstable."  Claims he has to handle you "with kid gloves" ...
Forget it.  Ehrenberg's paid three times that much ...
A dozen?  I got half of 'em elected. I still got the South and Goldwater and his boys.  I'll take my chances with the Senate.
He's completely lost touch with reality.
It's gone.  No one will ever find out what's on it.
Sir?
Apparently he was using some campaign cash that was laundered for us through Mexico.  The FBI's onto it.  We could have a problem with that.
We were working on China.
Play it tough.  That's the way they play it and that's the way we're going to play it.  Don't lie to Helms and say there's no involvement, but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors, bizarre, without getting into it.  Say the President believes it's going to open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again.  Tell Helms he should call the FBI, call Pat Gray, and say that we wish for the sake of the country -- don't go any further into this hanky-panky, period!
I'll talk to Helms.  Oh, Pat asked if you're coming to the Residence for dinner tonight.
I, unlike Senator Kennedy, have a plan to end the war.  But not for peace at any price, but peace with honor!
Before?!  Eisenhower approved that?
Because ... because Dick Helms knows too much ... If anyone in this country knows more than I do, it's Hoover and Helms!  You don't fuck with Dick Helms!  Period.
No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
Run 'em over.
It's the parents' fault really.
What?
... "The Beast."  A nineteen-year-old kid.  She understands the nature of "the Beast."  She called it a wild animal.
I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?
Is it my turn?
I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
Mr. Castro.
I don't think we can treat this as a formality.  Mr. Kennedy made a verbal promise to the Russians not to invade Cuba.  But you authorized Dr. Kissinger to put this in writing.
Flowers are continual reminders of our mortality.  Do you appreciate flowers?
Would you walk with me down to the paddock?  I'd like to look at the horses for the eighth.
If things remain as they are ... He's got the anti-war vote.
I'm trying to spare you an embarrassment.  Johnny Roselli is on his way back here.
I never met the man.
It could be '60 all over again, Edgar. Bobby's got the magic, like a goddamn rock star.  They climb all over each other just to touch his clothes! He'll ride his brother's corpse right into the White House.
I know ...
Remember what Lenin said in 1917, Mr. President: "The power was lying in the streets just waiting for someone to pick it up."  The Communists have never been closer.  Now is the time to go back to the old themes, the ones that made you president.  Let the Communists know you're onto them.
It won't.  As long as I'm here.
We're gonna be plumbers, Frank.  We're gonna plug a leak.
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
Exactly, yes, Mr. President.  That is my contention.
Don't be too proud; never be too proud to go on your knees before God.
Yes, Mr. President.
Did you cry when he died?
I don't know.  He made me see the stars ...
Free, if you're the president.
... but it's not, bottom-line, gonna change a goddamn thing, John.  The question is: How do we screw Ellsberg so bad it puts the fear of God into all leakers?
... Use his women.
Syracuse.
Ernie Davis.
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
Yes, I understand that.
I know.  I know.  I've seen a lot of kids die, too, in World War II.
What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
You know how much money he had in the bank when he died?  Nothing.  He was so damned honest ...  But I miss him.  I miss him a hell of a lot.
Buddy, look at me ... just look at me. Do you really want me to quit?
You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they?  New Hampshire ...
I asked him, "Lyndon, what would you do, on a scale of one to ten?"  And he said, "Bomb the shit out of Hanoi, boy!  Bomb them where they live." ... John, do you think I was too soft on TV?
Yeah, sure, a long time ago.
They're all your enemies?
When?
Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it.  I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court.
Lost.
Let's wait and see how you survive your first crisis, Rocky ...
Who else'd be in your truck.
She just told me you was quittin'. Sit down.
No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.
Not hardly nothin' in her room. And that establishment was no stickler on registration. Well...
Well what would you call him.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
Some pretty bad people.
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
Uh-huh.
You sure?
I don't know...
I don't know. Oh.
Sheriff?
I'm goin' to try and keep from it as much as I can.
Yes Sheriff.
Well they always is to the party concerned.
Well I put it in. That one. You just set there. I'll get tickets and a cart for the bags.
I wouldn't worry about it.
It's full a money.
Big talk.
What're you doin', baby?
Why would we go to Odessa?
Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days.
Uh-huh.
I shall return.
What should I do?
She'll be all right.
It will be brought to me and placed at my feet.
You expect him?
Not a bleep.
You from around here?
Why would I care where you're going.
So what're you goin' up there for.
No. Do you?
Now is not a time. What time do you close.
Sir?
You already have the tent?
The kind with the most poles.
November the 28th, last year.
Can I get my parking ticket validated?
I'm just one person. Don't matter the size of the bed.
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
Another additional.
No, one forty-two.
Half.
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
It's called a transponder.
Nam?
It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being. I also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight.  Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?
...I meant your food.
Oww! My arm, careful!
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
It wasn't a woman.
Bad idea...
You better handle what's in this garbage can first.
Anyway, so what?
A woman can write a check.
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
Ah, shit... Do I have to hear this now?
Tell him what you told me.
You watch your mouth when you're in a goddamn county vehicle... You don't think I see what's going on? Del, now this Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some episode off the X-Files... 's just a crime of passion, plain and simple. Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that's what is going on here.
Uh-huh.  Anyway, I'm thinking Easter, 'cause I just fucking love pastels.
This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
No, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
Damn, life is strange. I had you figured for this cold-blooded, calculating bitch -- Not that I didn't admire you for it.
Wait. Let me get this out.  I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
...what're you saying?
I don't think I am.
Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.
Really? You've just described all of Southern California.
No... what about your sister?
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
Sue Ann, I thought you of all people would back me up on this, you know what Del's like. How did he take my note?
I gotta go.
No, Del.
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
You're late, Eric.
I just want everything to be perfect between us.
I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
Stop calling me David. We're on set, for Christ's sake, you don't have to call me David here.
What do you mean? What did I do to you...
Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?
...What? What did you call me? George... McCord. You're my favorite actor on...
You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
All right, then. Actually, I'm glad you're going out. I got something going on tonight. Some serious clients, with real potential.
Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
I came for love...
I don't know.
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
Make sure it's elevated...
I woulda' been here sooner, but Ballard put me in jail. He still thinks you had Del scalped.
It's not really a good time, guys...
He's a prick. Merle?... You're a prick.
That's horrible!
Really?
I'll go to the Hospital.
To tell you the truth, I can't believe I've made it this far. It may not be Europe, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell.'
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy...
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
You never know who you'll see.
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
Where are you going?
I have to leave now.
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
No, you're not. You're a good doctor, Lonnie, but you're not David Ravell. I've made my decision. Now, if you'll excuse me...
Good.
You know, it's interesting. The South lost the Civil War, but they still seem to get all the glory.
I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
That is so right.
So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?
I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.
Betty would never dress like that. She's not some trailer park slut!
...She's got class, and poise. Lots of poise...
There it is again. That lousy attitude that got us here in the first place. That "make a statement," do an end zone dance, shake your ass and sue everybody in sight attitude that's dragging this whole country down the drain.  They don't owe us shit, Wesley! WHEN YOU FINISH THE JOB, YOU GET PAID!! WE HAVEN'T FINISHED THE GODDAMN JOB!!
What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
What doesn't?
"It's beneath her..." She's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!
I said 'got it?'
You better believe it.
No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
Because it ain't natural, young man.
Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
It's Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore's friend? I heard from her.
Do not seek the treasure!
Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas; must be my Hogwallop blood.
Gopher, Everett?
What'd the devil give you for your soul, Tommy?
Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar - it's just -
Campaign manager? Waldrip.
Wipin' little circles with his bread.
Ain't gonna paddle it; he's gonna kick it real hard.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.
No weddin'.
And you were right about that ring. Any other weddin' band would not do. But this-here was foreordained, honey; fate was a-smilin' on me, and ya have to have confidence -
That wasn't my doing...
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can.
Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely recollect, uh -
Buyin' nipples!
Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.
I don't know. That's just how it sounded. Well, I'll see you.
Yeah, I know.
That's a lie, Mayo. You've gone through a lot worse, haven't you?
No way, Mayo. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. Think they'd trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? Hey, man, I figure you for the kind of guy who'd zip off one day in my F-14 and sell it to the Cubans.
Well, goodbye.
Before that.
I didn't call you anything before that.
Lauder, Sweet Pea!
Only two things come out of Oklahoma, steers and queers. Which one are you, boy? I don't see any horns so you must be a queer.
Then you're dumber than I thought! All you'll get from their kind is pregnant!
Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can.
One more minute.
No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
What do you mean?
No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
No. I never feel like that.
That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period.  I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.
My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.
Yeah? Why're you here?
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
Opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know.
Forget it. Just get out of here.
I'm starving.
I've seen all that a hundred times.
Zack, I don't know if I want to do that...
That's okay. I'm used to it.
Sure.  Zack, I hope you know I didn't have to show you that picture.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
Foley's not poor. Buddy of mine in oh-four told me he's the son of a rich doctor down in Louisiana.
That's what they want you to think, but I saw where she lived, what is she's trying to get away from.  Just take my word for it, pard. Break it off now. Do it this week.
No problem, but who's Susan?
Doesn't mean shit. Get her to a doctor. You can't do anything until you hear what he says. Make the appointment yourself.
I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
Jesus Christ, Sid! Is everything your responsibility?
God.
There is not one thing funny here.
Yes.
Hey man, it's the neighbor's house, who breaks in through the neighbor's house?!
I know.
That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
Fourteen business days.  Escrow is always business days.
Daddy's not coming back, she's in the middle of a divorce, it's just the two of them.  We're okay, here.  We can do this, right?
Okay, fuckball, you think.  What are we gonna do?
She lied.  Cops woulda been here by now if she called 'em.  Besides, Junior cut the phones.
Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in the room.
We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
Shit!
Huh?
What do you want?
Oh, that phone call...
Shoulda got an apartment.
The crowd goes wild.
Feel okay?
Get the fuck out of my house!
I don't know, why?
On the floor!  Get on the floor!
Yes, no, I don't know, do 'em all!
Huh uh.
Are you fucking with me? You smartass piece of shit...
What's with you?
Yeah... I'm fucked up. You're fucked up. Government's fucked up. Whole country's fucked up. You got no idea what's going on here. This is bigger than you and me. We're just little tiny soldiers getting moved around on some big asshole's desk. The Panthers... fuck you're history... they killed you and you don't even know it.
No Fuck you!!!
Can you make a deal with them?
And did you witness the shoot-out?
Yes sir, I did.
No sir he didn't.
I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me.
Work harder. And get me some results. Those Black Bastards could be up to anything.
So what's the deal?
Yeah... let me think about it.
Yeah I know. You're smart Judge. You ain't no bourgeois nigger like those Paper Panthers across the bay. I need every good man to help us with the security on Betty Shabazz, particularly soldiers. You do solid on that I might have something else for you, something real important.
But nothing... you do live here don't you?
I don't know.  But I'm sure I'll find out. Rose, you did me solid.
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
His journals, letters, maps, books...
I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
You got me beat on both accounts.
Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
Thank you.
As do you.
You couldn't have known.
I know that.
Colonel will do.
Very well, proceed, sir.
I will do so as soon as possible.
Prisoner exchange.
Poor Richard says they'll make a Declaration of Independence by July.
When I have children, I hope I don't hide behind them.
Yes.
We'd cover more ground if we split up.
Seven homes along the Black River so far...
Is it her?  Is Anne in there?
You know what happened.
And what do they know?
I'm sorry.
We saw.
Four thousand infantry and around six hundred cavalry...  ... including the Green Dragoons under Tarleton.
They're gone.  And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back. But there is something you can do to help end all this.
You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that...
But what about Thomas?
About a hundred and twenty.  Less than a third.
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
It doesn't seem long to me. It seems short. I think the whole thing about pets dying s-s-sucks!
No more chocolate chip cookies.
Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right?
Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't quite that way, deah!
Don't bother. I'm coming home.
Good for you.
What?
Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.
Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
Just don't stop, Louis. You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God.  And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear.
Don't worry about that.
Spirit of the north country. Not a good spirit. Wendigos are great liars and tricksters, according to the stories. And if one touches you...
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
Don't talk like an asshole even if you are just a bit of underdone potato or a blot of mustard.
Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
I just said--
I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
That's fair.
The situation has changed.
My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
Thank you, sir.
Will -- you can't trust him.
That would hardly be proper.
Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
I know the code.
At least once more, Miss Swann. As always.
-- then we never would have met.
I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.
I saved your life; now you've saved mine.  We're square.
No, I'm -- rescuing you.
Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
Last time, I was here a grand total of three days.  Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.  But from the looks of this, they've been out of business, and so that won't be happening again.  We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.
So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
A fool's errand.
Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold.
Ah -- he's learned, then.  Plays things more close to the vest. See, Jack was a cartographer, back in Old England.  Somehow he came by the money to commission the Pearl. Hired himself a crew, promised each man an equal share.  So, they're forty days out, and the First Mate says, everything's an equal share, that should mean the location of the island, too.  So Jack gave up the bearings.  That night, there was a mutiny.
Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.
Sorry, I didn't know.
Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
Indeed.
By remembering that I serve others, not only myself.
Funny, I was thinking along those lines.  How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.
I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
Move!
Somewhat.
Where does it make berth?
We need to go!
I'd die for her.
So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start.  My advice -- smile and enjoy it.
It's not true my father was a pirate.
On what?
On whether the stories are all true.  If they are, that's a waterfall that spills over at high tide, with a short drop to an underground lagoon.  If not --
Don't talk.  These caves magnify sound.  Just follow me.
You've seen the Black Pearl?
You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
And no lies!
Bleak.  Very bleak.
If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.
That's right.  And making me was the biggest mistake you ever made!
She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.
You're right.  Place a call to our friends at the network and to Mr. Joplin at the E.P.A.
Poppy, please, just tell me what you want.
Not that.
Dr. Nebbleman, take care of them.
I like Trix!
Haw-haw!  Why don't you run off and find a cop and I'll wait right here.
What I've always done.  As long as I'm the only one who can build the nanobot, I'm the only one who can say when it should be tested.
Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said, Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you?
What?  No kiss?  Not even for old times sake?
I remember you said, nanotechnology was going to change the world.
God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange.
I can't help it, Suze.  It's this place.  You know how I get in these stores.  They freak me out.  All these tiny boxes, little cans filled with eight syllable God knows what.
Mouse?  What mouse?
Once the subject was polymerized we were unable to reassemble the original organic structure.
Why?
You have no one to blame but yourself.
Oh yeah?
We lost him.
Pipe down, brain lady!  And you...
You're all right.
I'm not interested. Smythe will open the door.
So, it's obvious, huh?
How-di-do.
None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they concern me.
I don't need any new ties. I've got another tie - I've got another one besides this one. And it's a pip, too. There's only one thing wrong with it. You know what that is?  It has a little weakness for gravy, and once in a while it leans a little toward ketchup. Of course that's only in its weaker moments. When you move down to my place, I'll show it to you.
Of course I am Stewart.
I know that.
Oh, no I won't my dear - oh, no I won't my dear - I'll wash behind my ears, but no I won't my dear!
Why, down at the office, we always look at Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher, that's all.
That's ridiculous.
I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith.
I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat.
Is that so?
As one Tribune man to another
Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
Yeah?
Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.
I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
Gloria Golden?
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
Right - for the first time this year.
Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
Not on my own beat, no.
'For he's only a bird in a gilded cage, a beautiful sight to see'  Tweet, tweet - ha, ha
Oh, but you didn't engage me, sir.
There you are. You caught on. You see, you're nice and you're smart too. You caught on right away. Outside! Go on! Outside! And don't come back!
I bet.
Oh, you don't appreciate it. Her pictures don't do her justice. Why, Gallagher, she's queenly - she is queenly - and I know queens!  And oh, has she got herself a nose - and I know noses too. That little snozzle of hers is the berries, I tell you. And is she cute when she throws that little snozzle to the high heavens!
And the rest of us are truck horses?
I hope you'll be very happy.
Who me? She wouldn't want to meet me. I'm just an old load of hay.
Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name.
Cut that out. Just because I'm married - there's no reason for that.
Her family? Oh, they'll be all right. I'll bring them around.  Gilded cage?!  Besides, I'm not marrying her family. Stew Smith in a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha!  That mug. What does he know?
Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before.  It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
Never even been to New Madrid.
I don't know a thing about him, but isn't he the one you're always yelling about?
Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
Nope - afraid I'm all out of tricks tonight.
Don't be sorry. Just get the breakfast, that's all.
Well, from now on the play will be easy. All you have to do is bring the wife back, have her say she's sorry, and then your play's over.
Go?! Wait a minute - that's a great story! Newspaper reporter was forcibly ejected from Schuyler Mansion, and
Thanks. May I sit down?
She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.
Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
That's putting it crudely, but
Heavens! The man's insane!
That's what I think of it, Bingy!
Found no skeletons?
No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
Well, if I couldn't be a good putterer, I wouldn't want to putter. But why? What makes you think I couldn't be a good putterer?
Yeah?
... Sex.
Yes.
What?
We're in Pleasantville?
She's crying.
I've got to go ...
Um ... It's ...
Oh you bet.  Will you excuse me for a sec?
It's six-thirty ...
What's the matter?
She won't go out with me?
No. Of course not.
The basketball team?
Oh sure it is.
You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.
We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back.
It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank?
I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set.  You like all this don't you?
Yeah ...
This thing works. We could go home right now.
Honestly ... no.
Yeah.
Well it's big. And it's blue ...  ... It's really really blue.
Marmalade.
Ooomph?
Because we don't belong!
Well c'mere, young fella.
You're not going anywhere. You're gonna get that remote and you're gonna come home and we're gonna make everybody HAPPY AGAIN!!!
Just gimme the damn remote!
I'm going on trial tomorrow?
Yes.
What's the rush?
Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the least I could do.
Well, you don't have to worry about that anymore.
Hey.
So you can't talk to me?
Well, I can't talk though --
No, no, no.
I don't know...I mean: I don't know.
Yeah, but please don't do that.
It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
Please don't.
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
No.
Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?
....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
Yes.
Sure.
It doesn't matter.
Well why don't you take your pants off and stroke it for me?
I'm fine. Who is this?
Hi....what....what's up....?
Can I ask you a question?
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.
Yes I can't....I don't make enough money to be able to do that.
....what....?
Should I just ask your girlfriend?  Maybe I should call back and talk to your girlfriend?
I know I did. But I don't.
....this is your mistake....
I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
Do you know them.
It's terrible, no.
It's ok. That's ok. How long have you worked with Elizabeth?
Sure.
Sure.
Yeah.
....yeah....
What happened?
Did you take it from the street in front of your work?
Yeah.
If you come to Hawaii --
Yeah.
I'll see you later.
Ok.
Thank you.
Lena?
When was the last time you had a girlfriend?
This is nice.
I don't have any business here. I came here for you, I didn't have any business.
Yeah.
Can I come home with you when we get there?
What is this?
Let's go to the hospital.
If they break or something. What is it, plastic?
Did you have my home phone number?
No.
Well who did?
I didn't do that.
Your hand is bleeding.
Alright, well you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to go.
Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
What do you mean?
Barry Egan.
Of course, it's just for us to verify your credit card information. It's completely confidential and it appears on your credit card billing statement as D&D Mattress Man.
337-09-9876. But I don't want anyone to know my name.
That's fine. Can I have a telephone number, area code first on where we can call you back?
Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service --
I haven't even told you what's happened. Your girl that you have that works there for you threatened me and two men just chased me -- extorted money -- DEAN Go fuck yourself that shit doesn't have anything to do with me - this is a legitimate bossiness.
....I have seven.
Business is very food, thanks. ELIZABETH What's very food?
Well I'm sorry. Before...
I wanted to ask you because you're a doctor, right?
I know that. Maybe you know other doctors?
Alright: And I have to go and buy some more pudding for this trip to Hawaii and as I just said that out loud I'm realizing it sounds a little strange but it's not. So can you come and help me out?
You gotta give me some money.
No, no, no, no c'mon man, don't make it a thing --
Yes I am.
Seriously.
Ok.
When can you leave?
No, no. This is bad, something might have happened, we should just --
Yeah.
Will you call me later to talk about asking Walter for the shrink? And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something?
It's fine.
I'm sorry. You're right.
I think he's weird, but that's me.
They've the satisfaction only a hard day's labor can provide.
I think she's sweet on him, that's what I think.
Don't say that; reading's my salvation.
Is that a promise you can truly keep?
Mother's not half so blind as you.
Why not?
You'll hate me now, won't you?
I'll fill page after page, I promise.
And --?
There I was taxed; it's true.
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
Don't be absurd; it's only a play.
You can't --! You mustn't --! I've all the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on paper --
"Part the gates of heaven," as it were --
His rug.
AND DID YOU?
Why was it you never took her by force?
We inspected the body, Marquis. She died a virgin.
Of course.
I hope you'll judge him by his progress here, and not his past reputation.
Charenton is my life's work. To have her wrested from beneath me now --
This child let loose the beast from its cage --
I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
Was ever a man more risqu? He wants to take me every way!
"Well worth the dig!"
Go ahead; you've a key. Slip it through my tiny hole...
It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake.
What's that then?
I don't believe it!
How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
You could whisper it through the walls of your cell.
You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
No. But tell him I would.
That ill-gotten funds, borne of his degeneracy, might now effect his salvation.
Give me back my anonymity, that's all I ask! Let me be invisible again!
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
She knew what she was signing on for After all, she took the money.
Mr. Welles certainly is a caution
Mm.
I can't
Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
Marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
To make pictures.
I'll remember that.
You know that can't happen.
Oh, why is that?
There certainly is I There certainly is! Aw, to hell with you!
There is nothing to discuss-
You are slovenly and unattractive and I won't  t-t-t-tolerate it.
I just want to understand--
And how do you feel when you are lied to?
Then make them up! You're drunk and you're angry.
We're not all hopped up on benzedrine, Orson I Some of us humans need sleep!
Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink, would you like--?
And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.
Can I talk to Hearst?
Showing life
Then you better get ready to be the youngest never- was in Hollywood history.
You're a laugh-riot, kid.
But with compassion and insight--
I'm not fucking with Hughes. That shit-kicker would kill us dead, baby. Just like Jean Harlow
No, it's perfect! When in doubt, put on a cape! False noses and faux beards and flowing capes have been the life-blood of the actor's craft since the days of lrving and Booth.  Imagine me in a glittering suit of lights on the dusky Andalusian plains--
Jesus
This better be good
Please don't say this.
Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
She was . . . innocent
It is 350 pages of ... ABSOLUTE INSPIRATION!
Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.
I don't care.
What does this have to do with--?
Face it, Orson, they're gonna hate it. I told you, not enough closeups and too many scenes with a bunch of New York actors.
And they went to the stockholders in New York.
I, um, need an estimate on some jewelry I might wish to sell. But d-d-discretion is very important to me b-b-because I don't want anyone t-t-to, um, know that--
Not one of them today has what you had, Miss Davies. Not one of them.
You're going to destroy it
It was the best, kid
Without me. I'm afraid. I got the axe this morning.
Five...? Yes. No. We're done today
Ok, champ.
What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?
Believe what you want.
No, I can't wait. You know when I wait? When it's important to wait. It's not important to wait for no steak. It's important to wait for Reeves to leave the ring. It ain't important to wait for no steak! I won that fight. So, I stayed in the ring, and that way I made sure everybody knew it. I shoulda knocked him out earlier, sonofabitch.
You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
Sure. What is it?
See that, I don't feel it. I can take it. I know I can take anybody.
Don't ever bring those kids up here again! I'm working out, I'm killin' myself in here, and they walk around like they fuckin' own the neighborhood.
You know, like bang her or anything?
Didn't you just see her lookin' at him? She told me no, but I don't believe her.
I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...
C'mon, Joey.
Except fall down like a normal person.
Yeah, except fall down. That's right.
What?
When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
But you said "you."
You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?
Maybe it wasn't you, but you know what I'm talkin' about.
What do you think of Jake's retirement, Mrs. LaMotta?
I just wanted to say hello.
I was just...
Don't tell me "No." I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him?
What?
I never noticed his face.
Tryin' to get this fuckin' TV to work. Paid all this money for it and still can't get a station a mile away. And Mr. Wizard here ain't no help.
Yeah --
No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.
I'd tell you to bet a bundle.
Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.
Get lost.  Hey kids, "A cop is a rat." Remember that, "A rat."
Hey Joey, I'm here with Patsy and Vera and Sandy. And Vickie just happened to come along. We're just trying to have a good time. What do you want from me? So, why don't you just take it easy before this gets out of hand.
Well, officer -- do your duty.
For instance?
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
Jeff -- huh?
Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.
I can't do it even if he's gone.
Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear.
What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
Yeah -- frequently -- it ran something like this: "Your request for transfer turned down --"
Everything he owns is laid out on the bedroom, ready for packing.
He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
And how many people did you cut up with the couple of with it? Or hundred knives you've probably owned in your lifetime?
Tom, I've got something real big for you.
Your Lisa?
I know what you told me! She went in to get evidence, and she came out with it.
You think perhaps it was "old hambone?"
Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.
Wrong week. Next Wednesday I emerge from this plaster cocoon.
Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour?
Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take pictures from a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary.
Something wrong?
Who are you?
For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
That's a start. I'm at the Brevoort now. I'll be looking for you.
How?
You've got a hormone deficiency.
You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood.
That's normal.
She's all right.
How did you know!
I was.
Get back there! He'll see you!
Oh. Well, yes and no. It wasn't an official call. He's just a friend.  An old, ornery friend.
I'll watch the alleyway -- in case it goes that way.
Now wait a minute --
That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
Hasn't been any big demand for tickets.
Well, I'm going to make this a week you'll never forget.
I wish there was one I wanted.
You mean leave the magazine?
Yes.
I think it's enchanting.
Three.
Well, they'd be very stylish in Finland -- just before you froze to death. Begin to get the idea?
There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa. You have the town in the palm of your hand.
Lisa -- there's something terribly wrong.
You'd better before you catch the disease!
Not yet!
Women aren't that unpredictable.
Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
Inside stuff?
Lisa, I won't be able to give you any --
It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
Who was the trunk addressed to?
In the whole courtyard, only one person didn't come to the window. 
And the last thing she'd leave behind would be her wedding ring!  Do you ever leave yours at home?
Chelsea 2-7099.  We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again.  I'm using that word "we" a little too freely, I guess. I don't take any of the chances.
Shall we vote him in, Stella?
Lisa -- I -- I -- can't tell you how scared I was that you -- you might --
Know the Millertown bluff?
How'd he get in?
Will you wait a minute?
He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink.
No--thanks, very much, Mr. Stark.
Let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand?  The kid has no friends yet and--
Why don't you come back tomorrow, son?  Ever been booked before?
Hi there.
I'm sorry--I made a mistake.
Plato.  It's a nickname.
I just don't want trouble.
No.  It's perpetual motion.
Oh, I bet some little guy comes in here at night and pushes it.  Go- go-go!
No.  In the morning.
O.K.  G'night.  I got to pick up my scooter.  See you tomorrow.
How'd you find me?  What's happening?
Come out come out wherever you are!
I'm what?  What?
Why?
Well, stop hiding and stand up.  I can't talk to you if I don't see you.
You sure?
I need it.
Just a guard.
Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back?
Goodbye, dear.
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
What's that got to do with it?
Do I have to spell it out?
No.
She eats him alive and he takes it.
Pretty mixed up?
You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place.
Okay--
Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
Yes, ma'am.
Dig the square wardrobe!
A what?
I'm not so bad.
I'm numb.
Where can we go?  I can't go back into that zoo.
I'm never going back.
Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
What?
Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere.
Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more.  People he really likes--he lets call him "Jamie."
Oh, we can manage that!  I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
He hates me.
What?
You said you'd call my father.
But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
No.  Why?
I'd like to, that's all.  Girls your age don't do that.  You need an explanation?
Must have a way with stationery.
What are you doing here?!
Don't hurt him...
We're talking, aren't we?
One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
I don't think it's negative five.
What.
Smile.
Not bad. Just regular.  You wrote me wonderful things, Nick. Personal things.
Yes it was all you --
Then he shoulda signed his name.
No boyfriend of mine is going to walk around in negative-five degree wind chill without a goddamn good- looking coat!
He's not a bad person, Nick... he's not...
What the fuck is going on.
When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?!
I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
Not without you.
Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.
Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
Keep 'em there for a little while.
He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you.
But I never said Rudy.
Yes!
She says a lot of things.
I don't know.
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
We got faith in you, Nick Mason.  You're our inside man.
I did.
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum
You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need six.  Six is me.
No way.
No, you're not.
Where is he?! Where is he?!
He's not Nick Mason...
We're aware of your position.
What?
Cancer-sucker.
His lips went next. You ever see some silicon-fucking-lips?
Hell you haven't.
What?
Get a hot mug of chocolate.  First thing I'm gonna do.
Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.
Tell Ashley... I...
Always wanted to rob that casino, Rudy. Way back when I worked there. What better way than to get some guys to rob it for me.
How'd you know I'd do it.
Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
What? No...
There is no other table --
THEY'LL OPEN ONE!
Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew.
No shit, he's gonna fuckin' die on us if we don't get him taken care of.
How do you know all this?
The cops were there waitin' for us!
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.
Cause you're a faggot, alright?
You gonna put it away?
No, they're not.
Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake. He's a good kid. I understand you're hot, you're super-fuckin' pissed. We're all real emotional. But you're barking up the wrong tree. I know this man, and he wouldn't do that.
He don't believe in it?  You don't believe in it?
Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
You don't have any idea what you're talking about. These people bust their ass. This is a hard job.
You even doubt it? I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up! I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm. But those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.  You haven't thought about this?
Why not?
What's wrong with it?
As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw the cops.
No real people?
You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a -
No shit?
Look, asshole, I'm right! Somebody's a fuckin' rat. How many times do I hafta say it before it sinks in your skull?
Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.
He ain't dead.
So what is it?
We can't take him to a hospital.
Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up.
I don't know anybody.
What are you gonna do about him?
This is what he was doin'.
There's a slight difference.
Graham's got something to tell you might interest you.
Maybe he did.
Like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.
And one of 'em is sick.
Just about.
And look at it this way. How about Jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough spot.
Would you, Mr. Phillips?
His letters will keep.
We can't stay here!
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
The who?
You should know. She's in your dream.
Yes. But -- that was the other night. Now -- I don't think I would.
Hurry up.
Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
No they won't.
No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me.  How's she feel?
Nice.
That's right, Steve.
Oh... that's the time you went away.
Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder.  Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.
Kind of feeling your oats this morning. I haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old.
Yeah -- but don't make a habit of it.
The whole state's lookin' for 'em.  And they're lookin' for me.
All right, you didn't know.
Don't ask me because I won't tell you! I won't tell anybody! Go away!
I like it.
Well, say it.
There aren't any women here.
Depends on how good you drive.
Now where's she goin'? --
Please. Maybe he'll take a good look at you and stop thinking so much about his horses.
That's it then.
He can wait. Let's stay here until morning.
But he just never troubled to have you get any schooling?
I sure would.
Why not? You went farther than that last time.
How about California?
That's always tough. How long were you together?
Do I know you?
So, I guess I can go now.
Yeah, me too.
Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around.
No. I never date outside my race.
I meant you're into ghosts.
Then what kinda stuff can we do?
Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
Her hair doesn't have as many split ends at yours. Her skin isn't as oily as yours, either. Also, sometimes your eyes get kinda squinty and they look like you might have Down's Syndrome or something. Otherwise the resemblance is uncanny.
Let's get outta here.
Come on. There's a first aid kit in the lab.
There's something I want to share with you too. Here, smell this.
Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend.
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Oh.
Then what are we going to do?
That's what your man is supposed to do.
Hot dogs.
Thanks, I'll be fine.
But he'll kill her!
Right behind you.
Yeah, I broke my fall.
I'm Hanson the caretaker.
Alright, let's take a vote...
Soon, but first I must bless this house.
Nah, I need a place to stay. So how do you like being in college?
Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!
Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.
I wouldn't go that far.
Any of them hot?
We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?
Right. What about condoms?
Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw.
Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
That's why we came here, remember?
Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.
And sexy.
That's it. I'm gonna put my food in your ass. I should warn you, I'm a black belt in karate.
Alright, go to the belt store...
Yes... Sometimes you have to give them candy.
Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there.  Did you bring my bag?
Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys.
You said you hated him.
Well... he was an asshole... but he didn't deserve to die!
Always the dentist.
I certainly did not.
Is there a killer loose?
Oh Mom...
I'm so happy I could shit.
You mean for TV or print?
We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.
Ooohhhh!
Yes, I did.
...People who don't mind their own business.
I certainly did.
Who's voice was it, Dottie?
I certainly was not!
One beer with lunch is hardly "drinking".
So you admit you just lied?
What do you mean, you're not sure?!
That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
Just a boy. He's picking me up this morning.
Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!
You got your wish.
If you wouldn't mind...  It was on sale.
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin. I'd recommend therapy for your son.  Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
You forgot something...
Yes, ma'am, it is.
Then you know that if I give you a little advice, it'll be good advice.
You can?
Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee
Look. Don't say a word. I've taken an interest in you and I'm willin' to put up my time to help you. Besides, I think I know where to find your sister.
Where?
Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
Yes. She bought my sister's business.
You can't tell.
It's the last door at the end of this hall.
It doesn't matter. You want to now. You should want to. It's your obligation, your duty.
She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
I know. For the first time I'm beginning to be frightened. I almost feel as if I'd never known my sister.
I guess most people are.
What did she want to know?
But I'd give a great deal to know.
But I reel guilty. It doesn't seem right for me to enjoy myself with Jacqueline gone.
I won't do it again. We're friends. I'll never order you about again.
Oh, I'm making investigations.
You've never believed a word I told you about Mr. August.
There is a very simple way. Got a telephone book?
Gregory   you'd better take Jacqueline with you tonight.
It's what I should have done yesterday. I'll take her away somewhere where she can rest.
Well, that's illuminating.
I suppose so. I can pick him up somewhere.
And then?
I don't know.
I won't get lonely.
Yes.
I went as a detective. I found out that Mrs. Redi reads the same books as Dr. Judd.
Don't make me tell you, Jason.
And you believe that?
I have to. It was Irving August -- everything Mrs. Redi said - it fits in with what I saw - she even knew I'd seen his body on the subway.
Bella Romari	If I were not seated, I would embrace you in three movements like a sonata.  Ah, my wonderful one. Fly with me tonight. We will take your coffee machine and live with the gypsies.
No, not at all, Mr. Jason.
After that wonderful first book - after all the adulation and the good reviews?
Yes. When I tell you.
It might have.
I don't know.
Thank you, my dear.
I have no intention whatsoever of hinting. Your sister, Mary, is a murderess. She killed Irving August -- stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding.
Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
I doubt if you'll get anything out of that woman. But if  you'd like to try, I'll advance you the money to make the trip to New York. Of course, my dear, if you don't find your sister, you can always come back here.
No, Nancy.	You've got to sleep two more minutes.
Why
Because I have something very important to do.
What?
When?
Yes.  Oh, you mean to bring in! No. Yes, I have some other things, no, I don't need to bring them in. This is all I need to stay here.
Oh, uh-huh.
You play an instrument?
Who's Elizabeth?
Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.
Why is that?
I am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person I've ever seen.
They are looking at you. Ann, you are truly breathtaking. I don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. Men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. And those that don't or can't resent you. And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.
You had sex with you therapist?
Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.
You went out with her?
Can we look at one?
Why not?
I know.
It won't. Are you ready?
Ann Bishop Millaney.
When we're making love?
Sometimes. Afterward.
I know. Deep down, I know that. It just bothers me, when I have feelings or impulses that she has.
No.
You said you weren't always impotent.
And now you can?
Don't you get lonely?
Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself.
God, I m so mad at him!!
So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?
I couldn't face her if I had slept with somebody else.
You mean you're still in contact with her?
Not entirely.
Oh, you just moved here to think about it, right?
Because.
"Because"? That's not good enough. I asked you a question, Graham. I asked you "how does it feel"? How does it feel, Mr. I Want To Go Down On You But I Can't? Do you know how many people you've sucked into your weird little world? Including me? Come on, how does it feel?
All right!! All right!! You want to know? You want to know how I feel? I feel ashamed. Is that what you wanted to hear?
Are you going to see Elizabeth while you're here?
Did you see a message to call me when you got back in?
I ate by myself.
There's nothing to know, Ann.
I didn't say it was rational, I just said I was convinced.
Isn't therapy helping at all?
I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.
I want out of this marriage.
Well, do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are? I mean, maybe they do, but I doubt those people are in therapy. Besides, being happy isn't all that great. My figure is always at its best when I'm depressed. The last time I was really happy I put on twenty-five pounds. I thought John was going to have a stroke.
Yeah, I know.
About a week ago. I don't know what brought it on, I just started feeling like I didn't want him to touch me.
But see, he stopped before I got that feeling, that's why it seems weird to me. I mean, I'm sure he wishes I would initiate things once in awhile, and I would except it never occurs to me, I'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that I have felt like starting something I was by myself.
Radon leakage?
What visitor?
Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?
Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
I guess.
You understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time?
Yes.
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
What are you talking about?
Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
No, I didn't.
Because. Cynthia, look, John was right. Graham is strange. Very strange. You don't want to get involved with him.
Why?
That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
About what?
You just want to ask me questions?
I just want to ask you questions.
That's all.
Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.
Different.
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
I'm intrigued.
How about inviting me over to dinner?
You know what I mean.
Cynthia. John.
Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.
I just... Ann is very...
Hung up.
I can't believe I let him stay in my house. Right under my nose. That deviant fucker was right under my nose and I didn't see him.
If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.
I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
You have family here also?
Yes, this afternoon. I was grilling Ann about your marriage this afternoon.
Really. How'd it go?
You know which tapes! Where are they?
Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc...  ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out.
I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic.
Medical clinic?
Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
OK. I'll meet you back there. Don't leave until I get there. Lock the door and don't open it except for me. OK?
It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please.
But you gave up your private practice. Suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist?
You know and I know that Hobbes was a lousy teacher, eh? Lousy. Dry, academic, afraid of women, lousy. But he was always a genius at one thing -- getting grants. Could he get grants for crazy projects?
Lemme clarify for you.
Huh?
OK, Rog. See you at ten.
YOUNG MALE INTERN, TALL AND HANDSOME
Check.  The quacks are willing tools?
Nothing.  Just...memories!
I got it!  I got it!!!
I'm Janet Majors and this is my husband Brad.
He needs help.
I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
Why Janet?
They probably meant Irving and wanted you to swing.
I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
It's happened before.  Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?  He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.
Yes, Betty.
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
TENDERNESS AND INNOCENCE IN DENTON`
Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues?
We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight.  Is this true?
And how does *'local girl'* Janet Majors fit into the scheme of things?
Why?
Your father doesn't like Mexicans.
OUR RAVING SAVIOUR THAT'S YOU!!
YOUNG BLOOD
If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me.
Flavors!
F for...
F for...
Foods!
I can't wait to begin on him. Really, Bert, I don't know what we'd do without you!
Yes, Janet.  Leave the crying to Brad.
And you can 'peep in' on Brad in the morning.
YOU'RE NO GOOD
YOU KEEP GOING BACK IT'S DRIVING YOU INSANE
SIN-I-FUL
We're not confused.
I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
Well, then put him at the singles table.
Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
I'm sorry, Miles.  So I don't know where that leaves us. I'm not sure how much more mileage I can get out of continuing to submit it. I think it's one of those unfortunate cases in the business right now -- a fabulous book with no home. The whole industry's gotten gutless. It's not about the quality of the books. It's about the marketing.
My condolences.
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
Stephanie.
In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
Couple of wrong turns.  Thanks to Magellan, here.
No, we're paying for the wine.
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.
You said you had it all lined up.
I went on Monday. But I spent most of the time helping him with his computer.
Just a minute!
It does. Feels right.
It's going to be great. Here's to us.
Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
Shut up.
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.
Okay! Fuck!
Bathroom.
Right now.
This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
But you don't know yet, so your negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't you say?
I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.
He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.
We gotta slow down.  I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.
I don't have to.
Don't give up. You're going to make it.
No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
No way. No way.
My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
I'm fine. You rest.
You said it looked like a car accident.
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
You need a new car anyway.
Yeah.  Hey, why wasn't I injured?
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.
That's what I'm having.
Fine. Just slipped.  This is my blood.
She got anything good?
Is she sleeping or...?
Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
Well...
Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
I had class.
Well, nice to see you now.
Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend?
Do you know what he's been saying to her?
You fucking bastard! Lying piece of shit! You're getting married on Saturday? What was all that shit you said to me?
And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming.
She doesn't answer me either.
A hair.
Morgan took a sip. It has his amoebas in it.
He licks his butt everyday. He's not going to mind.
...Tell Bo to listen to her brother. He'll always take care of her.
...Tell Graham --
What?  Colleen?... Colleen?
Curse and stuff.
Explain noises.
I heard.
Yes, it was.
What time is it?
They're right behind the door.
What are you doing?
Me too.
Don't.
They win.
I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
No.
You take care of yourself...  Graham.
Yes... That's the first thing Colleen asked too.
It's like War of the Worlds.
Yeah, I kissed a girl and this guy didn't like it and we had some words, so I decided to get out of there.
I already did that.
My name is Emmett.
And you're not Baxter, either?
Not for five years.
No, Leavenworth.
Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. I always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. I guess they admired my horse. She's a great one, a sweet little bay.
Where's Turley?
Oh, I was just checking the, ah...  ...you know, lookin' in.
Believe it.
What's that?
I want to build something, make things grow. That takes hard work -- a lifetime of it. That's not why men come to a pretty woman.
I've got no reason to run. It was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses.
All I did was kiss the girl.
That ain't right.
I don't like that word much, Carter.
We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.
You're kidding.
I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay.
Good luck, Mal.
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
Not a thing. She's just a mutual friend.  But if you wind up on the wrong side of this, she's going to get hurt.
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
Who's the owner?
Here he comes right now.
Cobb's got something on you, and it must be pretty good.
I'm ready for that.
We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera.
We don't need a name.  We'll cast an unknown.
The public decides who's on that list.
We can hardly make a profit with them.  Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine. We're at their mercy.  We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date.  When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!
-- It's called a projector.
Spare me.
You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
Good to see you too, Elaine.
Out of the question.  A circus like that?
She's my actor.  There are other studios, Elaine.  There's only one Simone.  Leave the press conference to me.
"Forever".
-- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.
Even the fall from the plane?
Who else?  It's always Simone's idea.
I'd love to tell her myself.  When are you going to let me meet her?
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
Viktor, you should have said something.
Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start.
About now.  Would you like a drink?
No, there isn't.  There's nothing to her.
You?
-- No, no, I didn't trip over her. You don't understand --
-- You just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you. Maybe she's staying out of pity, who knows?  She certainly doesn't need you.  Some people even say you're holding her back.
Exactly.  Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.
No... it's life.
Where are you?
Sometimes.  But, just when I think your father's changing for the better, I realize he's as self absorbed as ever.  He took the credit for Simone tonight.
Because obviously she existed, right?
Of course.  What are you suggesting?
No, thank God for you, Mr. Taransky.  How many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?
Is that a problem?
Nudity has just never been an issue for me, Frank.  For me, clothes are just an option.
You're so far off!  Hal... Hal Sinclair... your co- star.  Remember now?... No, I don't think he's put on weight.  Anyway, you think he's right for "Eternity Forever"?... not the right type?... a different direction...  I'll try to talk her into it.
I know what you mean.
I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked skin.  I licked hair.  I licked every part of her.
I have your new leading lady...  ... right here in my pants.
That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
Good and bad.  They think that's what caused this.  Me eye tumor. Microwaves from the screen.  It's the size of a grapefruit.  Heavy too.
-- We call them "vactors".
-- a living, breathing actor -- I can't work with a fake.
It can -- with my new computer code, you and me, we can do it together.
An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.
I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.
She still with Kent?
Why?
I read.
Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
No, not that.  I was just wondering -- in the bedroom scene in reel two why did Simone have no reflection when she walked in front of that mirror?
Lainey, you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship.
You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood.  You've killed an icon, for God's sake.
It was premeditated -- I knew exactly what I was doing!  I strangled her!  I bludgeoned her! I set her on fire!  I did it!  I killed her!
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
-- I bet you have.
-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.
Obviously the name isn't real -- she's using an assumed identity, travels under a false name, checks into hotels with an alias.  She never stays in the same place two nights in a row.  Anything on the satellite photos?  What about the fingerprints?  What happened when we dusted that hotel suite?
I will when you're finished writing it.
Could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
You're in breach.
After I saw what Simone did with the role -- you know I fired all my people, went into rehab, took acting classes, changed my whole look.  She really inspired me.
No, of course not, you're right. That would be crazy.
Do you know how important this is? This is big time.  I'm going to read it for you, doctor.
You use needles?
You saw that on T.V., Cole?
I forgot myself.
Yes.
It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was...  I was a fake.
Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... And then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. No one asked them. It's just gone...
I guess she did.
And you know what else?
Don't get mad.
Someone got hurt.
They did?
Dead people.
Dead people?
Got it.
It's our pleasure.
Chuck E. who?
Superstition.
Tramp.
Bitch.
Not according to these.
Which street corner?
The hell with this.  I'm coming back up!!!
Not someone -- Mac.
Two hundred bucks?? Are you crazy?
Metaphysical question, man.
"-- an AXE!"
Hi Suze.
Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it.
Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
Maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel.
"Blood?"
Amends...?
Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.
Yeah. Our own. I don't see why we got to go along for the ride.
Fuck you! Who cares what sandwich the bitch was eating?
Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
-- picked tonight to come by and watch our set.
I bet if he were still alive, he'd like to watch.
Getting ready.
Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --
Listen to me --
Suzie --
Like your guitar break.
Last night... he tried to get it on with me.
And that makes you look like a squid?
Hey, Grant.
When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
That wasn't a good night, no.
That's the mystery of the ages there, Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was, like, in his thirties. No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger.
Think we should get up a search party, head in there?
Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
What can I do you for?
How many you need?
Work thing hell, Starla. He just wants to get in your pussy. Him and most these other ones around here. That's where their minds is at, them sick fucks.
I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
My present?
I can make it to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours... that's no sweat.
How much style?
You paying for the gas?
All sound reasons for matrimony.
Kate McConnell. Sweet, shy... well- dressed. I'm giving her a lift to the next waterhole.
Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle.
Would I lie to you?
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
Then let's change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing?
I know.  Bandit two, bring yourself on in.
Ummm?
Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.
And?
Now, if I say go to channel three, it really means go to six.
Twenty-one is nineteen.
Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
What's your twenty?
I'll drop off my fare, hit a quick choke-and-puke and be blocking for you pronto.
'Bout fourteen miles this side of Mississippi.
-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...
I'm cucumber cool.
Go head on, breaker.
Pick it up, Breaker.
What's up, Dixie Chicken?
What else?  Can you give me cover, Mister B?
I'll keep my eyeballs peeled.
Congratulations. You just became a legend maker.
-- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
What kind of personnel?
Mortal.
No.
He uh -- he asked about -- I'm -- he wanted to know whic-- what floor security was on, then I saw him get on the elevator with the other agent.
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
Yeah.
Ww... uh...
You were here huntin' a man named Israel, weren't you? Your name is Tremor.
Yeah, why.
Your attitude sucks.
Cinnamon roll? No, good guess though. No, Hugo that looks like jizz...  And I'm no forensic expert mind you, but that looks like some fuckhead shot their load on a twelve-thousand dollar calf's skin jacket. The twist? It's My twelve thousand dollar, calf's skin jacket.  So y'got semen, human ejaculate --  -- that's been allowed to soak in for what, six, seven hours now? Work it's way into the fabric-fuck'n fibers -- and while you may never see it in a Tide commercial, I think it still safely qualifies as a "tough, deep down stain."
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
That's Mecklen. The deal's closing. I can pick that phone up and I can work this out.  You'll walk with me.
Bullshit it is. I said, about as loud as I could say it, "no jail time for my guys."
You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
-- will be handled back in --
-- no, we need to handle it now.
-- Brought against Sparazza by Israel's mother Laverne who was nineteen at the time. They had a brief affair which Israel was the by- product of.
...Almost.  What do you mean "who Sparazza actually was..."
It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
I wouldn't go that far.
I'm here.
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
-- okay, g'head --
Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
Wow.
Well just so I got a quote in my head. What's the rate for the Swede?
Cold blood Sid, dead eyes, y'know?
It's gettin' done Sid.
True?
Damn, this kevlar ridin' up on me, I wish they made this more sheer.
-- I don't know, I feel like you always pushin' up on me, gettin' close and I love you baby, in every way you can love a bitch, 'cept that one.
...What are they doin' right now...?
Who, here, could possibly care what you want?  At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction.  They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you?
The same thing that could happen to any of us.
No, she won't.
Why would you let her to do that?
You fucking bastard...
How?
Why, who did you see?
Told you what?
That's ludicrous.  This is contact. We have found God.  The only issue is figuring out how to prove this in a way that will make sense back on Earth.  So how will we describe it, if we choose to describe it at all?
I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
Who are you trying to convince?
What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
I'll just be a minute.
Better.
Let's go home.
What do you mean?
Is it intelligent?
You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
I did too.
I know.  I'm putting that in my next report.
He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
I'm glad.
You don't love me.
I'm just trying to understand what's going on.
Don't.  I'm the one at risk here. If we're playing out what happened before, I won't survive.
You're lying.  I'm not human.
You exist here.  I keep telling you.
Who are you, then?
I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.
We want to talk freely.
It's an experiment.
And when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the... original, the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness.
You go ahead.  Of what I remember about Earth... it's all one thing now.  Everything's a blur.  I like distinctions.
I'll come with you.
Sooner, the better.
He said he'd kill me.
That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?
It's just me.  I want to talk to you.  Let me in...
Stop being nuts!
What do you want to do?
Pretty bad.
It's Venza.  He wants you.  You, for Ellie and Tommy.
So.
Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
Unbelievably handsome.  You look fantastic in a suit.
Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?
El?  I'm sorry.  I do love you.  And you are a lady.  I have so much respect...
It should've been me...
I can't do it, you know that... He's not gonna allow it anyway, Mike.  No way is he gonna let anybody walk out of that house alive, who can finger him.
I don't really see what that has to do with...
I'll prove it!
Scrambled eggs surprise?
Just "lay back, Mack"... lay back...
I don't think she can sing, either.
Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
Flash, drop it--
I was sort of hoping to get out of--
Hm.  What a lump.
Harry!
Let me guess.  The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship.
Mm-hmm.
That's not even close.
Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
Fine.
Well...
Even if they're not clever.
That wasn't clever.  That was just nasty.
Oh, don't do it on my account--
No, it wasn't only you-- it -- it just wasn't my style.  Hey, look-- let's go to lunch.  Someplace nice for a change.
That was then.  I'm better since the lobotomy.
Do you mind if I come too?
Well, no.
Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
I'm here...
Waldos.
I know him.
I'll introduce you.
Use a fork.
See?  You big dullard.
Aunt May, what happened?
Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
Power down.  I need to talk to you.
I will finish what I've begun
You're wrong.  Just for a moment, I heard, saw, felt-- I became Creation.
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
Oh. Yeah.  Thanks.
If you really apply yourself, you'll get an A next time.
Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk then.  Bye.
Yup.  Oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  Solid, solid novelty act.
Forgive me if I don't feel too sympathetic right now.
No, but I've got this secret identity to worry about. I'll swing the rest of the way.
I see.  Well, Octavius won't get much further. They'll catch him and... put him away.  Sad.  He might very well have the truth.
Sure, in the war.  Pull those cables--
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
We did not.
Forget it. He'll be back here. They've got no proof.
Looks good outside.
How come the Krauts knew about that stove, Security? And the tunnel? How come you can't lay down a belch around here without them knowing it?
Forget it.
Which one of you is what?
You are talking crazy!
Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.
Abfuehren!
I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
You will remember the name? Von Scherbach? VON SCHER-BACH!
Jawohl?
Jawohl.
Droppen Sie dead!  Raus mit dem Ofen. Los! Los!
Stop it, Harry!
Comrade! Comrade! Otchi Tchorniya -- Otchi Tchorniya!
They'll shoot you, Animal!
Let go, Animal! It's chow! We'll miss chow!
How? Pinky Miller from Barrack 8 tried to get over there and they shot him in the leg!
Bombs away!
You don't want to cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive! Snap out of it!
Good.
What radio?
Are we boring you?
Who did?
Thirty-fifth.
Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
Ach, terrible! Such foolish boys. Such nice boys. I'd better not talk about it. It makes me sick to my stomach.
Here. Take them.
And how about three hundred cigarettes for yourself?
I do not want those cigarettes.
Yes, you do!
Give it back. You must not arouse yourselves.
Why don't we just plug up that tunnel -- with the Kommandant on one end and you on the other.
Maybe those Russian dames would take him.
Okay, Herr Preismaier, let's have the mail box.
It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
What happened to you?
I don't understand.
I can't leave. I'm already there, remember?
It's our pleasure.
I hadn't planned on it.
What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
Phasing? To where?
An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
I always do.
I told you everything. You might as well just kill me right now.
As ship's counselor, it's your duty to know not only when you're needed but also when you're not.
My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
There's nothing selfish about pursuing your own life, your own career.
We're doing the best we can. Now if you'll excuse me...
The thought had crossed my mind.
Not if it means killing over two hundred million people.  I wonder, did your wife Leandra know that she married a man who was capable of mass murder?
What if I told you I found a new truth?
Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory? It doesn't make any sense.
Plasma coils...is there any way we can use that to our advantage?
What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...?  Chekov, break radio  silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban.
Locate.
I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender. Genesis doesn't work! I can't believe they'll kill us for it --
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
My readings indicate great instability.
David --
So, like your father, you changed the rules...
I don't understand.
"... If the Captain decides that the mission is vital and reasonably free of danger." I know the book, Saavik.
Scan for vessels in pursuit!
Aye, sir!
Aye, sir!
And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
. He will remain always as he is.
Much is at stake...
The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott?
I think it's an energy form, sir...
Wait! Give me a chance --
No tricks. I'm looking forward to meeting you. Kirk out.
Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was "in death," Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him.
Yes, I was...
Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!
Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
... The needs of the few...
You will find a way, Kirk. If you honor them both, you <U>must</U>.
I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
Understood, my lord.
Success, my lord.
<U>We are Klingons</U>! Once you control the ship, I will transfer my flag there. And we will take Genesis from their own memory banks!
Wait!... Wait...
How is that...?
A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space.
Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.
I'm not a drama critic.
For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.
I'm your doctor and I'm your friend, Jim. Get back your command. Get it back before you really do grow old. Before you turn into part of this collection.
As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds.
Computer. Request security procedure and access to Project Genesis Summary.
I got beat. We're only alive because I knew something about these ships that he didn't.
This one looks like a Steward. They're not warm, but rigor hasn't set in. This didn't happen all that long ago, Jim.
We each face death every day we're alive, Saavik.
En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened?  <u>Has something happened</u>? Do you read us?
All went well. Nothing has happened. Ceti Alpha VI has checked out.
How can you ask me that? Were we together? Where we going to be? You had your world and I had mine. I wanted him in mine, not chasing through the universe with his father.
Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI --
What's the matter -- ?
Never mind! Hurry!
Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's completely mad, Admiral. He blames you for the death of his wife...
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
I'm Doctor Marcus!
I didn't expect anything.
Only half of you would get there.
KHAN!
First things first, Captain. Kill Admiral Kirk.
No promises, Mr. Scott. On your way.
I see. Well, shall we start with the engine room?
To be sure, Captain.
But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...
Yes.
Aye sir --
That's it?
I have an urgent CommPic from Space Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr. Carol Marcus.
Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons do not take prisoners.  Captain.
Very well.
And why not?
There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
Phasers on stun. Move out.
If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground.
Stage Two of what?
All stop, sir.
Dismiss the company.
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
Ready, sir.
Aye, sir.
By the book...
As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.
To Earth. To offer testimony.
You do this -- for friendship?
Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
Gillian --
If you have a better idea - now's the time.
Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.
Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank...
There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
Hamlet, Act I scene 4.
Sir, heat shields at maximum!
Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm:
Is there something wrong with the one I have?
It's perfect, Spock: a male, a female, together in a contained space can beam them up together and consider ourselves damn lucky...
The hell you were, buster. Your friend was messing up my tank and messing up my whales...
We don't want to be any trouble.
What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.
Well, that's something. I'da let you off right here.
Then --
Very likely. You're not exactly catching us at our best.
If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?
I told you: I'm a sucker for hard luck cases. Besides, I want to know why you travel around with that ditzy guy who knows that Gracie is pregnant and calls you Admiral.
Who do you think I am?
Here... In the park?
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.
... You have a point...
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
You mean this is -- goodbye?
Don't worry. I'll find <u>you</u>.  See you around the galaxy...
Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
A distinct possibility, Admiral. The President did say the transmission was directed at the Earth's Oceans
The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
There is one, but I cannot guarantee its success. We could attempt to find some Humpback Whales.
But you said toxic.
We could rig a device to collect their high energy photons safely; we could then inject the photons into the dilithium chamber, causing crystalline restructure.... Theoretically.
About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them.
They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail.
Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
Sir... Braking thrusters seem to have fired.
Go, Mr. Sulu.
Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can --
Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.
About 60 feet, Admiral.
Humpbacked - people.?
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
Oh I see --  Tell Them phasers on stun. Good luck. Kirk out.
Mr. Sulu, if you please.
No power to the bay doors.
It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
Admiral, you'll be trapped!
You will be in good hands here.
Of course.
Sill? What else would I be working with?
... But it would take years just to figure out the dynamics of this matrix...!
There are days.
This is a school... that's a student's work.  She'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans...
I can't imagine what it would be like to be a machine.
But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt?  A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet.
Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?
Why not...?
Tournel will take you the rest of the way...
Bye.
Data doesn't breathe.
No.
And our people?
Good. Let's begin to move these people out...
I believe it is safe, sir.
Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk...
I prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the Federation...
That is not an acceptable option. If people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation...
What kind of concerns?
We haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. They're calling this whole area The Briar Patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. Just get me Data's schematics. I'll keep you informed.  Dougherty out.
The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.
There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
Do you know how to disable the injector?
I'm sure. Just don't forget what they did to us.  We'll have them rounded up in a day or two... we needn't bother with the Federation holo-ship any more. Just get the holding cells ready.
We're not waiting until morning... take the shuttles and get everyone off the surface tonight.
May I talk to you alone?
If we don't outrun them, the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship.
Options?
On screen.
Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters.
Hmm? Oh, it's just something my mother used to...
Make it so.
Very well. We'll take an hour. Break out some rations...
Can you beam him off?
You have two days to become experts... Mister Worf, your job and mine will be to find a plan to safely capture Data.
If that's true, they're a dying race.
Or you could try lying down.
Your scanners must be malfunctioning.
All ship functions are off-line.
Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp.
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
Yes...
It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread...
We have two... but we don't have the juice to run them.
That's because you haven't been properly... stimulated yet.
I... do not want this...
No... no, please... you cannot...
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery.
We still have to make reports on ten more crewmen killed in action. Maybe you should deactivate your emotion chip until we're done.
Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.
I have the password right here.
If there are other photographs... I think I may know how to find them.
It'll have to wait. Come on.
What's still there?
I'm on it...
One minute to warp threshold...
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
Jean-Luc Picard.
Not really. I was born and raised right here. Never had much use for travel.
Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
I can try.
What makes you say that?
Don't flatter yourself. I take pictures of a lot of junk.
We?
On screen.
Data, set a course for that vortex.
Aye, sir.
Life signs?
Agreed. Options?
Right.
I think Mister Worf is suggesting that we go outside for a little stroll...
Speak for yourself. One day... one night...
Bones, are you afraid of the future?
I didn't mean this future.
No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
More than ever.
Don't remind me.
And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
The drink WAS served...
Did you have occasion to refer to your ship's data banks during that night?
Do we report this, sir?
Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
Kill him! He's the one!!
And your coat.
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
Candidate for what?
Come on, Saavik, you COULD knock -
Surely not.
We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon ship that's bringing Chancellor Gorkon here, and escort him safely through Federation space.
How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
I was asked by my father to open neg-
They're dying.
Perhaps you're right.
What peace conference?
This is Enterprise. We surrender. Repeat  Enterprise surrenders --
I'm going aboard. Spock, you have the conn.
Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
Faith...?
A lie?
No, sir.
I think  not.
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
Not from us!
They you're talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction, Mr. Spock.
Yes, sir.
Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
No.
Indefinitely.
Not tonight, I have work here.
Mister Worf, accompany Data please.
On my way.
He believes he has our communications protocols. But they will give him inaccurate locations for all Starfleet vessels.
Aye, sir... This way.
Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?
But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.
Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
Thank you.
As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
I don't believe that, sir. Weve shared many disappointing journeys.
Is he sincere about wanting peace?
Counselor?
Your timing is impeccable, Commander.

Thank you, Commander.
I'll take care of it, sir.
With or without the rest of the fleet?
Understood.
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
What sort of signature?
Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-seven photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary phased shields.
Thank you, sir...
The Praetor's power has always been the Romulan fleet. They must be behind him.
She's a predator.
Anything.
Unity, Captain! Tearing down the walls between us to recognize we are one people. Federation and Romulan. Human and Vulcan and Klingon and Reman. I'm speaking of the thing that makes us the same. We want peace.
And the Senate supports you?
Then perhaps the time has come to add some illumination to our discussion. Computer, raise lighting four levels.
You know I need to verify this.
As happens so frequently here on Romulus, a new government came to power. They decided to abandon the plan -- frankly, I think they were afraid I'd be discovered and it would lead to war. They weren't ready for that.
No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence.
Why am I here?
I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile. 
I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation.
Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
Runs in the family.
Let's go.
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
FULL STOP AND FIRE !
None.
And mine is wearing thin, young man! We supported you because you promised action. And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while--
It's there. The fog's thicker now, but it's there. What do you think started those fires?
Thirty-seven fifty for one person, forty-nine fifty for two.
We're only going to be here a few hours...
No.
And don't be shy about your English. You speak better than a lot of people I know.  Take care of yourself.
I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...
Neither did I.
Yes. It's kidnapped a woman at gunpoint and from what we can make out is forcing her to drive it somewhere.
It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband.
Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
You just do your job, Shermin. We'll make the policy.
We have a new directive. I'm taking over.
That's the chance we have to take.
Get a highway patrol unit over there.
He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone.
Don't... don't do this... please...
What.
Gear shift.
Smile... good?
No gas.
I am Jenny Haydn.
Up there... I... eh... can't explain...  But that's the only place you could be from.
My... husband.
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.
Oh God! You're going to get us both killed. Okay... in your pocket...
Okay.
You didn't even see it.
I need you.
I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep...
No... The closest...
What is hitchhike?
That's easy. I'll explain that in a minute. This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. You will ride to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
The car will stop?
Yes.
Goodbye.
Yes?
It was a mistake.
Yes?
The captain...
The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
Not all... but it feels like a kiss.
We're hundreds of miles from where you have to be.
Where did you learn that?
You can stop. I will go on alone.
But...
I understand.
What will you say about us?
Yes.
No, thank you.
I will wave to you.
I said I would get you to your ship and that's where we're going to say goodbye.
Call the police!!
Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like that?
Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
It was only an accident that we discovered them.
It was a man though... right?
Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car.
I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times.
Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.
Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car.
A tragic story, no doubt.  How'd you get up here?
I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
Jesus.
Hey, he was going to kill you.  And this ratfuck paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass.
Uh huh.  And I said, 'That's good, because I like the feeling of someone watching me.  I acquired the taste from Lenny.'
Make me forget it, baby.
That's a good one, coming from you.
Maybe.
It's you up on that stage, not him. You don't need him.
Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
No.  Mace is in this.
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
Talk to me about costs, here.
Least you can do.
I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?
So've I.  Too much.
W'sup, Max?
Thanks, buddy.  See... things weren't bad enough.  They weren't fucking bad enough!
Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
I intend to.
I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says...
Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
Iris, man.  Pay attention.
Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives.
Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
Define illegal.
In LA?  Are you crazy?
Macey... I've never seen you like this.
I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.
Look, I gotta get some sleep.
Jesus, Lenny.
This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts.
You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?
That's where it gets a little strange.
And what about the guy that was following me?
Now you're really getting paranoid.
It's okay, Lenny  They'd never get here in time anyway.
Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left.
Good, Lenny.  I can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  Come on.
No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
Uh unh.
Then we'll be right where we are now.
Take the tape to the cops.
Yeah.
I know how the Feds like to sit on information. I got something in the car to show you.
Oh Jesus, Sheriff, I am sorry. I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news.
No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border, Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested?
Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there, no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?
Got a sister like this, what they call it, anal? That's her.
Hi there.
Winona.
We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
I have 6 tons.
I don't mean to be rude, but...
About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
You know, you ever think about other women?
Why me? What do you want from me!?
Yes.
Nada. Vague description, that's all. Fine-tooth-combed Speck's car, the diner: no fingerprints, no trace evidence.
At the field office.
Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room, spook these guys with stupid questions, blow my cover? -- no way.
What I do requires confidentiality.
I'm hesitant to...
We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated, it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We, the Director and I, decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero.
We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.
You're as crazy as he is! He's right! You don't give a damn about saving lives at all! Fuck you!
You're a disgrace to law enforcement, to the Bureau -- and to me.
How did a girl like me end up in a place like this?  The Deputy Director here, he believes in Tough Love. A cop's cop. Shape up or ship out, righto? Agent Kulok, when you get a chance you might want to check the victims of the recent serials. You'll find that some of them have been credited to other killers, some years ago. That's a Dave Koessler trick, find a pliant sociopath, preferably a dead one, attribute to him unsolved cases, clean up the backlog-looks great in the yearly report.
Five months. I love it.
This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
That information's being withheld from the media.
It explains a lot.
My guess: he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae.
Because you asked him to, stupid.
Oh yeah, I forgot.
Just routine stuff.
We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
Oh.
Suspect Zero.
And you're working with him?
You're putting me in a difficult position.
All the same killer?
Sit back.
Please. You can't hide from me, sonny. I invented the questionnaire. I can tell those who talk from those who do it in the time it takes you to fart.
I already have an employer.
If I owe, I will go.
George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
I want to go live with you.
I screwed up twice, sir.
Yes, sir.
Got a vehicle?  Head north on 54. When you get to New Mexico you've gone too far.
This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
Brilliant? You think he caught any of them because he was brilliant? Hardboy? MyDick? Imelda? Ripper? Think about it, how did he locate them?  He found them as Murman. And how did Murder Man find them? With sweet talk and brains? No. He did it with souvenirs. He took them into private rooms, swapped goodies: pictures, panties, jewelry, body parts. Snuff downloads. As bait. That's why I never exchanged with him. He killed girls, oh yeah, harvested them. He had the best stuff. Richard Low is Murman and Murman is one of us.
You're right. I know.
I'm sorry?
What kind of car do you drive?
I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. Let me make it up to you.
I'd say about two weeks.
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that?
...and even then...
What else is going on?
He is so sweet.
I'm a comedian.
There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...
Yeah. And an actor.
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
...Which one...?
...get the hell outta here already...
I can call back...
That's okay. I wanted to talk to you.
How are you doing?
What kind of things?
I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye.
The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. You can only do things to make her not want to come back.
Right... or more likely the opposite.
Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
Thanks. Thanks, man.
It's like "Hi, Mom. I'm not going to be starring in that sitcom and, oh by the way, I'm Goofy. Send more money."
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
I'll give you an eight. 
To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.
I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them.
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
Him?
What's the point?
Hey Sue. Gretsky's on his ass again.
Make someone bleed.
I can't believe you.
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike, again. I just called because it sounded like your machine might've cut me off before I gave you my number, and also to say sorry for calling so late, but you were still there when I left the Dresden, so I knew I'd get your machine. Anyway, my number is... 
Hi, Nikki. Mike. I don't think this is working out. I think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. It's not you, really. It's me. It's only been six months...
Mike?
Coffee...  Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
We're going to Vegas.
Tonight, baby.
Just bring your card. Half an hour.
Okay Bugsy. Twenty minutes.
Look at it, baby. Vegas, baby!
You gotta love the pirates, baby. The pirates are money.
Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
You gotta do it.
Thanks for clarifying that.
Let's just leave.
She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
I know she's coming back.
You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there.
...gotta...
They know what you want, believe me. Pretending is just a waste of time. You're gonna take them there eventually anyway. Don't apologize for it.
You did fine. Don't sweat her. We're meeting our honeys soon. You know Christy's friend is going to be money.
Baby, we're money.
Hello, Lisa. I'm Trent. What a lovely makeup job.
Well... we're not in Kansas anymore.
"Big Brother", "Little Brother"?
Yes!
No! Not the camera guy!
Right?... that I nailed it... Whatever. Then he says it's just that I'm a little old. I'm like "How old is the Brother?". He's like, he says this with a straight face, I swear to God, he says "Eleven."
What?
I gotta use the phone.
I didn't even like her, to be honest.
I don't know. The whole Judy Garland thing kind of turned me on. Does that makes me some kind of fag?
I don't think so.
Yeah, a good friend.
How?
That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
...a day...
Selling scrap metal.
This version doesn't have fighting?
No. Doesn't that suck?
What's wrong? I saw you talking to that beautiful blonde baby.
We're not messing with you...
A day.
You were good. Did you see how she was vibing you?
That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.
Is she looking now?
...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
...and big fuckin' teeth...
...you're like a big bear.
...Yeah.
Don't listen to him. You call whenever it feels right to you.
But your daughter is still alive.
Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
The guy at the gate's outside...says there's a package...
Sure.
Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month!
I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences.  Be my friend.
And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family?
I'm not rich anymore, Godfather, and...my career, I'm almost washed up...
It's from Johnny.  It was announced this morning.  He's going to play the lead in the new Woltz Brothers film.
I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
Maybe I can help.
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
There are men in this world who demand to be killed.  They argue in gambling games; they jump out of their cars in a rage if someone so much as scratches their fender. These people wander through the streets calling out "Kill me, kill me."  Luca Brasi was like that. And since he wasn't scared of death, and in fact, looked for it...I made him my weapon.  Because I was the only person in the world that he truly hoped would not kill him.  I think you have done the same with this man.
No...I would like to walk to Corleone.
We hear.  We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  Is your wife coming with you?
I know about what you mean!
Get rid of them...
Luca never sleeps over with a broad. He always goes home when he's through.  Mike, keep ringing Luca's number.
Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
An accident.  No one was hurt.
If I accept that letter and you told a Court of Law I accepted it, they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts. Just wait Kay, he'll contact you.
Mama, no.
Did he give you his politicians?
Who is he?
Then eat your spaghetti and I'll tell you a Luca Brasi story.
Michael, I love you.
...who out of sheer terror had swallowed the bath towel in his mouth and suffocated.
And what do you want for Christmas?
Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here.
How is your father?
Is it like they say?  Is he that good?
I don't need them, Sonny.  I'm just going to see Pop in the hospital. Also, I got other things.
You think I scam?
Sure. Any time.
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee.
Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog.  This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it?
No, still here.
Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
I'd pay you. If you would go to Italy and persuade my son to come home. I'd pay you $1000.
No, I think your mother, her illness --
It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for -- ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! -- it's got nothing to do with my mother.
This is the best. Marge says she likes jazz, but she things Glenn Miller is jazz.
I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?
This is so good of you.
See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.
You're breaking my ribs!
Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune anyway.
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
Dickie?
Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't.
What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else.
Didn't Dick say? -- He talked to Freddie... apparently it's not going to work out --  Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.
I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days.
Ha. Did he say why?
What does that mean?
Dickie did it.
No, well go if you want to, but don't talk to the Police about my face -- they find out he hit me -- he's got a temper -- he could've hit Freddie.  Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you later.
I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
A hotel would've been fine.  We'll have to tell Mr Greenleaf how far his dollar has stretched.
Excuse me?
Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.
Randall.
Right.
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R.
I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome.
Exactly. 10.30 -- 
Hello Meredith.
Hardly. I couldn't be less alone.
He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder.
Not at all. Morning Tom.
Hi.  Sorry. You okay? You look as if you've seen a ghost...
No.  By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient.
But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody...
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.
Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening.
Even her.
What about Thomas Ripley?
You have, yes.
I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a -- confronto -- line-up.  Tomorrow then?
Who mam?
Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
Well, Betsy mam, I drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day. And I watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones, and I say to myself, that's a lonely girl. She needs a friend. And I'm gonna be her friend. 
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
That would have been quite a coincidence.
You'd be surprised how often you see the same people, get the same fare. People have patterns. They do more or less the same things every day. I can tell.
Oh. Who was that again?
The singer?
He'll, what else can I do with it all?
Huh?
Oh, I got over that. It was nothing, really. The papers always blow these things up.  A little stiffness. That'll go away. I just sleep more, that's all.
The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
Oh, Tom, please.
That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious --
What taxi driver?
No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.
He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when --
Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something.
Just follow me.
No, I'm serious, really...
Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still.
Yeah.
You said that?
Support my kids. Can you dig it?  Nice to meet ya, Travis. So long, Wizard. Say hello to Malcolm X for me. 
I mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?
Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice, Travis.
But you're the one that wanted to get away. You're the one that came into my cab.
You can do it in my mouth.
Don't you understand anything?
I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
Don't you want to go?
But that one night?
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
You a narc?
Yeah.
You can't leave 'em to do the same to other girls. You should get rid of them.
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
There isn't time for that. In other words, you don't know.
I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you.  I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy.
There must be something...
I ride around nights mostly. Subways, buses. See things. Figur'd I might as well get paid for it.
We don't need any misfits around here, son.
You moonlightin?
Why do you ask?
What kind of guns do you guys use? .38's?
Sure.
Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
Shit.
It happens.
Travis, look, I dig it. Let me explain. You choose a certain way of life. You live it. It becomes what you are. I've been a hack 27 years, the last ten at night. Still don't own my own cab. I guess that's the way I want it.  You see, that must be what I am.
Neither do I, I guess.
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
You think I'm too...  ethnic for country music?
Don't let him do that.
I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.
You knew?  All this time?
You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete.  Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.
Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the Fifth Amendment pertains to self-incrimination, and I can't incriminate myself because I've done nothing wrong.  Besides, incrimination is why you have Mr. Clyde working for you.
Well...
Honey, I... I can't... it's the...
Me too.
Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
You must not remember anything. Come on.
Why me?
Yeah...
What?
Nine hundred...
Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
Huh.  That was nice of me.
No... I can't... I have to... I can't...
Yes it does.
I'm not refuting anything.
Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?
A statement?
Um... no.  I don't have a statement at this time.
I... I need a drink of water.
Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?
Exactly.  Break it to her gently.
I remember the picture... but I don't remember where I saw it.
Good to meet you.  Again.
And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
Harry, son.  Harry.
You joined up one month to the day after Pearl Harbor.  January seventh... nineteen forty-two.
Why?
"one fryer and two-dozen eggs?"
... what?
I know, I know... keep still.
Did I what?
Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
Thanks.  Well, Sheriff's on his way over, and maybe we can get to the bottom of who you are...
Evening, Doctor Lardner.
Even if we could, and the move didn't kill him, there'd be very little we could do there that we can't do here.  I'm sorry.
Jesus.
Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it don't matter who the hell "they" is.  "They" know who "they" are, that's all that matters.  Now, did you go to any meetings?
So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization.
I know.  A Purple Heart.
However... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles.  Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you.
Oh, I see.  But you're not Luke. You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer.
Sure.  Come on in.  I was just packing.
I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.
My girlfriend.  If she still is...
I'm Melanie Daniels. I'm sorry to bother you, but...
Cathy?
I guess that's where everyone meets him.
Where are you from originally, Annie?
When was this?
A trifle.
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
I did.
Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
I don't think so.  I have to get back to San Francisco.
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
Lois!
No, it's Lois!
Yes?
Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
Mmmm.
Where would I get a boat?
Impossible.
One apple pie! You want more coffee?
A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco.
She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
I know, Mother.
Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
I got them all, Mother.
Shhh. Shhh.
You don't have to.
He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
I lost my husband four years ago, you know.  It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.  I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep.  Do you think Cathy's all right?
Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
I think it might also matter to Mitch.
No, you got quite a mess here, I'll admit that.  Maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney  Seems a little pointless, though. Freak accident like this wouldn't happen again in a million years.  You want some help cleaning up?
Well, I...
Up on the coast. About sixty miles north of here.
About an hour and a half on the freeway. Or two if you take the coast highway.
Lovebirds.
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
How?
I didn't break that window!
No, San Francisco. What are you...?
Why... 
Yes.
I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and...
But you were coming up anyway, remember?
Look, Mr. Brenner...
...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
And you didn't come up here to see her.
Yes, I was lying.
Do you expect me to believe...?
Cheers.
Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
Are you staying?
Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
Take wing!
It was like that yesterday.
I'm frightened, Mitch.
How soon?
Well... well, how soon would you want them?
There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
No one called it a war!
Help how? What do you want to do?
They are incapable of organized warfare!
They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything.  They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
Yes.
Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.
You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.
But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
Well? And are you not a good student?
But I -- well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh and told her.
Now you run off and see that pretty Mrs. Marsh and explain to her.
I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
No room there. We'll have to set it between us.
You'll be a good doctor.  I know all about doctors.
Maybe there's another reason. Maybe you haven't friends enough. Could that be it, Georgina?
I can't.
But what makes a thought start?
This is a gift.
Would you bribe me to leave you be?
It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.
Eighteen persons they killed and sold the bodies to Dr. Knox at ten pounds for a large and eight pounds for a small. That's good business, Joseph.
I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
See, I heard you were looking for some guy with a scar. How's that going? You find him? Yes? No?
You sent them. I had no choice.
I'm not dying for your goddamn illusions. You got that? You think you and your girlfriend had some rosy future ahead of you? Bullshit. She was already bored, why do you think she was looking around? You're nothing, Corvis! Less than nothing.
"Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
Keep that thing away from me.
Guy dressed for Halloween?
I do. Every day.
Look, I'll tell you the truth. Jannie drove us and was supposed to drive us back, she has a license, but I mean... look at her.
Just hold on to me.
It still doesn't mean...
It's not what you think.
No.
I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another.  I understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship.
That was my first question.
We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
Yes.
I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."
Aw, gee, Mom -- I had plans to play with Mr. Carpenter.
Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you... I saw it!
Department of Commerce. She's a secretary.  They have a man they call the Secretary, but he isn't at all. My mother's a real secretary.  Mr. Carpenter -- now can we go see the space ship?
No foolin'? Will you?
Certainly.  Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
Why not, Bobby?
I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
Perhaps if you could explain a little--
Thank you... Have you any news?
Not very good news, I'm afraid.  The President accepted your suggestion and cabled the invitations for a meeting last night.  Let me read you some of the replies.  "The Premier wishes to inform the Government of the United States that it will be impossible for him to attend the meeting suggested by the President unless the meeting is held in Moscow."  "The suggestion of the President regarding the possibility of a meeting in Moscow would be unacceptable to Her Majesty's Government at the present time. Representation could be sent only if the meeting were held in Washington."  Well -- there you have it.
I will not speak to any one nation or group of nations.  I don't intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies and suspicions.
There's always somebody here, but today of course they've all got plans.
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
Jittery is the word.
Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions. Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon, but he wasn't in. Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind.
Goodnight, my dear.
Did you believe what he told you?  I have a reason for asking this -- a very important reason.
Before I ask you to be honest with me, perhaps I should be completely honest with you--
What time is it?
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
Yes -- Just exactly.
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
This one could save your life.
We don't ride with vampires.
Fine!  Stay here!
Santa Carla has become a haven for the undead.
Zero.
They're gonna book us.
Whattaya mean?
Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
I can't do that!
What?
Sam, don't --
No, I just like to read the <u>T.V.</u> <u>Guide</u>.  Read the <u>T.V. Guide</u>, you don't need a T.V...
You better not like him too much.
Michael, will you do me a favor this evening?  Will you stay home with Sam tonight?  I'm meeting Max for dinner after work.
Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
I guess no one cares what I got a job.
He's already gone to bed.
Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.
Must be a circuit breaker.
Not another word!  I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.
Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
I don't want to fight with you, Lucy.  Come on.  Let's give it one more try.  Dinner at my house, tomorrow night.  I'm cooking.
I thought you said they needed discipline?
Tonight.  At the boardwalk...
Because I love you...
I'm weak... Soon I'll need to feed.
Will you give Mom a break?
Okay.  I'll flip you for it.
Come on, Sam, you know before there were malls there was 'like the ocean.'
I... I don't feel any differently.  Do you?
And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?!  You can't predict this time of year...
Screw it, I'm going up anyway.
Well, who the hell you think wants to get in there with you?
Cut, bullshit.  Been pulled apart.
Now who'd go and do...
Who you trying to protect, mutherfucker?  I'm telling you this S.O.B. could be one of them.
That's good enough.
What?
It's getting late.  Hurry it.  I'm going to check the last few rooms.
And if it got to Clark... Clark could have gotten to anybody.
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
Started with six.  There'd be four others left.
No.
You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
Thought you'd feel that way, Garry. You were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma...  ... we'll do you last...
Then get a move on.  Childs, come with me.
And that was enough?
I'm sure a lot of you already know.
Couldn't be possible.  Must have weighted a ton and a half...
Anyplace but here.
You crazy?  He might be inside already?
Then we go after him.
So what do you make of it?
Who else could have used that key?
It's the generator I think!  No power.
Hear what?
I shouldn't have mentioned it.  We can't go there.
It frightens you.
Yes.
Imagine that... seems that little devil got my power relays...
Vox...
Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.
I'm going to end it, Alexander.  As we discussed...
As our bodies atrophied our minds... compensated.
Go back to where you came from.  Or die here.
I could tell them.  Warm them of what's to come.
I've only read about them -- and the new internals.
What?
I need to... um... talk to you.
Hold on... I know I have it...
No... let's walk through the city.
Do you know you were humming?
I was not.
Alex, this is your first year as an associate professor.  You might want to play things a little more conservatively.
That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.
Then why are you here?
I live with it every minute of every day.
You don't know that.  You couldn't possibly.  If I'd only done this, or that, if I'd arrived ten minutes earlier, or later.  If we'd taken a different path or I hadn't fought the man for the ring.  You have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong.
Why don't you come to our house instead?
I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
Some.  But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.
Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
Good night.
And you saw a shape ahead of you...
It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
Yes.
Yes... I suppose so.
Mara --
Mara...?
Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
But I know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum.
I suppose so.
Yes, sir.
Now you are upsetting my fowl. Please go.
I am.  Are you a climber?
Goodnight, Mr. Philby.
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
[Pointedly] Of course you're not.
My business?
Yes.
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
How?
Because...because you came out and said something you couldn't have possibly have known. You came back and repeated three names...
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
What for?
I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table, lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then laughs nervously as she looks up.
No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them.
You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't.
[Beat, lost] No.
[Beat] I don't know.
What? How can you say that? He's the one that put you in that goddamn medieval...Jacket. He's probably the one who killed you.
Good. How's your mom?
Because I don't think I'm crazy.
You're not crazy.
[Beat] I don't know.
[Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.
I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
What are you talking about?
Why?
You don't have anywhere to stay?
Do you have a motel or something? Money?
Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far.
No, I'm ok.
No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow] Thanks.
May be easy to remember, but not easy to get. Being warm, maybe -- but, look, you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire. [Beat] And, being happy...you tell me if that's simple.
Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.
She fucked herself up day after day and then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette. [Beat] I came home from work and she was gone.
No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what we have for dinner.  I may not even make it home for dinner.  You know how Fridays are.
No you won't.  You'll be back today. Now!  You get your ass back here, Thelma, now, Goddamnit.  Thelma, do you understand me?
Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?
Yeah, I could too.  But... I don't know why I'm even asking you this. It's just... we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie. I don't know.  I keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable.  If just one person would say...
Alright.
Oh, great.
It don't matter.  Brains will only get you so far and luck always runs out.
What's wrong?
I'm spinning.
Thelma?  It's me.
A regular outlaw.
Louise, honey... Where are you?  You sound funny.
Not yet.
Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.
Call me back.
Who did it?
What?
Front.
No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're all upset.  It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess.  I wonder if Darryl's home yet.
Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.
Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
All of it.  That he tried to rape me.
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
Hmmm.  We gotta get some money.
Actin' like what?!  How am I supposed to act?  'Scuse me for not knowing what to do after you blow somebody's head off!
I suggested we go to the police, but you didn't like that; so, frankly, Louise, I'm all out of ideas.
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
My stuff's in the trunk!  God!  You care more about that car than you do about most people.
Most people just cause me trouble, but that car always gets me out of it.
Thelma, I'm going to Mexico.  I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass.  Are you up to this?  I mean, I have to know.  This isn't a game.  I'm in deep shit.  I gotta know what you're gonna do.
He said "Okay, Thelma.  I just wanted to know you were alright.  I hope you're havin' a good time.  You sure deserve one after puttin' up with me all the time.  I love you, honey."
Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm glad you had a good time.  It's about time.  Where is he now?
Try to.
No physical evidence.  We can't prove he did it.  We probably can't even prove he touched you by now.
Like a Chihuahua?
Those, too, but you know those little hairy ones?  Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth?
I mean, look how different he looks just since high school.  It's bad enough I have to get old, but doin' it with Darryl around is only gonna make it worse.  I mean, I don't think he's gonna be very nice about it.
Suck my dick... Boom!!
Sorry!
Yeah, you want it?
I said all that?
Yes, Thelma?
Eeuww.
Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?
We can live in a hacienda.
You're drivin'.
What?
Did you see that guy?!  He was right in the middle of the road!
They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
Go?
Yeah.  I been seein' you, too.
You got that right.
Fuck that.
Grrrreat!
You probably even called us beavers on your CB radio, didn't you?
He implied it.
Loser? You?
Each day is better than the next.  Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
Never?
You're kidding? What did they say?
His mother?
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
Well... at least now you know.
I'm sorry, it's just that you're taking this all wrong, pal. Don't you see? You're liberated. I feel liberated. I mean here you've been in therapy thinking you blew it with the greatest girl ever, and it turns out that getting your dick stuck in your zipper was the best thing that ever happened to you!
What?
Well think about it.
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
Copped a tin of Altoids at the car wash.
You jerk off before all big dates, right? Tell me you jerk off before your big dates.
No, thanks.  Love a little bundt cake if you have some!
Aw, Christ, I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna pack my bags and go back to my own place.
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
Thanks.
Tell Bill to get the fuck off!
Relax, he just ate.
You found my car?!
The sawbones?
Ahh.
Nepal? Have you been?
The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with.
Well it's more of an enclosure really.
That...? Vestibule.
How about -- ?
Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know it's corny, but I do love it.
You look great.  Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of these pants?
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
All you want is a phone number?
No.
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
So you found Mary?
Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
Uh, that's okay.
Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
Turn her over to a stalker.
You're a sick man, you know that?
Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be screwing myself.
Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition -- that's crossing the line!
You fucking prick, we had a deal -- you said you wouldn't fuck me and I wouldn't fuck you until we had this fuck out of the fucking picture.  You crossed the line, man.
I know how you feel -- I been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.
Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea -- it's a home run. You ever hear of Eight-Minute Abs?
Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you said you were putting her up for a month -- it's been a year and a half.
He's no Steve Young.
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
Kind of. Ted Peloquin -- one of the sweetest guys in the world.
Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
I've got a friend in the Boston police department. He faxed me this this morning. I'll just give you the highlights.  After a short stint as a petty thief, Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he committed his first murder -- a pretty teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He was incarcerated until age twenty-two when, despite a grim psychological profile, the state was forced to release him. In his mid- twenties and again in his early thirties he was suspected of homicides in the states of Utah and Washington. Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly decomposed that there wasn't enough evidence to hold him, and on and on and so forth and so on.
No, it's an old football injury.
Huh?
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
Oh... are you... ?
Hi, Ted.
I agree there should be more.
Ah, my roots here are too deep. I love my practice, the people I work with, Warren's got a nice thing going  Why don't you just move down here and marry me?
Toy poodle!
What did you think, Ted? That you could spy on me and trick me into thinking you were someone I could... really go for?
You're Woogie?
You forgot your keys!
But I think I'd be happiest... with you.
No, that's really unneces --
Oh.  Oh, that's a good one.
Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?
Teddy, be brave.
Eh.
Admiral, I asked you a question.
Yes, sir.
Yes.
Where the hell are you?
Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation?
We keep 'em in the dark as long as we can. But I sure as hell am going to test him.
You mean there's something more important than votes? Didn't think I'd live to see the day, Ken.
...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
They're going to be pressing for a military solution soon. We can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats. We need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here.
Something your father would've come up with.
What does the letter say?
No, Ken. I need to see him now...
You know I don't mean they're weak.
I said his heart, not his attention.
Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.
I'm doing a piece on Skybolt. I hear Macmillan's meeting with him in Nassau.
Let him talk to me, he makes Macmillan look good, I print it, the British public likes it, Macmillan owes you.
Yeah.
Today, for your information, is Pulaski Day. We're going to Buffalo...
There've got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them.
I don't know. I don't know.
We need those flights. We have to know when those missiles become operational, because when they do, we need to destroy them.
I'm gonna protect those pilots.
Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too.
And we can't purge the Chiefs. Our invasion talk will look like a bluff. Or even that there's been an attempted coup.
Then somebody'd better deny it publicly.
We've worked up several military scenarios. Before I ask General Taylor to lead us through the various options, I'd like for us to adopt a rule. If we are going to strike, we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational. Because once they are, I don't think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some are launched.
I'm afraid not, Mr. President. The sub has positioned itself between the Pierce and the Soviet ships. Admiral Anderson insists it's too much of a risk to proceed with stopping the freighters. The Pierce would be a sitting duck for the sub.
Just a second, Mr. President.
They can lead us to Jimmy. Just let them go. We're tightening the net on him. We know he's on the reservation.
No. No, that's Ray, here. Ray, uh...  Ray... Little Weasel.
-- did you understand me when I said that --
Check him out, Ray.
Beats the hell outta me.
Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars.
That's right.
I gave it back to her.
You weren't sent here to go off on your own detail, Ray. You were sent here to assist in a Selective Operations Unit. These regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to The Graveyard, to Indian Country. I need you behind me, Ray. Not pulling against me.
I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed.
He's out there. He's out there playing Sitting Bull with us. I want the motherfucker so bad I'm getting a bleeding ulcer.
Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
You didn't tell me about Red Deer Table --
Go back to the M.E., take a look inside Leo's exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there. Trust me, there ain't chickens in the Badlands. His mother's place is --
Medicine. As in medicine man?
Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster.
What you call myths, we call our history.
Cuz you're a cop.
Crow Horse, listen --
Sorry.
We've driven a long way. Where is this place?
What the hell do you want me to do?!
Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you wanna do this?
NO.  My father never told anybody he had Indian blood. But he still used a few Indian words around the house. He called me Washee. Said it meant... good boy.
Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
I read, Cooch.
They took it down, set fire to it, and threw it on the doorstep of room 13 at the Buffalo Butte Motel. Your room.
I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
Yeah. Hold this. It might be safer.
I could be, too.
Yes, ma'am.
On his six.
You know. The finger.
I don't mix with the boys. I work here. Let's keep it professional.
Give me a break, I'm asking you out.
You're an animal.
You ever think about killing another human being?
You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
Where?
And now I want you.
In that order?
You ever fly an F-14? 
Pawn shop. What's to eat?
That's what I want.
What kind of games?
Take something off.
I was, later.
I hope you find him.
Well what?
No sir! But you have to be ready.
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
You.
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
This is crazy!
What?  What is it?
You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
So, you're scared--so what? You ever get a good look at me in the back seat, I'm goddamn terrified.
Rudder's left, stick's forward.
The plane is fine.
MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST A FLYBY.
Any more MiGs?
Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking!
What do you think it was? Was it that MiG contact that did it?
Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
Tom Kazansky.
I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
He should've had me. GOOSE Take it down. Let's bug out of here. Call for a draw.
IT'S MY SHOT.
LOOK OUT!
WHEN I SHOOT, YOU BREAK LEFT..3..2
I think I can work it out on my own.
Yeah, we get one of these guys every damn class.   "Maverick!"
No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?
Sir?
That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
The rules of engagement are not flexible. They exist for your safety. You will obey them. Is that clear?
I know.
You may not think so, but you are.
It's not true.
He ain't got five kids to feed.
You're getting off to an early start.
Whatcha doin' to me, man?!  I got six kids to feed!
Thank you.
Would you like the same suite?
Get it, please.
Perfect, my ass!  --You pop your memory cap before we can activate you.  Then Richter goes hod wild, screwing up everything I spent a year planning. --Frankly, I'm amazed is worked.
Don't take my word for it, Quaid. Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
My friend, five minutes from now, you won't give a shit about the people.  Fire it up, Doc.
That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
No, sir.
Yes, sir.
It's about goddamn time.
It's not my fault.  We hit a memory cap.
I've been trying to tell you.  Someone erased his memory.
Don't you keep up with the news?  We're doing alien artifacts now.
Hmmm.  And how do you like your women?
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
I'm afraid you're not really standing here right now.
Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
That's right.
No need to be rude.  I'll do it.
Not since you lost him.
Wrong.  Kuato's a mutant.  So don't get upset when you see him.
What are you, my father?
I've got him.  The guy in the turban.
Aw, come on, baby...You're the girl of my dreams.
Lori, move.
There's lots nicer places than Mars.
And falling in love?
Bullshit.
Mars.
That a problem?
I'm not interested in that.
I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug. Just rest assured, by the time the trip is over, you get the girl, you kill the bad guys, and you save the entire planet.  Now you tell me.  Is that worth three hundred measly credits?
This is too weird.
I'm not falling for it.
Aliens?!
What?
...Who are you?
I think I scared it!
We sell 'em to you for three bucks a piece!
Burt, can you hear me now?
Damn it!  They'll sink this rig just like a boat!
Thanks.  God, I hope they're not screwed up.  I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.
I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
No.  We go straight.
Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment.
Forget it, man.  It's not worth it.
That's the plan.
Screw you.  For all you know they could <u>fly</u>.
So this is the guy that had your seismos working overtime?
Yeah.  Where's your truck?
Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
Jesus, Val, it's pretty far.
You're not civil, you're glum.  We got the world by the tail with a downhill pull and all of a sudden you go glum on me.
They're tearing down the houses here!  We all gotta get outta here together!  Now!
Ah, but consider this, if we don't finish the roof, we can looks at that sky all the time.
God, what a stink!
Yeah, geography.
Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
You okay?
Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars.
Absolutely not. No more than seven percent.
Bellevue. Straight up First --
Do you see a toilet here you think is really me?
Dowd. Eddie Dowd.
Hey -- the fact you popped Jimmy Chin in broad daylight proves it wasn't premeditated. Jury'll sympathize -- dude was banging your wife, right?
Oh really?
I didn't take my eyes off it!
We had a description of the suspect.
I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary.
Don't tell me where to work. I moved to New York to work for Edward Dowd. But I can't believe that Edward Dowd has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little --
Kim denied it. But he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. Seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with Duane Lindeman.
-- The Nazi he knifed?
Easy? No... We have to find some piece of evidence that got buried, to reopen the sucker.
...Are you sure we want that?
Eddie... I don't know about this...
So an upstanding member of the Aryan Warriors wouldn't paint them on. They take those teardrops seriously -- they're badges of courage, of honor. Only their most vicious killer elite get to wear them...!
A spinal injury, in the line of duty. It was in Kitty's report...
-- What?
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
... An hour.  That's why I thought the morgue was on the other side of town.
Neither.
Kitty, where exactly do you place the microphone to catch the most incriminating moans?
"...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"?
But I like that theory. And since I'm not putting Twerp Professor on the stand, and since I don't have a better theory, I'm sticking with that theory. Meantime I want pictures of the Joes. What'll you bet there was a guy in the gang looked enough like Shu to fool the eyewitnesses!
I'm a professional, Eddie. Getting paid is all the thanks I require.
Screw you too, Kitty.
I killed the motherfucker.
It was self-defense.
See-cil.
Y-yes, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Stipe.
Shu Kai Kim.
You won't remember this, but in '72 I was one of several prosecutors assigned to the Black Panther-Police Shootout.  We had a whole team, and you walked into court by yourself and kicked our collective butt.  So what've you been up to since then?
Isn't it a standard trick to pack a line-up with men who resemble each other but look different than the suspect, so the suspect will stand out for the eyewitnesses?
Calls for speculation.
If I were sitting where I normally sit, I would say "Calls for speculation."
Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
And who were the detectives who assisted you, Mr. Reynard?
I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.
No? Then what did he say?
-- What trial?
You mustn't talk to Art. You mustn't tell Art that I was at the trial. Do you hear me?
Mr. Ortega... What is "La Compania"?
A Cubano army, basically... inside and outside prisons.
And its purpose?
I would tend to plead the Fifth.
What is your rank within La Compania?
Cigarettes, candy bars...  PCP, crack...
That's right.
Chinatown. Sounded pretty cold...
That guy they arrested -- he was the wrong g-guy.
Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?
No shit...  We killed a guy for baby laxative.
Don't get funny with me again.
Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.
You're lucky I am not wasting you.
Well, little fella, let me put it this way. The operative word here would be "Federal". With or without the semantics of all this, I am now ordering you to release all pertinent information concerning Teresa Banks, both while living and deceased.
Out back in our morgue.
Thank you, Carl.
God damn, you people are confusing.
Did she have someone with her?
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
Not a lot around here, no. Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls.
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.
CHET, I AM CALLING YOU FROM PORTLAND... OREGON.
I'm up to speed, Stanley.
And neither will I.
Oh, alright.  You know, I liked Agent Desmond. He had his own M.O.
No.  Ask Irene over there.
What do you mean?
Yes, it's been several hours since we've eaten. I didn't realize that so much time had past, did you, Agent Desmond?
Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
Faster and faster. For a long time you wouldn't feel anything. Then you would burst into fire... forever.
Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D.
This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin?
Nothing.
Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
What can I tell you?
WE got it back, that's all.
And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
Yep...  Yes...  It is.
I already made you two tapes.
Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
Send me a kiss.
Let's go all the way.
Okay.
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
This afternoon?
Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
You want to see...
Right. Open your eyes, James. You don't know me. Even Donna doesn't know me. Your Laura disappeared... It's just me now.
We throw away the whole head.
But my name isn't Leland Palmer.
A special friend?
You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house.  Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you?
Laura didn't wash her hands before dinner.  And look at this.
I don't know.
Don't worry, Shelly, I'll handle Leo.
Four cases in three years...
No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
Well, of course, it's always dangerous...
And no one will know the truth.
...yes. Get her on the phone...
Mickey told him to call.  'He's some very hotshot surgeon at Mass. Commonwealth. He wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye. You meet him at the hospital.'
To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
Yes.  It is a crime. A serious crime.
I wouldn't do it.
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie. When were you lying?
You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
Orthopedics?
Objection.
...to get her heartbeat back...?
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Your Honor...! Your Honor...
Don't equivocate. Be positive. Just tell the truth.
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not?
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
Yes.
Tell us.
...What difference would...
It's my opinion it took him much longer. Nine... ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
I'm afraid that's not true.  Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
That's perfectly all right. I'm kind of rushed. Do you mind if we walk while we talk?
Right. Who called?
Her doctors killed her.
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
I understand.
How old is he?
Who told you that?
Mrs. Simmonds.
I was held up.
Are you done?
Damn right I'm done. I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
The TV didn't work.
They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...'
Maybe I can do something right.
What happened...?
Well, then what are you doing here?
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
What are you going to do?
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
I have to reach him. This is an emergency. Could you give me his home number?
Yes. Price...
Pardon?
We find that your subscription lapsed...
No.
I've got nothing to say to you.
And ask me what?
I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What do you owe them?
Yes. Yes, I have.
I don't want to leave her. Dick... the, the... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will...
Where is he?
No, no, no. I have to talk to him. If I can only call him...
...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them...
That's the point, you stupid fuck. Let them buy it. We let them buy the case. That's what I took it for. You let this drop -- we'll go up to New Hampshire, kill some fuckin' deer...
Read me what she said.
What difference can that make...? All right...
What did she do?
I don't know.
I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
She did?
You saw Kat in New York...  ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
...of the procedures...
Yes, the roving nurse...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Why did it take that long to get her heartbeat...
Because she was anemic.  It's right there on her chart. Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway...
That won't start no more fires.  We might's well go home.
We'd be in all the papers!
The same thing that happened on our Pacific Coast.  Anything from them yet?
All right - I've seen enough!
Well, I did a thesis on modern scien- tists - working for my Masters degree.
Aw, he isn't that good...!
Like...ah...
I have no close folks.  My parents died when I was a kid.
It was...  ...one of them!
I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!
It's blocked here, too!  They've pushed up earth or something all around outside.  Here, this way...!
My kid brother has one.  You know why?
You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
I believe we can get a lead from their anaemic blood.
Right.
Well-l...how do you do, Dr. Forrester!
I've done about all I can do here. You go back in.  Sylvia - I like that Doctor Forrester.  He's a good man.
D.O. to number three..come in.
Well, there's some fellows fishing at Pine Summit might be interested.  They probably saw it come down.  I'll let 'em know...What's it look like?
Everything human don't have to look like you and me....
He's not showing it until it's down.  But it sounds hot, and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is.  You and Robert got great ratings today. Which is the first thing we needed to know.
We'll work something out.  I'm sure you'll be happy with it.
Like weird calls, by any chance?
You get any sleep last night?
Guess so.
Don't speed, Chase.  It's not...
Was there any trigger event?  A trauma, shock or...  You haven't shown him any of the films you make, have you?  The horror stuff?
Is he all right?
Oh my God...
Just a quick word, Ms. Langenkamp.  For Dylan's sake.
This is going to give you nightmares.
The mean old man with the claws.
Rex woke me up. He was fighting.
Can you come with me in my dreams?
A story?
Everything went great, I thought.  We really got you, didn't we?
Holding my own.  You know that guy who was calling me all the time?  He's started again.  He's been putting stuff in my mail.
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
The way he's writing is so weird, who knows?  I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...?  Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God.  Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
The car's no there yet?
Dunno.  Just have this feeling today...
Captured?  How?
Do you let your child watch your movies?
Just take a minute.  You'll be glad you did, I bet.
He never would have believed a woman like you existed.
Guilty.
Claiming their place in the world.
A pretty young maiden she happened my way...
Yes, Sir.
Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
North, north-east.  And Dick, please make a note of our final position.
How old are you, son?
Okay.
No, I can't.
Whatever.
My old man split along time ago.  It doesn't mean anything.  You just take care of number one that's all that matters.
Yeah.  How'd you do.
Congratulations.
I'll tell you who you are.  You're the glue.  You're the thing that holds everybody around you together. You're strong, you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't.  It's a gift.
Me either.
I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve.
Like this!
We all have problems.
But that's not the point...
Ya know... "It".
Who?
You can't run from the wind son. You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall.  Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight.
I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.
So is violating international law.
Your cannons made a compelling argument.
Happily, it all worked out... This time.  Bill, take Philip below and help him find a bunk.
Take good care of my son.
Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
Why'd you jump?
I couldn't do it.
Barometer's dropping.  The first blow'll come from the south.  Might get interesting.
We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
I don't think one second of this is funny, sir.
The papers are going to eat you alive.  Even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission.  They want someone to be accountable.
I am accountable.
Screw you, Valentino.  I haven't seen you swapping spit with anybody.
Everybody knows why she went over Tod.  You jibed the boat.
Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
Y'all take American Express?
You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
Fuck me.
You black?
What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
No... She's fine. Back home.
We were. Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and I are on our way back to Utila, in the morning.
Call me Johnnie... N.O. has always been a good town to sit around in.
Don't know that I have... Should I know about you for anythin' in particular?
Guilty on a reduced charge. Hundred dollar fine and ordered to desist. Pigeons carry diseases and muss up the place. You seen it. Plain filth.
Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
Somethin' was upsettin' you bad last night, and you wanted to tell me and I figured you wanted to tell me so's I could help...
Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
See ya downstairs.
You ain't actin', mama.
And?
'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
It ain't altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes. Lula, I done a few things in my life I ain't too proud of, but I'll tell ya from now on I ain't gonna do nothin' for no good reason. All I know for sure is there's more'n a few bad ideas runnin' around loose out there.
Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.
Yeah, I suppose. But you know somethin' baby, hair does make a difference.
Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
Yeah, maybe...
I guess.
Thank the Lord. Well, you ain't let me down yet, Sailor. That's more'n I can say for the rest of the world?
What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.
That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?
Say what? Honestly, sugar, you can talk more shit sometimes?
How they used to do it. Course they got more sophisticated ways now. Radio said the Chinese, I think it is, figured a better idea is by insertin' a balloon in the forehead and lettin' it hang down on the nose.
Shhhhh... It's four o'clock... That woman's laugh the other day had somethin' to do with this feelin'?... Like bein' ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.
Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
I was hopin' you would. I know that night by heart. Sometimes, honey? I think it's the best night of my life.
Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
I'm goin'.
Just part of life on the road, peanut.
Maybe there's a place we could hear some music. I feel like dancin'. We could ask someone.
Under a hundred.
Oh shit...
It's a comfortin' idea.
I don't know... Looks like clothes.
Let's get outta here, honey.
Okay, honey, I'll see you later.
The only one.
Yeah?
Not that. Look at what I wrote down cause I can't say it.
Lula, he mighta did, I don't know. But it don't matter now. Lotta guys go outta control in a war and it ain't their fault.
Lead the way.
Are you comin' back here soon, Lula? I need you here.
Really, Lula, this ain't right!
Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
Mama, Sailor's in deep trouble here. I just can't leave him.
What time's Sailor's train get in?
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
What if I told you not to?
That's your business... I don't care how.
NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
Santos...
Where? In the leg?
No.
Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?
Santos... No... Please, Santos...
Santos... I can't...
Put your shoulders back, I said.
Well, she wants to fuck you.
It's a prob'lm I don't think's gonna go away too soon though... Peanut, I'm thinkin' of breakin' parole and takin' you out to sunny California.
I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.
Heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter.
Yeah... But I did... And I told you all about it...
Yeah. Like in Against All Flags. Only they use a couple big hams.
He's right, you look horrible.
I just mean...
He owes God money. You know, he queered himself for good with Esquire.
Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken legs.
On the contrary, it could be just the ticket.
Because... because...
He heard everything we were saying.
Tripp, where the hell...
Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
Good idea, Crabs. Only one problem. I don't know where they live.
Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack.
It seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas.
The hood jumper?
'That's my car, motherfucker.'
...we find the jacket.
That was MacCaulay.
He was never able to reproduce them.
I don't think so. In my experience, signs are usually a lot more subtle.
Jeff. Sorry. I didn't even know this was your house until about an hour ago.
I've been trying to finish a book...
And your wife left you.
Could you hold on a minute, honey?
You're in Kinship?
With Emily?
It's very convincing.
...You carry firearms.
No! What gave you that idea?
A little.
Really.
Does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
Whose tuba is that anyway?
Ah. I don't believe in writer's block.
Jesus, James. Wow.
Carvel.
Your father worked in a mannequin factory?
Thanks for the halo, James, but I've never done that much thinking ahead in my life -- ever.
James, fall semester, first day of class, it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat.
When?
When nobody's looking.
Okay.
James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
James is odd. I know he has an aunt in Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once, but...  Come to think of it, it wasn't even his Aunt's house. He said she worked there. Or something. I don't remember.
No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?
Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?
She's left before...
Simple.
You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her.
I love you, Grady.
Are you limping? Why are you limping?
Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
What's he doing out there?
And you're old.
I guess you have to go on faith.
That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
I'm in love with your wife.
Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
Hey, Professor Tripp.
I might have his number on campus.
No shit.
I like the noise.
I don't know. She won't talk about it.
You're the only one in the family who still talks to me.
It wasn't like that.
I don't like starlings.
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
Like a piece of shit? In my eyes, you are a piece of shit. Think anyone would miss you if I threw you out the window right now? I could say you jumped when I came in. Who are they going to believe? Not you, because you'd be a dead piece of shit.
Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?
Woodsman?
Know what?
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
Just give me a straight answer, Walter, cause the irony goes right over my head.
Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.
I count my blessings.
And your new apartment?
You are in.
I'm twelve.
A long time ago, I was sent far away. When they let me come back, all my friends were gone.
Are you sure?
Tell Ms. Kramer what your daddy does.
Someone will talk to your daddy. And then he'll stop doing those things... the things you don't like.
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
It's getting dark. Go home.
You seem a little hostile today.
I'm still thinking about it.
Maybe it's the way I look. Or the sound of my name.
Rosen? I don't have a problem with that.
I don't feel anything.
Have to talk about something.
We have a few more minutes.
Do you know what "normal" is?
I suppose it's however society defines it.
How do you define it?
Fuck you, Rosen!
What did you want to happen?
I want you to calm down.
Nothing. Can I open my eyes?
I want you back in your chair! Right now!
I was six years old!
All right. A small house... with small rooms.
I feel... okay.
It's fucking freezing out here.
People without cars.
Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.
Yeah, they could.
Why do you want to know?
No you're not.
It's been a while since...
Since you've had sex?
Hi.
You don't really --
Bullshit.
What odds?
Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
Us seeing each other.
Neither am I.
Everyone needs a plant. This ivy is one tough baby. It's a cutting from one of mine.
What is that?  You drop your dive light?
Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?
Whose then?  Lindsey?  Talk to me...
Cute, Virgil.
What about O-2?
I can extend that.  There's some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module.  I'll have to go outside to tie onto them.
Deepcore, this is Cab One.  We need assistance, over.  Deepcore, this--
I don't know how!
I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?
It's gotta be, like, an emergency plan to keep it away from the Russians... Hotwire one of the nukes with some kinda detonator, put it back in the sub, and fry the whole thing, slicker'n snot. Oh, uh... hi, Lins.
Yeah.  The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands?
Got it. Over.
Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
Take the first watch in sonar.  Hippy, you handle the exterior surveillance.  One Night, see if you can get that transmitter working for me, okay?
Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly.
Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.  Well, hey... you guys know any songs?
How many are there?
Gimme a break!  Coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking Russian.
You're right... I don't.  I just need to know that this thing is out of here!  You hear me, Roger Ramjet?
Mrs. Brigman, you're becoming a serious impediment to this mission.  I believe the stress is affecting you.  Escort her to quarters and have Monk prepare a tranquilizer.
Let's go for it.  We could get lucky.
I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple hours on this.
Perry, stand by on the ROV.  Sorry about this, little buddy.  Better you than me, know what I mean?
It's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe.
What's the timer set for?
Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.
Through three miles of water?   I don't know.
But I think we should talk about it. Or are you fully convinced that we too won't understand each other?
There you go... Must you always spoil everything!
Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, I fell asleep.
But even here we were supposed to find who knows what... And all we bring back with us is a crate of cigarettes.
Sounds like the name of a fish -- merluzzo, basiluzzo...
There's no comparison.
What were you and Anna arguing about?... Excuse me for being so indiscreet, but this is serious...
I... I don't know... I didn't think it was worthwhile... She was laughing over it...
I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
Occasionally, but always with affection.
Yes. I had also thought of going there to talk with them...
But then when will we see each other?
I don't know why. I just couldn't help it.
I have no desire to sacrifice myself... It's idiotic to sacrifice oneself... Why?... For whom? If Anna were here I might understand your scruples. But she's not...
Are you joking?
What! Get married?
What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me?
Yes, yes, yes, yes... Right away...
Why?
I don't love you.
Better dead.
But why all nudes?
Me?... I no longer have any interest in building... And, then, where can you find boulders of rock like this in Milan?
I'll go even further and say that her presence here -- I don't want to sound offensive -- could be a great hindrance.
So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?
You men are all so dreadful!
So that's why you've turned to smuggling, eh? You need the money. Now, I can help you. I can see that you get some assistance from the government. But first there's a little formality we've got to take care of. Just a few questions and then we can all go to lunch... Your friend tells me you dropped anchor three times...
I ... I ... wasn't feeling well ... I.. I was sleeping... I don't know anything ... I ... I'm all mixed up and ...
Then it's impossible for her to know me. In the villa where I'm at, we have a male gardener.
So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
And what did they say about me?
Early? Is four in the morning early for you?
Good. Then I'll meet you there.
Oh, no, not at all. And then you know very well that he'll forgive you anything; just as long as you admit to him that you're a worse driver than he is...
If women's breasts were colored, yours would be blue...
Oh... I'm sorry I have to rush but I've got to write a story about this thing that just happened... Tell me exactly how it all turned out.
Who knows?... Another one has it that she entered a store in Troina. This information comes from the storekeeper himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought I don't know what in his store... at Troina.
Yes... of course... But you should also print that in your paper... But right away, tomorrow morning... It's the local Palermo paper, isn't it?... I mean, it's widely read...
I can't say.
I am, there's too much flesh on me.
... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
Agnes...
Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where...
Who?
Yes Mother.
Why?
Why?
They were stained.
Yes, Mother.
Yes.
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
Do you think he loves you?
Yes.
From their heads...
I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.
Then let's talk about something else...
Would you like to ask them?
Just that... you ask and I'll answer.
No.
Would you like to be?
Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?
From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know.
No... do you?
I don't know.
No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?
No.
Why not?  Mmm?
Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby.
I was a mistake.
And you're unhappy.
Only you think you're lucky because you didn't have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that maybe weren't always nice but that was because of me, because I was bad, not her.
Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me. I'll protect you from her.
And that you're stupid?
She says my whole body's a mistake.
What?
As much as God loves you.
To help me.
Because I was afraid.
Why?
It grew.
Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
No.
No... don't hit me please...
So I could go to him.
Who?
How did she know about him?
Yes.
Not your fault...
I hate him.
She took the baby in her arms?
And then... what did she do?  Agnes what did she do?
Sister...
Martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants this to come to trial, not the Church, not the Crown... least of all me.
You know Martha never comes to see me. You watch it, she's going straight to hell... after all the things she said to me. Then she marries that son of a bitch of a Frenchman... has an abortion. I knew that one wouldn't work out. Not like you Marie. You got married to God.
I remember when you was a little girl Marie. You come back from the movies and you'd say - Mama that ending was so sad... and I'd tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in Hollywood.  And you believed me.
Who are you?
Yes.
Uh huh.
Well you're probably right about that. It certainly can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time.
Do you still go to church?
... Thank you.
No-one.
Was there a priest?
Yes, but I...
Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here.
I am not with the Inquisition.
From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
I was appalled, just as you are now.
I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
I am...
Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was. I was needed in the sick room.
Listening to angels?
She drank too much. That's what killed her.
She molested her!
I'd like yours too.
The woman's health is at stake.
You just said...
That's all?  That's enough!  She was a beautiful little girl.
Even Christ would partake socially.
Saint Peter?
Then let's begin.
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
Why do you insist upon pressing...
The scandal...
You went to the room to help with the birth.
I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
You tied the cord around its neck.
Yes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddy's son of 'em. I saw their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. "Mister, can you spare us a copper?" he said. I was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler ... So, I took them under me managerial banner.
The usual ten per cent?
Eight and two thirds.
Shurrup!
I bet you're  -- sixteen!
All right, take your hoop and bowl.
I'm a deserter, too.
I see you go to the night court.
But your Grandfather lives in your house. I've seen him.
Now what's that supposed to mean?
He's sulking again.
Oh, I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake.
Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.
It's Paul's grandfather.
Eh, there's only three of them.
Something like that.
Oh aye, a sledge.
They ought to be.
I bet you don't sound like real people.
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
What of? Look, I wouldn't do it unless I was. I'm dead lucky 'cos I get paid for doing something I love doing.
And you honestly think that's what she meant?
Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?
That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!
Why do you always use your left hand?
Here, Pauly.
Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
Y'what?
He started it.
No ... he's must have slipped off somewhere.
No.
I would though.
Tonight? We can't make it ...
I'm not, no.
Aye, but you know him well.
What have you heard?
Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.
Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.
I knew it, <U>he</U> started it, I should have known.
Don't exaggerate.
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
Down the ... er ...
Clever.  George.
Shurrup, cheerful.
Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart.
Well ... if he's your Grandfather, who knows?
Yeah, It's all your fault, getting invites to gambling clubs. He's probably in the middle of an orgy by now.
I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.
I'm not kidding.  You can get one if you have the credit.  Look just like real cows, too.
No.  Just some horrible dreams about smothering.  Where are we?
Just short of Zeta II Reticuli.  We haven't even reached the outer rim yet.
Yeah.  Two hours.
Gravity?
Is it solid?
Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come topside for a minute?
All over the ship; we'll have to check the charts to know for sure.
It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm.  We were completely unprepared.
The water will still recycle.
Damn it!  How long to fix?
Right.
We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship.  That would kill it.
You just sealed it off; it can't get to that section.
But this thing uses it for <u>blood</u>.
Isn't there some way we can get it off him?
Careful, don't get under it!
The door was closed.  It must still be in here.
Does anybody know what happened?
No.
We can't spare the personnel.  We've got minimum takeoff capability right now.  That's why Chaz left us on board.
Why, you chickenshit bastard --
What is it -- I can't tell anything --
It doesn't make any sense.  It paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive.
All right.  Now just remember: keep away from those weapons unless I say otherwise.  Martin, do you read me?
My signal's fading.
But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact.
Is it still coming up, or is it hooked on something?
Can you see anything?
What is it?
Let's let the machine work on him.
Yes, thank heaven.
We've got about a week left, right?
That's the one about the albatross, right?
But why draw it on the wall?
But the idea's good, if we could just turn it around somehow.
And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
And you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and --
Kablooey.
No good... it's eaten too much of me...
Do you wanna head back and call it in?
God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.
Oh man...
A three-second burn to port, on my mark.
Drains right into the Central Reservoir.
Keep trying!
Shit.  When?
We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.
Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this.
Yeah?
It's moving slow.  About... eleven metres. On the left.
What's wrong?
How?
York just turned up outside.  We're trying to get him into Infirmary.
Where does that lead to?
Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
Compensate!
Looks like it.
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
Sure.  Do me good to stretch my legs.
Check out the tent.
Again?  How long before we start noticing the difference?
Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range.  They're making their own way back tomorrow.
Tactical nukes, maybe?
Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.
You should hit the sack, too.
You're more than kind. But it's still Miss Channing's performance. I'm just a carbon copy you read when you can't find the original...
Even so. One isolated pretty good performance by an understudy. It'll be forgotten tomorrow.
And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?
A fine old theater, the Shubert. Full of tradition, untouched by the earthquake - so sorry - fire... by the way, what was your husband's name?
Oddly enough - she didn't say a word about Margo. Just that she'll be happy to do what she can to see that I play the part.
Just like it.
What else?
I know nothing about Lloyd and his loves - I leave those to Louisa May Alcott. But I do know you.
I'm in love with Lloyd!
Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
Not with me, you're no champion. You're stepping way up in class.
Addison, will you please say what you have to say plainly and distinctly - and then get out so I can take my nap!
More plainly and more distinctly? I Have not come to New Haven to see the play, discuss your dreams, or to pull the ivy from the walls of Yale! I have come to tell you that you will not marry Lloyd - or anyone else - because I will not permit it.
Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.
I can't believe my ears...
Answer my question! Weren't you paid to get out of town?
No-no-no...
You can have one at Max's.
I don't want to make trouble. All I want is a drink.
You have me confused with Dan Dailey. You go sit by the piano.  And you come sit by me.  Good night.
As soon as the peasants stop pawing her.
Then you've heard too.
Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell?
It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...
You've heard of her great interest in the Theater-
Amen.
Didn't you know?
I take it she read well.
A mass of music and fire. That's me. An old kazoo and some sparkles. Tell me - was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice?
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-
Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant?
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
And cut that out right now.
Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
Then you're crazy.
She hasn't missed a week since I left - but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask - check with her.
Yeah... I will.
I love you too. Good night, darling-
That never stopped you before.
Then without feeling, your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be a shade more on the - shall we say, happier side?
Who?
I mix what I like.
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.
You've been all through that with Lloyd-
Tell that to Dr. Freud! Along with the rest of it...
It's time you found out. I love you.  I love you. You're a beautiful and intelligent woman-  - a beautiful and intelligent woman and a great actress-  - at the peak of her career. You have every reason for happiness-  - every reason, but due to some strange, uncontrollable, unconscious drive you permit the slightest action of a kid-  - kid like Eve to turn you into a hysterical, screaming harpy! Now once and for all, stop it!
You were great.
A foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady... that's for me. And no more make believe! Off stage or on... remember, Lloyd.  I mean it, now. Grown-up women only, I might even play a mother - only one child, of course, not over eight...  Lloyd, will you promise not to be angry with me?
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
It's only one picture deal.
You didn't have to tell me.
Of course not.
When you told me that whatever I became, it would be because of you-
I'm only human, rumors to the contrary. And I'm as curious as the next man...
I know. She just keeps hearin' her dead father play the banjo.
What did you expect - live sables?
Well. I guess a real tight girdle help when you're playin' a lunatic.
Something maybe grew a size bigger.
I couldn't get into the girdle in two an' a half hours...
She's got two things to do - carry clothes an' press 'em wrong - an' just let anybody else muscle in...
How do you mean that?
There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
Probably not.
Lots of actresses come from Brooklyn. Barbara Stanwyck, Susan Hayward - of course, they're just movie stars.
With changing and everything, a little over an hour.
Not at all.
I've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage I could raise-
Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.
Oh, no. I see the play.
Some Hollywood movie star, her plane got in late.
Karen...  ... isn't it awful, I'm about to ask you for another favor - after all you've already done.
The show must go on.
Nothing definite yet - it's just to have lunch.
Oh, but there is-
In a way. You find yourself trying to say what you mean, but somehow the words change - and they become his words - and suddenly you're not saying what you mean, but what he means-
But the raves about your performance-
You want to play "Cora." You want me to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.
That won't be necessary. Addison knows how Margo happen to miss that performance - how I happened to know she'd miss it in time to call him and notify every paper in town...  ... it's quite a story. Addison could make quite a thing of it - imagine how snide and vicious he could get and still write nothing but the truth. I had a time persuading him...  ... you'd better sit down. You look a bit wobbly.  If I play "Cora," Addison will never tell what happened - in or out of print. A simple exchange of favors. And I'm so happy I can do something for you - at long last...  Your friendship with Margo - your deep, close friendship - what would happen to it, do you think, if she knew the chap trick you'd played on her - for my benefit? And you and Lloyd - how long, even in the Theater, before people forgot what happened - and trusted you again?  No... it would be so much easier on everyone concerned, if I were to play "Cora." And so much better theater, too...
When he gets too close, I'll spit in his eye.
It's just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about-
Ain't it the truth?
She's just outside the door.
Harrington.
Of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet-
So many people - know me. I wish I did. I wish someone would tell be about me...
He's in love with you.
Not to you. Not to Bill.
About what?
Loud.
- don't run out of adjectives, dear.
Well. We've spent weekends before with nobody talking...  ... just be sure to lock up all blunt instruments and throwable objects...
I just don't want Margo to miss her train. As it is, she'll barely make the theater...
On her knees, I have no doubt! Very touching, very Academy-of-Dramatic Arts!
Old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy! And a phobia against truth!
Where is she?
Shucks. And my autograph book is at the cleaners.
I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays...
Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea...
The audience will want its money refunded, believe me.
Lloyd, I want you to be big about this... the world is full of love tonight, no woman is safe...
She is a louse.
I mean really, deeply angry...
I just played it.
An audition for the part we're replacing. What's-her-name, your sister...
Would you?
Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would-
Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
Think of your health, Max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track...
That's my Max.
Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?
I didn't hear you.
I said I'm a dying man!
--you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
--they're all the same, all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart--
--mine's better--
--see?--
It's not us, they were scared before we got there.  What do we know?
And that something's got to be more than just Hunt, Liddy, and the five burglars--those indictments are gonna be bullshit when they come down. What else do we know?
'68.
You want me to be the bastard.
--we gotta top the Times--
--if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again--
Then he's got an ax.  Call him anyway.
--I haven't said anything--
--Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach--
Who?
What was the mistake? Do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means?
--jeeeeeeesus--
The telephone calls... we know about that.
I'm so glad.
Good. Just tell him I was here, that I'm sorry I missed him--
Can't help you.
Give me your checkbook then.
Just let me get a match.
There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
Gordon Liddy, you mean?
Think Sloan's being set up as a fall guy for John Mitchell? Sometimes it looks that way.
I will not talk about the other two.
And we'll all have to go to work for a living.
Probably you're right, but a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars.
So?
She's an awfully good reporter--I can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you?
Go on.
This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what.
--melodramatic?  Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City.
Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it.
Talk about Segretti--
How grand?
Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti.
Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
Where in government?
Two o'clock, work the phones 'til you go.
That's everything Bachinski had, I think it's worth following up.
Let me see what you get, but don't jump--The New York Times thinks it's crazy Cubans.
Anyone but Bernstein.
--can we use their names?--
As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.
No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
When so ordered.
The what to what?
Like what?
Nah.  Fuck, you guys are right, I don't know what I'm doing.  I mean I'm acting like I've got it all together tonight.  But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her.  And I don't know what I'm gonna say.  So now it's like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the whole thing.
Come on!  I won't tell.
I'm glad you think so.
No.  I'm missing the game for you.
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
Of course he does.  What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
What?
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
But that one time --
Do you love her?
Are you kidding?  No.
Yeah, I'm the best, baby.
I do, baby, I do.
You think she was serious?
No, "Charming" is old.  "Older" is <u>really</u> old.  "Youthful mind" is dead.
Oz, how about you and Heather?  Now you guys are a couple or something?
I'm not going.
You're not...busy?
Dad, come in.
These are for you.  From father to son.
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Yes.
I know.  Hey Nadia.
Dad!!
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
It reminds me of this one time --  Hey, can I ask you a question?  How come you don't have any stories?  I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any.
A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
So do I, Kev.
Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
Yes, slowly.
Oh no.
Oh yes.  Very arousing women.  They arouse me very much.  But not as arousing as you.
You think so?
Kevin, this is serious!
Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
I think you're so right, Kevin.
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
That's good, that's what I needed to hear.  Now you qualify.
I'm such a loser.
Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm working on something new.
Yeah right.  I got an idea for something new.  How 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em.
Bullshit.  From where?
Dude, watch me work.  They go for sensitive studs like me.
Doing what?
No way.
Oh give me a break! He could use pills back in America! Why not get a little culture?
Also like sex with my wife.
What a coincidence, I am someone!  Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too.
You? You're Madame Flocquet? I pictured a fat lady with an apron, not - I don't know - La Femme Nikita.
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
Yeah... Ditto. I saw, er, I thought I saw you get munched... like Uncle Terrence...
Hey, what more could I want? I survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride, and neither of us is dead. I'd say I feel almost as great as you look.
I know! Let's go hock loogies off the Eiffel Tower!
Okay. But I'm back in half an hour.
Are you okay?
A cure?
I... I didn't think you would... I'm sorry... I believed that son-of-a- bitch...
What...?
Really.
What?
Andy...
My uncle's in a coma you moron!
He didn't tell me anything. All he said was Saint Severin...
Yeah, okay. Just gimme a minute to freshen up.
If you know about the church, why ask such stupid questions?
Hey, I'm new here, what do you want?
What about me?
The cops. It's their backward laws that force all this underground in the first place, endangering people whose only crime is pushing the limits of perception, exploring new states of psychic awareness.
You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
Yeah, well if I claw my face off, just pack it in ice, okay? Jesus... the cops were probably right. My uncle was messed up with a bunch of fry brains and they went berserk on him.
It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.
You sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much?
Yeah. Look, uncle Terrence -
Claude.
Your uncle was carrying this. The keys to his apartment are in there. I talked to his assistant, Madame Flocquet. You'll be staying there a while?
Double merde.
It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . .
But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
Yes, your highness.
You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
I have my reasons.
Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
No, he just wanted to know you were happy.
She leads a charmed life, that little one ... Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him.
Pray he's color-blind...
Are you feeling all right?
She does.
Perhaps you could convince her?
What's your name?
You don't want my autograph.
What?
This guy, on the Johnny Carson show.
I took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a meeting with Charlie. You take a meeting with him.
Alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life.
Who are you?
Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
Why not?
Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.
I prefer not to, because... look, they're laughing at him. See, so what are yuh telling me-
Do you feel all right?
Portchnik.
Well, why not?
Tsch.
Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
Get him!
Talk to him. You speak shellfish!  Hey, look... put it in the pot.
Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.
Oh, yeah? So do you. Oh, God, whatta-  whatta dumb thing to say, right? I mean, you say it, "You play well," and right away... I have to say well. Oh, oh... God, Annie.  Well... oh, well... la-de-da, la-de- da, la-la.
Well, where is it? I-
I'll getcha a piece.
Oh, right.
I'll see yuh.
No, I got time.
Fifteen years?
Oh, yeah.
Uh, I hate to tell yuh, this is nineteen seventy-five, you know that "neat" went out, I would say, at the turn of the century.  Who-who are-who are those photos on the wall?
Oh... oh, well, you see now now, uh, that's my dad, that's Father-and that's my... brother, Duane.
Narcolepsy, right, right. Right. So, anyway, so...  George, uh, went to the union, see, to get his free turkey, be-because, uh, the union always gave George this big turkey at Christmas time because he was...  shell-shocked, you know what I mean, in the First World War.  Anyway, so, so...  George is standing in line, oh, just a sec... uh, getting his free turkey, but the thing is, he falls asleep and he never wakes up. So, so...  so, he's dead ...  he's dead. Yeah. Oh, dear. Well, terrible, huh, wouldn't you say? I mean, that's pretty unfortunate.
Me? No, no, no, 'cause I never shower in a public place.
Fifteen years, huh?
Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?
Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club. I don't-
No, I'm gonna quit!
No.  You're a wreck.
big subject with me, yeah.
M'hm.
And blind people, crippled...
M'hm.
M'hm.
Oh! Italian, right?
You are extremely sexy.
I love you.  You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.
You don't want me to live with you?
I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh? 
Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.  M'mrnm.
U-huh.
Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass  because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-
Yeah.
Well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.
Oh, stop it. But you were having an affair with your college professor. That jerk that teaches that incredible crap course "Contemporary Crisis in Western Man"!
"Neat"! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."
Well, listen, that's, a nice bi-it's a biblical name. Right? W-What does he call you? Bathsheba?
M'm.
Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.
M'hm.
Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
Yeah.
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
Well, well, sure... because he's a singer and you're a singer, you know, so it's perfect. So you're trying to suffocate yourself. It-it makes perfect sense. Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic... kind of insight.
Oooh.
Yeah.
I think I left it there, I'm sorry.
Oh, uh, I don't know. I miss you. Tsch.
Oh, I had the radio on.
Tsch, why don't we get... why don't we get Rob, and the three of us'll drive into Brooklyn, you know, and we show you the old neighborhood.
Okay, okay. Okay.
Hey, can yuh watch the road? Watch the --
What... huh?
What thing?
I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.
And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
Sometimes I think-sometimes I think I should just live with a woman.
No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.
Well... H-h huh... Oh, good... Yes, I'll tell him.
I'm nauseous.  Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the TV show?
Yeah.
There's no-no question in my mind. I think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt.
Remember that day?
You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.
Oh, Alvy, come on.
Air miles, you know. I mean, you know what that does to my stomach?
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
Can I confess something?
You should be ashamed of yourself.
"Why-why do you always r-reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories?  he said as he removed her brassiere..."
Tsch, a few.
Well, that's funny, because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here. So... so, here, just let me- I mean, all right. Come over here... a second.
Yes, I remember.  He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
There's no economic crime, you know, but there's-there's ritual, religious- cult murders, you know, there's wheat- germ killers out here.
What difference does that make?
V.P.L.?
Hi. How do you do.
Oh, I did Shakespeare in the Park, Max. I got mugged. I was playing Richard the Second and two guys with leather jackets stole my leotard.
Keeps out the alpha rays, Max. You don't get old.
His wife has diabetes!
Di-diabetes? Is that any excuse? Diabetes?
She was going through my pocketbook!
Who's persecuting? She stole!
Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
No, no, no, not at all.
...of possibly working together.
Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
Why didn't you come in?
It has your ring.
Why last?
And how's the diva doing?
Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay?
I don't know what's going on.  I don't care to guess.  Mac's really unhappy. She isn't there, that's all.  She's no idea what she's playing, not a clue.
Leo?
I have a small window of time.
Oh.
You know Sophia.  She's so damned judgemental.  And she's so damned... perfect.  And so fucking... serene.  Just fucking don't tell her.  Because you know Mac thinks she's God.  And I can feel him comparing.
Yeah.
Damn straight.
It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
You have?
Forget it, Judy.
Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you?
Not as a rule.
Are you always this much fun?
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
There's still time to undo this.
Scout's honor.
What?
Really?
And Joe's huge in Europe.  He's like a rock star in London.  His novels sell millions.
Truce?
I'm worried about my spine.  I'm very worried about my brain and my spine.
Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you.  I haven't lied to you.  I told you about the people I've slept with.  I just didn't mention the few occasions I took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me.  Sally, we're back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please let's not do this.
Right.  And when was the last time you spoke to her?
Who the fuck do you think you are?  The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life.  Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally.
Sally, for Christ's sake.
Life gets messy.  Ugly messy.  But I don't understand you.  And I don't think I ever understood Lucy.  I don't understand throwing it away.  How do you throw all that away?  Any of it.  I want it all.  You guys want guarantees?  I want the possibilities.  And all kinds of crap comes with that.  A lot of bad shit. And I think that's okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff.  All the good shit.  All the surprises.  It's a fucking miracle when you come down to it.  We'd have had amazing children, you and me.  We'd have had a ride.  You'd have surprised yourself.  I'll never love anybody else, you know.
Oh, Sally Mae...
Sure.
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find?
Ah.
I meant Sally.
Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.  I see you've moved up from the soft stuff.
Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction.
Here, drink this.  Drink lots of water.  Hold on to this.  Take deep breaths. Nice and slow.  Would you like a lolly?
You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one.
They're nothing like us.
You're not serious.
Why?
Let's just go home, okay?
Are you working on a new book?
Yes.
I so wish I'd known.
There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
How long ago was it?
Oh?
I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know.
Do Peter Sellers again.
Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!
Who told you that?  No.  I'm twenty...  Five.
It could be worse.
How?
I wasn't finished.
"We can't stand seeing you like this, Panes.  I hate you being alone.  Why don't you stay with us for a while?" "I'd love to, thanks."
You're a shit.
From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle...
Ah.
So where should I put it?
The both of you.
Hey, let's sit down.  I bet the rug feels really nice against your skin.
Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.
Are you asking me out to dinner?
That's right!  He slaughtered hundreds of termites single-handedly!
Right...because every ant's important!
It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.
Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now.
There's something going on, Z --
A <u>few</u>?
Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises.
It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?
I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
Superior numbers, kid!
Barbatus?
No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.
Princess!  You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?
Desperate times call for desperate measures.  Get me Ant Team Six.
Ant Team Six...
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
I...I have no idea, sir.
ARREST HIM!
Terrific!  You <u>should</u> feel insignificant!
Why are we so successful?
Right!  Ants!  Millions of creatures, each with his assigned task, all pulling together!
And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.
Well, you just sit here and be a party-pooper.
You're a real buddy.
I seem to have dropped my key.  Oh -- here it is.
Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
What did I tell you?
Sheldrake?
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
Good night.
You mean tonight?
What time does the show go on?
Eight-thirty!
What gave you that idea?
Three.
I thought so.
He and I are like this.  Sent me a Christmas card. See?
The mirror -- it's broken.
I'm so tired -- DR. DREYFUSS Here -- drink this.
I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --
My head -- it feels like a big wad of chewing gum. What time is it?
Two o'clock.
Sure I do. It's always nice to have company for Christmas.
And where are you now?
Why do people have to love people, anyway?
I don't want it.
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
Was he really upset when you told him?
Mr. Sheldrake? Oh, yes. Very.
I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
I was washing my stockings, so I decided I might as well do your socks.
Yes, you are,  When I was straightening up the couch, you know what I found? Six hairpins, a lipstick, a pair of false eyelashes, and a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.
I wouldn't say that --  What would you like to have for diner? There's onion soup and canned asparagus --
Of course not. Here's the fruit cake.  And you want to see my knee? 
It's a must -- gracious-living-wise.
Oh.
I never thought he'd do it.
I told you all along. You see, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
Yes.  You walking to the subway?
That's funny -- so am I.  What did you do with the cards?
Seven --  -- queen.
Shut up and deal!
So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle? What was going on here last night?
What for?
I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.
You do?
Sir?
No, sir. I'm not going to deny it. But if you'd just let me explain --
How would you like to go tonight?
Now put down the key --  -- and put down the address.
Relax, Baxter.
No, you don't understand. She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
Oh, yes. Thanks.
Now what was your news, Baxter?
Don't mind what?
You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.
I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.
I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it.
Yes, Mr. Kirkeby.  You still owe me for the last two bottles --
A lot of guys around here have tried it -- all kinds of approaches -- no dice.  What is she trying to prove?
No!
Say, Baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.
Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!
Get that stuff out of her stomach -- if it isn't too late. You better put some coffee on -- and pray.
Sure, Doc.
Happy New Year.
That so.
Well, you can't win 'em all.
No.
Might as well go to mine -- everybody else does.
Ask anybody around here. As a matter of fact, when it's time for me to go -- and I may go just like that --  -- I have promised my body to the Columbia Medical Center.
Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it.
What gripes me is the two of them were guzzling my champagne while Sylvia and I wound up at the Guggenheim Museum.
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
Why did you take sleeping pills?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Let me take that.
I don't believe you.
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
If you'll just listen to me for a minute --
Let's get something straight, Jeff -- I never asked you to leave your wife.
Are you sure that's what you want?
You know I do.
Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.
And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --
What are you talking about?
I'd spell it out for you -- only I can't spell.
You mean you bring other girls up here?
Well --
Yeah.
A sauciere --
... he's an amazing officer.
Said I speak French like a Spanish cow.
No shit -- hot damn --
Can't be any worse than this. What do you think?
Get in there now or I'll bury you in this river.
Signs?
Touchy.
You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.
Nobody comes in here.
No, it'd be spooky without the war -- give 'em back.
I believe on your last job you executed a tax collector in Kontum, is that right ?
A man of war is never bothered to aid an ally -- you will follow me, Captain.
Thank you, sir.
What, sir?
I said it's a good swell -- hell of a good swell 'bout six feet. Let's get a look at it.
Napalm, boy -- nothing else in the world smells like that --
What?
Haven't got time, Hell's Angels -- lay it right up the tree line.
What'd you do for supplies?
Can you trust them?
How's yours?
Because of all the things we do, the thing we do best -- is lie.
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
I'm taking you back.
You were his friend... You must have been, if he had given you this...  If he sent you to his home. He was the best this country had -- he was --
Both of us...
Yes I was... He said his last words to me.
He can't kill us.  We're on his side.
Yeah, Jesus Christ !
You think?
Why did they attack us?
No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be crazy -- if you heard him talk, just last week, you'd never think he was crazy.
The war will still be here tomorrow.
No. Not really.
Yes.
Well, you know I don't have the priority to do that, sir. It says here not to contact Com-Sec- Int. Who's your commanding officer ?
Beverly Hills --
150  CONTINUED:
26   CONTINUED:  
Back against the bars.  Now.
Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
Fairbanks is a three-hour flight. I'll be back by dinnertime.
I'm staying.
My home is here.  With you.
Relax.  I just want to ask them how the hunting is.
Six months.  Ecological study for Northland Oil.
Hunting and trapping was a damn fine life.  Me and Mitchell, Bob and LeMalle, we were teams.  I'd always go with Mitchell.  Good man, Mitchell.  I'd let Bob worry about goddamn LeMalle.  We'd hire a plane in October.  On the way to a dirt airstrip somewhere, we'd drop supplies.  We'd land, tell the pilot to come back for us a few days before Christmas.
You got the belly to look me in the eye and pull the trigger?
With light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.
I don't plan on dying.
-- Turn around.
Yep.  Sometimes they do, but usually they end up crazy or dead.
What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
You don't feel cold?
It was blown up with the plane.
An appetite.  Maybe you won't die after all.
Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here.
All you do is keep folks from working the land, living like they're meant to.  You don't understand shit!  Trappers, hunters -- we're part of the environment.  Who's protecting us?  I've seen plenty like you.  So -more-
We'll get you to a hospital, soon as we get to Fairbanks.
Sam, give Dixie here fifty bucks out of my kit, will you?
What's the problem with Sam Wilder's place?
Will you rent me a cabin, or not?
-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --
-- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
-- We appreciate the company. Anne Marie's getting cabin fever already.
Any idea who could've done it?
I just as soon he stay gone. Fool could've got us all killed, arresting Ben Corbett here in town.
Corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...
Cool out.  I ain't about to get blasted.
So shoot him.  Won't have to feed him that way --
I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little...  You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.
Spencer's doing fine. So what are you saying, that you're frustr...
Leave me be! Why are you doing this? Why are you picking at my sores... What is it that you want?... You want what? What's with you? I hope getting me thinking of everything that's wrong when all I want is to not do this has some purpose.  What is it, Mom? No kidding.
I love you.
Emergency room only.
Just give yourself a little pep talk. "Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out."
His name?
Why did yo do this for me?
To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up.
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
I can't. I work.
Melvin, I'd rather not.
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
Are you still coming?
Nonsense!
You like sad stories -- you want mine.
Dancing?
One baked -- one fries.
Tell me even if you're scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. It's okay.
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
It's your car but I don't want to hear it. If that means anything.
I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number.
What a break...
Melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you don't know me all that well...  I'm not the answer for you.
No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.
I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
Uh-huh...
No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer than you think. I give the wrong impression sometimes and...
No. No. Get Carol.
Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
So am I, Frank.
Hi. You have hard shells, right?
I haven't looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction.
Frank's idea. He thought I should have notes so I did this right... maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you.
Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
It smells like shit in here?
Go away.
Rot in hell, Melvin.
Stupid dog.  I don't get it.
Thanks.
Got any easier questions?
Melvin...
I give you that one...  Nice packing.
... so Mom. Truly no grudges -- truly. A little odd that you didn't come to see me when you heard I was hurt, but the important thing I want you to know is your son is happy. I'm working again. I'll make do -- I don't want a thing. Wouldn't take it if it was offered. I'll drop you a note from wherever I land and then it's up to you. I hope we patch things up but know that if we don't, I wish you both the very best... I can't hear you. You heard me, though, right? Good -- take good care. 'Bye.
Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story... I think you've got a chance. The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard.
I forgot to lock the door.
No...  Okay. What I do is watch and wait for, um... You ever watch someone who doesn't know you're watching...  an old woman on a bus, kids going to school and you see this flash come over them and you know immediately that it has nothing to do with anything external -- that it's in respond to a private thought they just had? They are just sort of realer and more alive. And when you notice it so are you. If you look at someone long enough, you discover their humanity.
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
Probably.
Just do your job.
Holy shit!  Robert Rath wants to know my name.
What I just said, no assassin would say.  What I've said, only a mark would say.
Now I'll tell you something.  It wouldn't fucking matter if I offered you one hundred million dollars. You'd still be thinking the same thing, that you're going to take me. And here I am, sitting through this, knowing it's bullshit, looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind, the only thing I can think is that, in just a few minutes I'm going to take you.
Yes, sir.
Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso.
Paid in full.
$1,000,000.
You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
Now you understand why I'm here.
You didn't know anything about me.
What does that mean?
No.  They hired Bain.  The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one.
He wants to kill you?
Why?
The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.
He will know everything about you. Everything.  I know, because I've done it.  Once you've been inside a mark's home, you're in their head. If you're any good, you'll find the mark in a week, and Bain is good because I was the best and I couldn't take him.
Yeah.
Better than playing with yourself.
You were like a boy genius?
I was just different.
They didn't give you a choice, did they?
Women?  No... not really.
They tried to kill you?
Then you went freelance?
No.  Something honest.
You said you didn't trust it.
Why not?
What happens if you do?
I don't know... But I'm sure he's not sleeping.
Really?
Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
Except --
What?
For Nicholai?
Yes.
Ten years ago.
No.
Isn't it interesting though?  I mean, look at us, in this room.  Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  I mean, we look like just another couple.  But what are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?
I don't know.  When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.
Yes.
Why?  I don't know.
She was taken.
Honestly?
What?
But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?
Shit... oh well.
Taken.
You mean quit?
Yeah.
How would you like the funds?
Yeah right!....I don't know, something isn't right with this place, it's all too sterile and staged. Do you ever wonder why there's no Czechs here?
You're outnumbered Kat two to one, got to go with the majority, that's democracy.
That's Lubosh, the greatest fiddle player in Prague. You must have seen him playing with Johnny on the bridge. ......Come on, let's grab a table.
An alternative literary venue!
So? DOUG Well, there's tons of empty buildings - why don't we get one?
We could make a run for it?
Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
You got my word on it.
Don't worry, I'll give you a hand as soon as I can.
Sure....As for the crap, I've got an idea.
A locksmith too? Why d'you ever bother with writing?
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
I don't know Doug, we haven't even got the place together and already you want to extend it.
You'd be better off with tables and chairs.
What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
It looks new, they might miss one or two.
Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
Well, I think I_ve got a handle on the Czech pysche and I reckon this kind of joint will make _em reminisce about the sixties. Plus we should get a few stray expat_s looking for Kafka.
No, it could take me hours. You know what it's like trying to find things in this town, not to mention disposable stuff - I wouldn't think they've ever heard of them.
I can't, I've got to split. I have to take a class at two o'clock.
What are you on about?
What?
The performance is free what more do you want....I've set that old phone up as a donation box and I'll get Jahn to write out a sign....Okay, let's get going.
So?
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
Yeah, Dave Walters.
Yeah....Shit, those guys have guns.
Here's the details.
I could pencil you in if you like?
What?
What? You are crazy!
We should go to the Metro it's quicker.
It's bad news when you can't even bribe kids.
No.
There's nothing there for me.
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
Sure, they are students.
It's not so much.
Yeah, it's a simple piece. If they get the floor done in time, me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon, but it's not critical.
You can hold back this months pay-check until I come through with the story.
Uh-huh!
Run into Josh?
You will wish you hadn't.
Either you're a liar or you are a fool.
No!
The choice is yours, it's not negotiable.
Release Mr Greenwell's possessions.
Nothing. I've got to put up some kitchen shelves that's all. You've got one haven't you?
Yeah.
Come on, that shit can wait.
What for?
You are quite sure it's secure?
That was not my decision, I can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored. In the meantime no one else must know those files exist. Secure the building and I will arrange alternative safe storage immediately.
All the more reason to eliminate him.
With you.
I'll tell her you were here.
I'm sorry about how we --
About a job.
It could help with a new car --
Yeah.
I didn't know either.
I'm just wondering --
You.
-- I wear the sweater because I'm cold. I read because no one talks to me. My hair is my hair. What is it exactly that's bothering you?
I don't want to have any conversation.
-- I know you don't suck at acting.
Do you think I'm strange?
Could be...
Or building blocks for a world that never formed.
In 76 years, me neither.
Wonder. Beauty. Joy.  Love.
Loved?
Where?
Me.
I don't care.
I'm sick.
I don't want you to see him outside school activities.
I thought we had rid ourselves of his disagreeable companionship.
Jamie, you're not mad at me. You're mad at Landon --
That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you.
So talk to us about something.
Okay. Sure.  My grandfather. When he was seven, he shook the hand of an old guy, a war vet or something, who had once shaken President Lincoln's hand.  Made a big impression on him.
Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress.
I'm not tired.
Or something. They're doing a play for the holidays.
You don't. That's the point.
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
Are you?
What do you want, Biff?
And you never heard of rock 'n roll?
No....
I don't know. National Cash Register?
I was practicing. I've got an audition next week -- I gotta practice. How am I gonna get famous if I don't practice?
Seventeen.
Uh, thanks...
Poly-what?
Marty, you haven't been listening. Nobody's asked me to the dance...yet.
Listen,  Professor Brown told me you called last night and gave me your message...
How are you?
Saturday night's the 'Springtime in Paris' dance. I'm taking Suzy Parker.
Lemme see that.
I'm going to be at the dance.
Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear?
Five cents, please.
Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.
Is Shemp all right?
A mall?
We don't....
But that's impossible!! George asked her out! He had to! I saw him walk her home! Oh, God!
Professor -- there are some doors that shouldn't be opened, Marty said softly, without turning around.
No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him.
No way!
Hell no! The way my mom carries on about sex -- you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest. You shoulda seen her face when I told her we were gonna stay up all night Saturday, he added. Always afraid something is going to happen.
Oh yeah?
Can't afford to take chances.
Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.
They come with the house.
Okay.
You lost that one?
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
I can't think of anything at the moment... I'd like you to write me out a slip, though, proving I came down here.
You like people?
What'd you come out here for?
She'd get along okay. And if she didn't, well, she could take off, just take off, I wouldn't mind... I'd always tell people I deserved it.
No.
I don't know.
Okay.
Don't ask me.
What?
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
Put that down. It's dirty.
He didn't say anything to me about it.
Just to keep him out of the sun.
Yeah.
We're going to have to sit down, and talk about that sometime.
This your place?
Stay as long as you like.
Just thinking.
Okay, no monkey business then.
No.
New Jersey?
It's an antidote. A formula.  Whoever it was on the phone made me scribble this and gave me the ability to penetrate their disguises.
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
He went on a senseless crime spree, killed a cop during a bank robbery, got caught and judged insane.  The professor told us they threw away the key.
Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems?  You think they're mixed up in this?
Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
Stole his body?  When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind snapped?  Of course!  What else?
Pretty terrible shot.
It's kinda hard this way.
Any time.
She was killed, Penny.
How did she die?  I wanna know.
Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character.
Believe in Penny Priddy?
Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
Asshole probably got lost.
He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.
What. What don't I understand?
Audrey, thank you for coming. Thank you.  I'm sorry to be such a... such a... Thank you.
Oh, he's... he drifted off. He'll sleep for a while now. What is it you have to do, exactly?
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
Chet!
I  I've got respect for  for working guys, like you 
It's still a little early for me.
No son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out. No, I'm usin' it to build somethin'.
Are you all right?
I said drown 'em all! Who is that?
I need help, Audrey.
But... I thought no one cared about this picture.
Well he's taken an interest!  That means he'll make your life hell, which I could care less about, but since I drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going  don't worry, I covered for you. Told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. I told him it was great, so now MY ass is on the line.  He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.
I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.
Yes... Isn't it?
That's all right, really, thank you.
Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York  hopefully our numbers are growing  who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths  not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...
I can feel my butt getting sore already.
Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying  a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!
Well, we've got something in common then.
No, I guess you're stuck with the one you've got. Have a seat.
Not at all. It's damned interesting.
Seems like nothing but, lately.
In a few days. Out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact  New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office.
Well...
What do you mean?
Have to, old timer. Just for a while.
I hear it's Mundt. Madman Mundt.
Thanks, but I wanted a place that was less...
...Yes, thank you.
Actually it hasn't officially gone through yet. Had wardrobe whip this up. You gotta pull teeth to get anything done in this town. I can understand a little red tape in peacetime, but now it's all-out warfare against the Japs. Little yellow bastards.  They'd love to see me sit this one out.
I'm checking in. Barton Fink.
That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you.
Funny. As in, he likes to ventilate people with a shotgun and then cut their heads off.
You're a sick fuck, Fink.
Would that be good enough for ya?
He's a little funny in the head.
I dunno, Duke. I kinda liked it.
A couple days ago.
What are you gonna do -- charge me with smoking?
Did you find out about her parents?
How about the coke?
Who?
Who's got access to my goddamn file?
Yes you did.  I'm a big girl.  I can handle it.
I don't need any help.
She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
I don't smoke.
I quit.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong woman.
That's right.
They were drug buys.  I was a vice cop.
Only in theory.  You know all about homicidal impulse, don't you, shooter?  Not in theory -- in practice.
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
There's Pepsi in the fridge.
No.  I wrote it years afterwards.
No.
Good.  I'd miss you.  You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.
I'll risk it.
Do you want her to join us sometime?
Fine.  How's your back?
No.
Everybody that I care about dies.
No, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited.  I don't have luck with women. There was this girl I met while I was in college.  I slept with her once.  She started following me around, taking my picture.  She dyed her hair, copied my clothes. Lisa something... Oberman.  It was awful.
When?
I would've paid more.  I wanted to know everything about you.  Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.
Did you?  What's she doing?
I'm writing a book.
Somebody always does.
How's that?
Cocaine.
What was the weapon?
Thanks.
I hope I helped you out.
Not now he don't.
What is it you got between you?
I don't son, but I got the minority opinion.
In that little pissant car of yours? Hell, no.  I ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- I'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate Seiko watch.
How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
Maybe she did, Gus.  Maybe she grew herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face.  Let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.
I said keep it.
We bring her in for questioning.
And you volunteered.
What about me?
It was an accident.
I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
It's yours.
Did you check all four years?
When's your show?
Why, so you could humiliate me?
Let's get out of here.
Yeah... Like  stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these.
Well, have you asked her to come back?
You should talk to him about this.
I really think you should talk to him about this.
Bring him over sometime. I have some other stuff to show him.
Yes. What do they... stand for?
Hmmm. And 'Parasites.'  You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.
Well, you said that.  You've got a lot of references from Leonardo da Vinci, don't you?
Yes, but as a black painter 
Who said that?
Out?
Yeah..
Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing?
Yeah man. I'm jealous. You're always great, Benny.  "Her name is G-I-N-A Gina And she lo-oooves me." I did say chicken!
Concentrate on the ball. Shoot.
He drops dead! See? Just do your shit like you do it! Your friends like you, you get laid, everyone walks by, sees your stuff everywhere. It's good. What else do you want?
He's the best painter in the world. I'm gonna give him one of these.
Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?
Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee 
Don't you think he's using you?
Why does everybody say that? He's the only person I know who doesn't need to use me.
What's his name?
No, I'd like the scarf.
No name? That's ok. I'll just call you Big Pink.
What is it you want? Respect? I have respect for you, just for making this call. One philosopher said "Sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." Think about it. Feel it.
Jean Michel Basquiat.
5:11.
I need this?
Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
I'm here for an interrogation. You've been called a graffiti artist and I wanna know why. All I see are scribble scrabble abstractions!
You're selling and ending the culture. Not one bit of information. Only to get the money and growl with the power, man.
It's vichyssoise, sir.
No, actually I feel worse.
"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
I think I'll take the stairs.
Ah.  "Who", may I ask, are you going "as"?
Right.  Sure.  And "Peace on earth, good will toward men."
Hanging on every word.
We do.
Don't be naive.  The law doesn't apply to people like him!  Or us --
Wrong on both counts.
Things change.  Hey, good to meet you.  We'll be working hand in glove in Gotham's glorious future.
Things change.
Have we?
No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
And it's not even accurate ... I mean, "Batman Blows It"?  The guy probably prevented <u>millions</u> in property damage.
I heard on TV, "Catwoman is thought to weigh 140 pounds."  How do these hacks <u>sleep</u> at night?
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
No darker than yours, Bruce.
Nope, I told her everything.
Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
"Vicki."  Ice-skater, or stewardess?
No hard feelings?
Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
The name is Oswald Cobblepot.
My lips are sealed.
You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.
Yes, adulation is a cross to bear. God knows <u>I</u> know.  But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic!
And a very, very good one.
Too good?
Actually, it's a lot like that.
It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.
Despite all your talents, you are still a novice in the ways of family. Dick follows the same ends as you but gets there by his own course.  You must learn to trust him.  For that is the nature of family.
Attending to heroes?  No sir.  My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.  Personally.  Me.  I did.
I'm so sorry to trouble you, but-
Of course, Dick Grayson, ward of the fabulously wealthy Bruce Wayne. Why would you need a few hundred dollars?
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
Divide and conquer.
This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?
The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
Me too.  Great stems, though.
Open Sesame...Chicken.
Can he save her?
I have here a proposal showing how Wayne Enterprises can immediately cease all actions that toxify our environment.
Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat.  No coolants to preserve food.  Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
Can I get some help over here?
I'm betting on you.  You'll make someone a good husband one day. But I can't wait around forever. Don't answer now.  Just think it over.  Here's some food for thought.
Anybody want to tell us kids in the cheap seats who Joanna Clark is?
But he's never said a word-
I'm scared, Dick.  Maybe for the first time in my life.  I'm really scared.
Fine.  While I retrieve my diamonds, you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair.  She's frozen in -
The way to a boy's heart is through his ego.  What strapping young hero could resist his very own...signal?
Inspired, Ms. Ivy.
To be frozen.  To never change.  A life of perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.
Love you?  I loathe your bipedal arrogance, your animal superiority. My only joy is knowing that even now my poison kiss is sucking the life from your ape-like face.
Which `they' might that be, sir?
Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...
Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
...Afraid.
...A bat.
No demons, son.  Your monsters are here. Until you fact that, I fear you will spend your life fleeing them.
...Batman, Alfred. I'm Batman.
Enigma.
I didn't know that. See? You _are_ interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name? Or do I just call you bats?
Excellent. See. Who says a guy in a rubber suit can't be smart? Well, it's been grand. Sorry you all have to die now.
Exactly!
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
Rinka.
Somebody's been sending me love letters. Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion.
Just ones this beautiful.
She's a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams.  Need one?
Me? No. Only things that need calming in my dreams are the Rockettes.
Wacko? That a technical term?
What do you know about obsession?
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
Excuse me.
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
I'm not-
Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?
You do know. Try.
But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us.
Fred?
Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
So not everyone can be a poet. Still, I respect the sentiment.
Haven't you had enough? Don't Think And Drive.
A miss. And my favorite vitamin, I might add.
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
I know. I called them.
Too many people. Come on!  SHIELDS!!
I just wanted to distract them. I wasn't trying to get a picture of you.
Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
How do I know you won't keep them all?
It doesn't protect your head, though.
I loathe bats.
You could've killed him, you know. You could've killed the Joker.
Bruce Wayne.  -- I've read your work.  I quite like it.
Great.  Give me a grant.
That's a tough one.  Have you ever seen combat?
... Terror.
I said I'd call you the minute I got free.  And I did -- And here we are.
Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.
That ain't what I heard.  That ain't what I heard at all.  I heard the bat got him.
No wonder you're such a chickenshit.  Now shut up.  There ain't no bat.
Is that what you "heard"?
Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
That's it.
Huh. Demands. Well, gents, this is kinda embarrassing, but... I'm having such a swell time, I just haven't thought any up.
Goddammit, I expect to be treated like and ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!
What?  I improved her a little...
Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
Why?  Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious.  I do this for a living.  There's a phone.  You can call him up and cancel.
Are they paying you for all this?
He's not crazy.
You okay?
Yeeees?
Ahm - he's male.  He's English.  He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.
Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.
Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.
Excuse me.
Ahm.....
Well, Ahm....
Yes, isn't he.
It's great when people who work together can become real friends.
David?
I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
Okay, sir.  Certainly.  Good.
Exactly.  She's in a surprisingly terrible state.  Isn't she, Bean?
Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Congratulations. Marvellous thing.  Bravo.
Quite right, sir.
All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan Day- Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish.  Even Anthony Hopkins is welsh.  Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors.
Sure.  You're right.
I vote for Bart.
You.
Sting?!  Sounds like something you put on a rash.
Yeah, heh heh. Let's just wheel this thing back to the house.
Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
Yeah, really.
Uh...
Huh huh. You mean like this?
You mean there's mre than one?
Uh... I think you scared them off.
Uh, probably, huh huh...Whoa, I think my life is like, flashing in front of my eyes!
Yeah. We can go see Hole and then we can get some hole. Huh huh huh huh.
Could you, like, tell her we're ready to score?
Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
Yeah, maybe some chicks too. Heh heh.
Shut up, dill-hole.
Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in Las Vegas?
Whoa! heh heh. Hey Butt-Head, this chick is pretty cool. She says there's gonna be tons of sluts in Las Vegas! Heh heh heh.
You'll have to speak up son. I have this ringing in my ears. My doctor says it could be related to my heart palpitations. I've had two operations on my heart.
Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
Did you give him a full cavity search?
Attention all units. We've got him. He's in front of a camper in the visitor's lot.
Who knows?
That's right. I'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
No, Jane.
I will <u>never</u> sell this house. I'll be buried in my yard next to Barbara.  Holding hands!  And a good paintbrush!
God, how I have looked forward to this, honey.
Two hours.
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
But I'm not hungry, are you?
Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do?
We're not completely helpless. I've been reading the book. There's a word for people in our predicament, honey.
No, I'm not putting up with this.
I don't know... what are you looking up?
Think of them as death shrouds. And the moaning is important. Really <u>moan</u>!  Practice, practice, practice.
... acts like she's thirty-five.
I didn't --
Little black party dresses?
Let's see if she can get my model back.
All right.
<u>Night of the Living Dead</u>?  It's this gross movie.
Hell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a businessman.  I'm the man what <u>am</u>. <u>Beee</u>tel <u>Jooose</u>!  <u>Who</u> do I gotta kill?
But... the Deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house.
Now, let's get rolling!
The Intermediate Interface chapter on Haunting says it all.  Get 'em out yourself.  It's your house. Haunted houses don't come easy.
Hey <u>you've</u> been on Saturn!  I <u>hate</u> those sandworms!  <u>Yecchhh</u>! I've lost a lot of buddies to sandworms.  So a daughter?  She got good legs? God I love a young leg.
Yes.  I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
Our cemetery?
About what?
You're not gross.  Why were you wearing a sheet?
We're practicing.
I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.
No, dummy.  Two.
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
Delia hates it.
Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --
<u>This is not a joke</u>!  That sheet was full of ghosts.
Nonsense, everytime she says that, the paint peels, and some wild creature tries to kill us.
Yeah yeah, we'll think on it. 'Bye ya, Charles.  You relax up there, ya hear?
Otho, can you do it?
I'm sorry already.
I'm <u>so</u> glad you could leave the city to consult me, Otho.
I thought I saw something.
Gooood!
That's Charles' study.  But you don't have to even look in there. He'll love whatever you do to it.  He's such a sheep.
Oh, they're still here.  They're Just not showing up.
I don't know.
Why not?
Yes.
No.
Yes, I will.
No, Robert.
Yes, I suppose that's true.
... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...  ... Chance...?
Yes, Robert - I am.  I'll go tell Eve about Ben now, Robert.
Of course, Doctor, I understand.
Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
A Black man gave me the message.
Would you care to take it, sir?
Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested.
Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
Why, there certainly is. You must see a doctor, I insist on it. Please, let us take you.
Yes. He's a very careful driver.
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
Yes... I know, Chauncey.
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
Oh, no. She brought me my meals.
Of course.
... I guess I may as well be honest about my feelings, Chauncey, as I know you are I am in love with you... I love you and I want you... And I know that you know it and I'm grateful that you've decided to wait until... Until...
Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.
No. I'm not busy.
So you know Krylov!
Yes. I like that name very much.
And yours, sir - Chauncey Gardiner!  How poetic! Chauncey, a name of uncertain meaning! And Gardiner, a bit of the French, a suggestion of a stroll through the flowers! A beautiful name, my friend!
We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
Thank you.
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
Thank you, Ben.
Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
Of course, who can nowadays? I have trouble writing a post card to my children! Look, we could give you a six figure advance, provide you with the very best ghostwriter, research assistants, proof readers...
I can't read.
No.
... Good evening, Louise.
Is his back feeling better?
... I see.
I always find it surprising, Mr. Gardiner, to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the President, yet manage to remain relatively unknown.
Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas?
... How long have you been living here?
No, I do not have any of those.
... Joe? Who's Joe?
But you won't sign, correct?
Sid, it's useless!
No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.
You heard?
... Yes, I am, Ben.
That's good... That's good.
Hello, Sophie.
Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...
Huh... I'm glad they're along with her, if you know what I mean... How about Jack?
Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
There is no information available on the man before he moved into Benjamin Rand's. It has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the United States Government.
He's an advisor and close personal friend of Rand's! For Christ sakes, they have volumes of data on Benjamin!
Right, Chief.
A coup d'etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself!
Let us toast to the success of the coup.
Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
I'm afraid so.
The one where you're that jewel thief.
I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get your autograph now? It's for .... oh, what the hell, it's for me! I'm your biggest fan!
Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
Hi.
We'll talk about it in the car.
You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
You should feed your animals. They're looking peaked.
Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously.
It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, in an odd sort of way.
You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?
I can't believe it. This is too good to be true.
Sure, after a fashion.
Pardon?
My name is Schwartz.
Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.
Glooph is not a letter, sir.
I'll keep that in mind, sir.
The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.
Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
Why not?
You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings and a halo.
No. Don't be an ass.
Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire!
Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.
Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.
No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course the Great Mantini!
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Do you?
Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
No you mustn't, my child.
But why, Son of Malkovich?
But now we've lost access to Craig.
Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!
When?
But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.
Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.
What's the play?
I can explain about the portal, darling.
Sleepy suddenly.
You've got to be kidding.
Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
What want ye, girl child?
I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.
There was a boy there...said mama was a jailbird...said he could prove it..
Say the Word!
I likes yellow.
Can't say. It's something can't be planned.
You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood?
What'd be the point? Not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You lucky. You got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one of them gone from me. Four taken, four chased and all, I expect, worrying somebody's house into evil. My first born - alls I can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight children and that's all I remember.
The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here.
THE WHITEFOLK?
What you want'em for?
No. I mean work work.
Extra?
Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
But you'll hurt your eyes doin it there. Come sit at the table.
Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
You was friends.
Ella.
Oh yeah. I got big plans.
I don't want to know.
She was only-
What? What? You talking back to me?
Yes sir..You right about that. That's just what I come over to talk to him about. Just that..
Yeah, okay.
And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.
Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john.
Uh-huh.
Her life is in your hands.
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.
No, man, nothing is fucked here--
Well, okay, you're not privy to all the new shit, so uh, you know, but that's what you pay me for.  Speaking of which, would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash? I gotta check this with my accountant of course, but my concern is that, you know, it could bump me into a higher tax--
But I guess she told Dieter.
Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.
NO RULES!  YOU CABBAGE-EATING SONS- OF- BITCHES--
Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in?
Walter, how--
I was bowling--
Life does not stop and start at your convenience, you miserable piece of shit.
What the fuck is he talking about?
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
What's that, Walter?
We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when--
--and bowling.  I'll tell you the truth, Brandt, I don't remember most of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!
I'm unemployed.
...Also, my rug was stolen.
Well I like your style too, man. Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.
Thankie. . . Just one thing, Dude. D'ya have to use s'many cuss words?
Of course you do.  I can see you're anxious for me to get to the point. Well Dude, here it is.  Where's Bunny?
I was talking about my rug.
Oh, no.
He fixes the cable?
No it's fine, really, uh--
The main guy, Dieter--
Maude?
Bunch of assholes.  And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately.
It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just--
I keep telling you, it's the Foundation's money.  Father doesn't have any.
Walter, he peed on my rug--
Huh?
Mark that frame an eight, you're entering a world of pain.
He's fragile, man!  He's very fragile!
That's your answer to everything, Dude.  And let me point out--pacifism is not--look at our current situation with that camelfucker in Iraq-- pacifism is not something to hide behind.
Yeah.
What if it's during a game?
Have it your way.  The point is--
Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say peep when I'm doing business here.
I told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling?
Walter--
"Our" car, Walter?
How the fuck should I know?  I do know that nothing about it indicates--
Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
Now Dude--
No, I'm--
Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot!
Fuck your sympathy!  I don't need your sympathy, man, I need my fucking Johnson!
Near the In-and-Out Burger--
All but one man died?  There at Bitter Creek?
You're going to enter a world of pain, son.  We know that this is your homework.  We know you stole a car--
I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.
Huh?
You know this!
AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK!
No Dude.
Call the medics, Dude.
It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look.
Yeah?
I'll say it again, all right?  You told Brandt.  He told me.  I know what happened. Yes?  Yes?
Look, let me explain something. I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's what  you  call me.  That, or Duder. His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing--
WHAT?!
No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not occurred to me.
Stay away from me!  You bullies! You and these women!  You won't leave a man his fucking balls!
A world of pain.
This is a league game, Smokey!
Impressive.
We'll take 'em in the morning.
He's half yours, partner.
We're going to be working as a unit, you people will be taking orders from me.  So let's get it over with.  I'll give you a free shot, Reinhardt.
Nomak's different.  He's the carrier.  There's something driving him beyond the Thirst.  Something we're missing.
Exactly.  Look at the digestive system. It's been drastically simplified.  Super charged.  And this --
Fry 'em.
I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I do.  It's in my blood.
Ran into a little Reaper trouble myself.
I'll show you.
I should think that would be obvious at this point.
Too bad you're out of it.
You're wasting your time, Blade.  The flechette's a dud.
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing, buttercup.
Ain't nobody here but you and me, chicken wing.  I'd say this is as good a time as any to settle up.
Thiavolos, as we used to say in Greece. The Devil.  Pure Thirst.  Nothing more. He was born a vampire, but he is an anomaly.  Like you.  Unlike the rest of us, however, he feeds on not just humans, but vampires as well.
Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
Two so far.
As scripted?  You've already lost two of your own.  How many more are you willing to sacrifice?
And you'll burn the damn thing out before your next fucking oil change.
After last night?  Dude, I'm a lover, not a fighter.
I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
He didn't. Get over it.
Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.
The way they move, they way they smell --
There are worse things than vampires out there.
Some kind of archive --
If you're not human, then why do you bleed like us? I've seen vampire blood, you don't have it running through your veins.
Some. It's been slow --
Deacon brought me back.
These are my people now. I'm one of them.
I don't know --  Look at this blood smear --
This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear.
No problem.
What?
Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
Perhaps.
Which is why you're here. We could use someone with your experience.
Join the club.
--my God, Nick???
--doubtful, Mrs. Leavitt. The main thing to remember is, whatever the reason, it was for the best-- it meant something was wrong.
Let's talk to your husband--
Buried deep under 200 years worth of soil, ash, and compost layers.
You feel no need to get married or anything.
You said the name "James."
--scared the living shit out of us.
--you should get back into bed.
Here.
I can't.
I know, I know.
<u>Before</u> 5:00--
--no one'll ever know.
Who do you know who can? Where do we go?
Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.
--Cotter: shut up.
I got the tape enhanced--and I managed to sleaze a photo blow-up. Jesus, he's gonna kill me when he finds out about the camera.
--I saw what I saw.
Goes right along with these two.
--a Wiccan--
--oh, Jesus--
No one's been in or out since you left. Would've heard the dogs.
--shit!!!
One of the printers.
Why?
At least you still have the tapes.
Get some more beer.
--she wasn't a witch--we embrace nature, not evil--
Yeah, I know. It's...alright. We're all a little--
Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
Or a blood blister--or a bruise.
You <u>know</u> what we picked up in the woods--
Then just give me one of your explanations that all three of us'll buy.
Yeah.
On the phone. Was it for you?
If that's what you want to do, then you oughta do it. You, uh... you want the bed or the couch?
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty.
Huh? Oh, yeah, I guess. Mm-hmm.
You're bad.
I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right?
Isn't that what you want?
What do you want to know?
I don't follow baseball.
We don't seem to be communicating--
You want to hustle me. I don't want to be hustled. It's as simple as that. Now that I've communicated, why don't you leave?
See, I never knew that.
Yeah.
I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor--
What're you, a fucking marriage counselor?
Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.
Right. Sorry.
What's the point?
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
For what?
You shouldn't have taken the money...
Tuesday night is ladies' night. All your drinks are free.
I've seen a few.
Okay honey.
Shit. let's drink to something else. let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures.
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
Baby wants to fuck.
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Those are my breasts.
Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.  . Hey, pretty, pretty.
Yeah. but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Oh yeah, that's good.
Jeffrey.
Yes.
No.
No. please. I won't.
What?
Do you know?
No.
O.K.
That's not crazy. I like you too.
Don?. Are you in with them?
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like me, huh?
Yes.
That's good.
Does that scare you?
Come on Dorothy.
Sometimes I think I do.
Why are you here?  Hmmmmmmmm!!!! Ok.
No. not really.  but also because I really want you to be alright.
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin' beer.
Maybe so.
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
Yes. I do.
Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
Two.
Could you wait a little while. this key may not fit.
Twice. without her sensing anything?
Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.
Yeah?
I will.  I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
Okay, Sandy.
See ya tomorrow.
Oh yeah?
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret.
No.
... You look beautiful.
Yes.
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
No Jeffrey!!
uh uh.
Yeah?
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. real good.
Um-hmm.
On the plane.
What plane?  We going someplace?  Where we headed?  You have your money.  It's all there.  What the fuck is going on?
The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire.  He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point.
Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
Yeah.  I am.
Yeah, I don't feel so well.
Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute.
Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years.  I'll serve two.
George, I went to the doctor.  I don't have two years.
Which brings me to rule number three: which says, fuck rules one and two, skip bail and take off.
Look, if you really wanna score some dope, I got the guy.
Yes, I am.
Excuse me?
I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important.
The coca is my responsibility!
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
It's your grass.
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
Yeah, I know, it's a lot of weight.
Here's the best part.  We can charge five-hundred a pound.
No fucking way.
Fuck you, then.  I sign nothing.
Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive.
Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ.
Getting it here is no problem.  Trust me.  I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply?  How much can we get?
Congratulations, brother.  I've been waiting for you.
I just got released five minutes ago.
What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me.
Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George.
Mexico.
Mom.
I'm just happy that George has found someone he cares for.
Yes.
With all respect, Padrino.  Diego is my partner.  I do not do business without him.
Freedom.
Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me.
You're not going to trial?
Money.  You and your mother.  All the time chasing it.  I never understood it.
I'll tell her.
He's going down, George.  It's election year.  We're not making any deals.
No thanks, fellas.  You've got the wrong fucking guy.  I'm not a rat.
Tuna.
He's getting middled, too.  And Derek's our partner.  What's good for us is good for him.
Why are you smiling?
What is your name?
Pablo said no.  It's all over.  And I'm never going back.  I have you.  We have the baby.  And there's nothing else. It's just the family now.  Shhh.  Sleep now.
That's right.  Always spying, always judging.  Everyone's laughing at you, you fucking pussy.  You let Diego fuck you in the ass.  Maybe you are a fucking faggot.  You must be fucking Diego because you're not fucking me.
What do you want me to say?  I'm in prison.  You should know.  You put me here.
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
Yeah.
Kristina's fine.
Better than you.
How are you doing?
Yeah, sure, whatever.
You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go.
Yes, I do.
Shortly after I arrived at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute I related to Diego that the crime I was in for was smuggling marijuana. Diego told me he had high level connections in Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into America...
You're looking at him.  We provide the plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want it to go.  You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment.  You assume all the bust risks.  We take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further.  If not, we can forget we had this conversation.
What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
Relax.  I've flown with my old man a million times.  And he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about.
That was it.  Seeing Dulli after fourteen years sealed the deal for me. The rest was just details.  My end was roughly five-hundred thousand.  Kristina and I could have a good life for five hundred grand.  Start over somewhere. One final score.  That's all I needed.
Jesus Christ, I'm getting a boner just looking at it.
The successes obtained are the results of those methods. One presupposes the other and vice versa.
Dien Bien Phu?
Second name.
Second district ...
C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
I don't do that kind of thing.
No, it's better if he doesn't. The house is filled with new people.
Yes ... yes. The problem also involves the UN. I don't know what it's worth, but this way, we'll give the UN the possibility of evaluating our strength.
But it's not even midnight yet!
Why, yes, of course ... But for the moment, let's be satisfied with Algiers! In the mountains our work is always easier.
Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
We'll lower a basket from the window ...
What would Joanne Braslow need with an estate attorney?  She wasn't even mentioned in Marsh's will.
What good does that do -- it's the old will?
Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
How?
Yes.
Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the scene?
No.
We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
Then how did it get into his body?
It would be an added stress to his heart.
What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
Like cats and dogs.
Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier?
Take your pole out of the water, Frank.  The fish ain't biting today.
I'll tell her but she won't take it.
I'm just curious to see if Mr. Troxell reconstructed anything else.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Your Honor, I'm trying to establish the sense of betrayal Miss Lawson felt when she discovered the man she lived with was a different person than she thought he was.
A little after eleven.
Rebecca Lawson.
Thank you.
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
Yes.
Just one last question.  What does the sign on your office door say?
How long were you together?
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
Who was your primary beneficiary?
She said that she was working on a novel and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone with a bad heart.
No further questions.
You called him?
That's enough.
Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
Why does she come to you?
Yes.
No.
I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there.
There was an inquiry.  It was his word against mine.  They believed him.  I was fired.
Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but he was thirty years older than her. Where's the attraction to sleep with someone like that -- to have the kind of sex they had.
I suppose.
I thought he was a kind, gentle man?
Yes.
Dristan nasal spray.
No.
I need to ask you a question.  What made you get in touch with Joanne Braslow?
Yes.
You're assuming the District Attorney is going to file charges.
No pain, no gain?
Sure.  Where to?
I'm the photographer.
It's okay.
It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
Paley could be a problem tomorrow.
Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.
Fuck him!  He tried to shatter mine.
So, sue me.  Things have changed.  I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.
Well, that's kind of how I am right now.
Because I knew you'd think exactly what you're thinking.
Maybe it would be a good idea if you just took Michael.
Sorry.
We have a witness who saw you go into the house at four thirty.
It didn't get there from me.
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
I'm sure you haven't done anything. Have some iced tea. How are the kids?
I know. I don't understand it either.
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
Yeah. But I thought she died.
He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.
Nobody did.
Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.
You're right -- that is sick.
No. What a tragedy. What happened?
They got heat in Michigan.
Heat is heat.
Hmm-mmm.
Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so and then moved to Chicago when I got married.
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
No, not at all --  except those are poisonous.
Sure.
Francesca. Robert.
Not at all.
I thought it was funny.
And how long are you here for?
Why?
You have no reason to feel ashamed. You haven't said anything you don't have a right to. And if anybody tells you different -- you just send them to me.
I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.
Well, let's just call it a compliment and move on.  Did you love teaching?
I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
You drink bug repellent?
No. I'm all right. It's working.
What?
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
But no one in particular.
No. But I love them just the same.
Just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn't necessarily mean they're hypnotized. Just because I've never seen a gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm asleep in the world.
What made you ask such a question?
Yes! Hi.
Yeah. See you later.
I want you to come.
Near the church.
He's a genius. They're not photographs -- they're stories, entire histories captured in moments.
I had a temper.
Try and live a lifetime before Friday. Cram it all in. 
Yes. Absolutely. You have this habit of not needing and that it's hard to break. I understand.  Of course, in that case, why sleep -- you don't need rest or for that matter eat, you don't need food.
I know you! What can this possibly mean to anyone who doesn't "need" meaning -  "Who goes with the Mystery" -- who pretends he isn't scared to death.
Stop it!
I don't want you to say anything. I don't need you to say anything.
I told you! I won't apologize for who I am.
No. Don't do this.
Yes. And I've accepted.
Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
I'm going to miss you.
Okay.
Yeah?
So what the hell's the good news?
Keep smokin', fool.
Take who where?  What you smokin'?
"This is the story of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stones/Gold plated deuce, like the King of Siam/Got his switchblade loose, and a diamond on his hand..." There's the switchblade and there's the diamond.  Don't know where the deuce is parked.
Maurice left.  Tia's taking a bath.
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Well, go find his lazy ass.  I scratch any more tonight I'm gonna have carpal tunnel syndrome.
Bones.
What it will be.
Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
We met.
Time like this, is that what you really want to know?  How I got the fuck in here?
Who?  Who is he?  What is he?
You moved into this block?
How do you know?
Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
I can't find you.
Can't be done.  That place already died and gone to hell.
Bullshit, Dad.  Don't front me.  For once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came from there, too.
Dad?
And you?  Still a pig.  Just a much fatter one.
Look, even if anyone found anything there, it's twenty years ago.  They could never connect it to us.
That's it.  Get out.  Now!
You cut him, or I shoot you.  Make your choice.
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
I'm on my way home.  Can you handle it yourself?
Fuckin' comedian.  See you tomorrow.
That's all we did, steal their ride.
Get that car the hell away from here, now!  I spend a lot of money to keep the cops cool.  But this is the kinda shit that pisses everybody off.
I was planning on waiting until I got the place cleaned out, but -- like the man says, carpe diem.
I was born near here.  My dad's from here.  He never mentioned it.
No thanks.
The blood is still there.  We just gotta figure out where.
Somehow I don't think he stabbed himself in the chest, then buried himself too.
Here, put this in his mouth.
Admit what?
Where is it?
All part of the business.
I'm sorry, Christ, I thought ... it's fucking dark in here.
Why?
It was him.  I'm positive.
See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case.  He wants me to hand the case to Gino.  Then there is no doubt it was me.  Gino will put a bullet in me himself.  But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way!
Caesar, this is crazy.
For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what he says.
Caesar, what are you going to do?
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
I don't know.  We may never know, but I'm going to guess it was a job, maybe the Karpoli family.
Caesar, what are we going to do?
Caesar, someone could see us out here.
I had to.  You made me.
It's all right, sir.
Where's the fucking money?
My brushes, I have to clean my brushes.  Thanks, though.
Yeah, that's it.
The key, yeah, the key's in my pants in the bathroom.
Fuck it, I don't need the key.
Pretty much.  One day at a time.
My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here.  I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?
Yeah.
No, but Caesar does.  He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.
No.  Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do it.  I did it.
No.
Maybe.
I wanted to apologize.
No.
I'm already in your bed.
Is that what her daddy tells her?
I think ...
Like each other?  They hate each other.
It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
Yeah.
Has Caesar ever seen him?
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
Waiting in the apartment next door.
C!  Shit, I'm sorry!
Every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass. It's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart.
Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do.  I'm getting nervous, really nervous.
Don't be sorry.  Help me.
No.
Caesar, come here.  Sit.  We talk now.  You too, Johnnie.
You're asking me a direct question?
Yes.
Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far.  Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, does it?  We'll clean up the field.  You clean up your budgets.
I want a second opinion.
<u>No you're not</u>.  You're not going anywhere.  I'm shutting this down.
Treadstone?
I don't know.
<u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
Yes.  Is he there?
Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
Thanks.
Well, I mean it's a tough business, isn't it?  Cutthroat.
Excuse me?
You have blood on your pants.
Listen to what you want.
I was shot twice in the back.
You were tired.  Here...  For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast.  So what do you dream about?
Looks familiar?
Thanks for the ride.
You got me pretty fucking curious.
-- forget it --
Nykwana Wombosi. 
Go back to the hotel.
You could do that?
I won't let that happen.
xxxxxx
Think I could rent a scooter?
Enhance it.
-- I'm on it --
All of them?
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
You're on a boat.  A fishing boat. Italian flag.  We're out of Vietri.  It's the cold that saved you.  The water.  The wounds are clean.  I'm not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay.  It's clean.
I don't remember Zurich.
I don't know.
Trouble with your air-conditioning.
What do I have to do.
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
In fact, killing people -
I understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers. People want value for money and a cost-effective service.
Gillian Layton?
You sound worried.
Yes, thanks.
Not really, no.
You got the wrong man.
I'm sure you have
You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
Say it was a mistake.
Do you know what you're doing.
Where do I get it stamped?
Information Adjustments.
If you say so.
It's you ... it's you ...
Who are you?
Yes, of course. Sorry.
Where are you taking me?
Who is this war against, Sam?
Well, terrorists of course.
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
What?
Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll kill us!
What?
Yes.
No. No. I'm fine. I was worried sick about you ... I thought ...
Yes.
C'mon. We've got to get out of here.
Information Retrieval.
Really.
You've been promoted.
I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion from the word go! He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!
Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
What?
Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.
I delivered it.
All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified.
What! Shit!
Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next door, ha ha!  My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome to Expediting.
What?
You haven't switched it on.
Mistake?
Yes. Not my department ... I'm only records. It seems that Mr Buttle was overcharged by Information Retrieval. I don't think they usually make mistakes ... but, er ... I suppose we're all human.
I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
Shirley and I come here regularly. I love romantic lingerie.
What is it?
No. Wait here.
You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong.
You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again.
I got some forms here to fill out about that accident when you get the time.  I'll fire you tomorrow. I promise.
Es impossible.
You can trust me on this one.
It's a miracle.
Mary said you might be coming.
Got a beer?
Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.
Boy can't shoot for shit, either. Goddamn that's hot.
I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
You're going to three-four Avenue C, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information.
Ten-four.
Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy.  Me.  I swing like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three, game six, World Series.
Oh man, Bucky.
His heart's beating.
I guess there's always a chance.
Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.
No.
Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
Sleeping.
Ah, no. I was.  It's hard to explain. She had a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too.
How long you been doing this?
Come on up.
We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me.
No prisoners. Don't worry, Frank, just a little psychological first aid.
C'mon, Tom. The city's burning.
It's not our job to taxi drunks around.
Someone's gonna die someday causa that bum, going to have a cardiac and the only medics will be taking care of Mr. Oh.
Relax, will you.
You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.
Yeah, you're right.
You see, he's giving it to us anyway.
You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
And the rule was...
We're conversing...Oh my, the names of the entire Cabinet has slipped my mind.  What are they?
It's not loaded.
Which would you prefer?
Ravenous homosexual.
Why do you say that?
Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?
Eleven and a half.
It was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again.  Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?
What do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...I'll bet you were the only one aware of it...
Let me think a second.  It's tough.
This isn't friendship.
Hi.  Will I ever sing again?
Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
Really?
It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
Wipe me out?
Prepare what?  You have Saturday's news handy?
Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
Yes.
Yes, there is.
We could...
How do I get out of here?
Bad manners.
I see the change in you -- I see it.
Nobody else had it.
Oh.
Look, I can start up with him again if you really...
It's Paul.
I could use somebody to talk to on a day like this.  Sorry. Go ahead.
How are you at back rubs?
I didn't even have the chance to get really good at sports.  I wasn't bad. I thought I was starting to do interesting features but hockey is big at the station and...
I agree with you -- you're not qualified.  So get qualified.  You can insist on being better prepared.  You don't have to just leave it as...  'I don't write.  I'm not schooled. I don't understand the news I'm reading. But at least I'm upset about it, folks.'
Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
Billion.
Okay, billion...right, of course. They told me I could have any producer I wanted -- and I want you.
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
Hey, I know how to have a burger by myself.  I feel like a little solitude.
I'll be the judge of that.
Too many smart people in one room -- it's not healthy...
What?
Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
What pills did you take?  You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.
No.  Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
Oh, good.
Yeah.
Good.  That's it...See you.
Uh-uh.
Good...Another is you're trying to make it all about sex and heat and nothing else.
I'm not sure.  It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news.
What?
I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl.  I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.
This is a one-way argument.  We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger deal.  I go to London right after that. So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here.  The plane's boarding.  You're good at deadline.  Here's your ticket.
Then you should stay here.
God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind? Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him.  I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?
Right back to you.
Shh!
Sit in this chair, and I'll pose you.
Are you nervous, Walter?
N-no...
Are you a virgin?
Walter!  Jeez!
Sorry...
Oh, I don't know.  Smart people. Creative people I guess.
Of course I do!
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
What?
It was.
I'm honored to know this man.
Leonard, what are you doing?
Yeah then you could unload - sell this stuff for a lot more.
I know.
Well I was uh, just looking...
Have a seat -
Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
I don't know, it just happened, I guess.  I didn't mean to.
Well Why not?  I gotta make statues Leonard.  You heard Maxwell, they want me to make them.  I can't go back to being a busboy!
I'm holding for Lieutenant Beldere!
I didn't do nothing wrong!  That was Mayolia's!  I didn't ask her for it.  I don't know about any -
Well I'm overjoyed.
I worked in one of them.  Back in Alaska. 
Gee.  Thanks.
Let it inspire you.  Maybe it will let you think of me.
Hello Walter.  I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
I was just straightening up the place.
My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
That's it, man.  That's the whole story.
Oh, yeah, and then you'll never call me.
Get away from here.
I mean it.
Which way did she go?
Have you gained a few pounds?  Maybe it's that outfit...
You were having a nightmare.
I thought we were meeting here.
I'm here with Jenny.
You left me a message?
I'm out of here.  Jenny.
Have you ever thrown up in the front row of a Richard Marx concert?
No...
You guys are thrashed.
Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of miss my knees, though.
God!  Unbelievable.  Vampires.
It's nothing.  It doesn't hurt.
I'll back that up.
Why'd you come back?
I think I could help.  You gonna tell me you don't need help?
Cool.  I could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches.  What do you need?
I'm going to the senior dance.
Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
You're the boss, boss.  I just thought maybe we should wait.
Like my homework.
I know.  I like your little outfit.
Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. You should have been taught, prepared.
You don't understand.  You have been chosen.
I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out.  For your parents.
Uh... gym.
No -- you don't have to --
Don't you see what's happening? You're changing.  You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of.  God, this hurts.  I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working.  I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.
Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
A what?
Buffy...
I...
Not if you're careful.
Watchers?
It isn't important.
Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
I guess.
Yes, I'm sure they do.  This place is everything you said it was, Amilyn.
Could be.
Good.
Okay, what else?
Oh, baby!
No --
But --
Buffy?
As long as there's room for three in it.  What, didn't you bring your new friends?
Honey, don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love. They'll say the strangest things.
God, I never thought of that.
I figure we could work on some fundamentals even if we don't make love.
Sure.  Unsnap my stockings.
I'll be back when we lose.
Yeah, Skip, it's me.  Jeez...Jeez...God...Jeez...
I won't be needing these anymore.
You didn't get "lured".  Women never get lured.  They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it--"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.
Fact is you're afraid of meeting a guy like me 'cause It might be real so you sabotage it with some bullshit about commitment to a young boy you can boss around--  Great deal.  You get to write self- indulgent little poems all winter about how hard it is to find a man even though you just sent him packing-  So what do you really want?  You wanta be a tragic woman figure wallowing in the bullshit of magic?  Or do you want a guy?
You got me all confused.
Aren't we all?
I think of you and the "boy" all the time.
I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to.  Lately I'm not so sure.
Whatta you mean "why not"?  Are you gonna play forever?!
What?
Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
He'll learn.
Well shit, then, let's fuck.
We gonna fuck or what?
Chicken bone cross take the curse off this bat and bring me hits.
Beg me again!
I thought I was--
I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.
An' he scrambled the son of a bitch.  Having fun yet?
God damn it I'm sick of you calling me "Meat"!  You wanta step outside!
I won't have to.
Hey, guys, I got a game to pitch.
Then go.
You fuck!
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?
Fear and ignorance.
Maybe you do.  Y'know I'm starting to like this game--baseball's a helluva good way to make a living.
Crash, shut the door.
C'mon, Meat.  You can't hit me 'cause you're starting to think about it already, you're starting to think how embarrassing it'll be to miss, how all these people would laugh.  C'mon, Rook--show me that million dollar arm 'cause I'm getting a good idea about the five cent head--
Shut up--I like this song...  April in Paris, this is a feeling, No one can ever reprieve...
We're getting married.
Better find our bonus baby, eh?
It's a league record.
--we had the gun on him tonight-- the last five pitches he threw were faster than the first five. 96 miles an hour, 98, 97, 97. 97.   He's got the best young arm I've seen in 30 years.
They called me up to the Show and I wanta tell Crash goodbye.
He goes to a whorehouse every night?
Hello, Senator.
But what happens when they do find out?
Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a fuckin' hero sandwich here.
Oh, good.
Yeah, yeah. I know that.
Lester...
Sam, I - I don't know where she is, okay?
I'll call you right back.
Okay.
I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose, honey, I'll -
What do you think about me movin' out here?  What's the matter? You got a problem with that?
Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
Then he called me a faggot.
You're still eight pounds over.  What's the reason for this?
Nope, there's no way.
Listen...
Listen, Nick, you gotta understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.  It's all over, I'm gonna tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license.  And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand?
I don't wanna come along with you.
All right, fine.
What happened to me? What happened to you?
You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife.
Listen, I would -
The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem.
Okay?
Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
Back -
Back - Back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you?! When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?! Get this through your head, you -
I don't know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don't know...  She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.
I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
How'd you know I was here?
Okay. You come by the house?
What can I do?
That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris.
What is it?
Hey, Mitch.
I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
What're you... what're you pitching me, here?
Just what I said. You'll be set up for the rest of your life. That I can promise you.  Want to take a chance?
Why're you crying?
Yeah.
You're with me now.
Yeah. Yeah.
The only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. We gotta put it in a bank.
Good, so then you could tell me what the money is for.
What? What?!
If not for me, at least for Amy.
Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself.
Right.
I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up.
...I-I... made some mistakes and I spent some money.
...the rest of the two million is still there?
Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.
With what?
He wanted a watch, too.
First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days?  I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.
At the most, which is impossible for him.
Let go of me! Let go of me!
I'll go, but I want my money right now!
I'm going to the bank and I'm getting my jewelry too!
And don't send your guys down there to stop me! I mean it.
You're not takin' Amy.
Get out of here!
What'd you have?
Why do you want to do that?
I wouldn't do that...
I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.
...and hypocrisy.
How many kids do you have?
Mr Rothstein.
Well...
These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off.
Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you.
No.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Thanks, Nick.
We're not gonna go see any fuckin' elephants, okay?
Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?
Yes.
I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
That's not a problem, that's not a p-
I can't.
Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm sorry.
Yeah?
You've gotta be kidding me! 
Nicky, I'm sorry.
Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born.
He's not here?
Carmine's gone.
Oh.
Carmine left?
No, I won't calm down! He's my husband!
I know.
Are you sure?
Keepin' Remo happy with money was the greatest insurance policy in the world.
I'll be right out.
Yeah, no shit.
Mm, you want to steal it? 
Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
Yeah.
Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
Hm.
Sure did.
You fucked with me for the last time!
Okay, yeah.
Well, you might as well get somethin' out of it.
What's the matter?
Okay?
I am.
That's right.
Here.
So, he knows where you are. That means he's sending some guys over here probably right now.
It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem, you know.
Come here, come here.
What's takin' so long over there?
Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?
Yeah, what's to stop him?
Take it easy!
Take it easy. What could you do? I mean, she threw herself at you, right?
Fuck you!
Kill me, you fuck, kill me.
Yeah.
Since when do you talk like that?
That's enough.
Take it easy, though.
You have to dial nine first.
Yew'll be ovah in the naxt tehn minutes...
What's the matter?  What are you saying?
Are you sure?
At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
Uh Brock, today you are without me...
Somewhere very far away, very quiet, and very...  This is all wonderful, Selina, but...But I'm afraid I can not rest until all my sister's killers are brought to justice...That one-armed monster..
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
Pass!
He didn't remember to roll up his window...
Why am I still troubled...
How could I forget. Mammoth--go pet the kitty.
Absolutely.
I'll put that in the report--after you shoot her.
"A superhero's job is to protect.." Sorry, I can't take you seriously...I overheard you say that tomorrow the Cult of Good will be dead--I should be so lucky--what did that mean?
You can't get away with..
Hello, Rachel. I'm Selina.
You Career girls have no idea what we go through.
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
Hey, I thought...
Uh, it's just--that woman out there-- that horrible Hag. She's the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter--And now she's built a hut in the back..Why did you...
Yes, I'm pretty amazing. You should see this...It came this evening.
Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..
But I'm not a hero. I'm nobody's heroine..I'm nothing. You've said so yourself many times.
We met on the Internet. The Captain put out a cryptic message calling for a new order of crimefighters. We don't even know each other's true identities...
The kicks..the rush..you mean, like pulling heists..faking your own deaths..killing innocent bystanders...like Mexican angels.  I know you're a woman. Do you?
You could've made me lose my call.
I didn't hurt you.
Or relieve me of it later.
I'm the one they'd be looking for.
Not this minute.
Will you relax?  This in no way affects our business.  Go on.
What do you keep making me out to be?
I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal.
I can't talk any louder.  They might hear.
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
No -- nothing.
What makes you say that?
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
I hear them coming upstairs.  I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep.  So don't talk.  Don't say a word or they'll hear it.
Rachel!  They're going after Rachel now -- and I can't stop them.
Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.
They don't know you.  They won't listen.
What about the others?
What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
Hey drop it, okay?
Sometimes I paint.
I've got to ask somebody.
Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
It's not your fault, Theo.  You tried.
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
Even if you found us -- what then?
To hide it from the I.R.S.
When they first started questioning Jack -- he answered them in that tone he usually reserves for me.  And they began beating him.  And I watched.  And I didn't feel anything ... What kind of a person am I?
Or somebody else there is listening in --
She's a child.  She might panic. She doesn't know me.  She might not come to me.  She might just run.
Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
You timed that beautifully.
You knew about me.
L.A.P.D.
Absolutely.  And Topanga Canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if I recall.
I don't hear him moving around anymore.
Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good.  That's on their head.  All I did I was put him there.
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
You, I would've noticed.
I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face.
Dial him up.  We need him to run interference.
Some people fall apart in a pinch. But you shine.
Why are we stopping?
As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked.  That angelic little face wasn't me at all.  I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was.  That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you.
Naturally.
That's not good enough.
That's a skill you acquire when you do fantasy phone sex for a living. I must've had thirty regulars salivating at 4.99 per minute.
Pull over!  Pull over someplace.
-- The phones, Theo.  Don't leave any of them behind.  The cops could pull up a record of all our calls and -- find you.
You mustn't hang up.
It should take me twenty minutes. Where are you coming from?
I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
And then?
I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she?
And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
What does it take to kill you?
We're gonna get there first.
I've got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards.
Stay put!  I know my way around.
Brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away.  In which case you just warned them.
If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
Undercover.
I thought so.
Yeah.
He's what she should run a mile from.
Who knows the secrets of the human heart.
How?
Nice.
Hi, Jimmy.
An excellent quality.
Stop it, Dil --
No. Tell him to go fuck himself.
C'mon, babe! You know what I like... Easy!
Who the fuck is he?
Charming.
Fuck off, Dave.
What's it to you?
And what's it like?
Not me.
Must be.
Yes, thank you.
What was that all about?
The things a girl has to put up with.
Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all right on your own?
Doesn't know the meaning of the word.
Tried to. Sit down, will you?
No.
Maybe.
A real gentleman...
Give it over, Dil --
Do you care, Jimmy?
Nothing's wise.
I know that.
Probably.
Delirious.
No.
Do you like me even a little bit?
You didn't.
Then say it.
I'd do anything for you, Dil.
It's my name, Dil --
I asked you a question, honey -- were you there too --
Do I?
Where am I to go, Jimmy?
You know her, Jimmy?
Absolutely. Long as she can keep it. Isn't that right, James...
There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.
I know.
So you did fuck up.
What do you mean?
You're never out, Fergus.
Yes?
I take pride in my work.
I sincerely hope so.
Get that thing off me, Fergus --
So?
He described me down to a T. Knows what Jude looks like.
It's your decision.
He's at home.
Fuck you, too --
And who is she?
Good. So what do you think?
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
Kill me.
Don't you think of it, fucker.
Don't I know it.
That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
Best game in the world.
How different?
Why?
Do you?
I don't know her.
Take her picture. C'mere.
Like the one about the frog?
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?
I said you bastard -- stop --
Hurling --
Nice lady.
I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
No. The doctor said it would be bad for my -- thermostat.
Adam --
Why?
No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
Of course there is!
Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- it's got to be something around here.
I know, but this is all we've got left.
Look.
Why? So you can kill me too? Tex is dead, I've seen him! He said Dyle did it!
Don't be an idiot!
You mean spies and things like that?
Only we call them agents.
Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
Because they're still here.
He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.
No.
Dead? Mr. Bartholomew -- maybe you'd better tell me what this thing's all about.
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
Me? Why me?
Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
Oh.
We wait -- with our mouths shut.
Open it.
Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that.
You're out, Dyle -- right now!
I'll take that.
Yes, he is. He was my brother.
Your --
Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
Come here.
Why can't you be serious?
I think I love you, Alex --
Viens, Jean-Louis -- we're going to have a treasure hunt.
You're a big help. Can I have one of those?
Let me know what you want -- I'll pick a suit that matches.
I don't believe it.
Are you trying to say that I might have killed Charles and Scobie?
The man's the same, even if the name isn't.
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
In your money, perhaps $65,000.
Forty-five thousand.
No. For a few minutes they were mine -- that is enough.
And if it is?
Why bother him?
Meaning what?
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
Stop it!
About how wealthy would you say?
One more question. Is this your husband's passport?
Okay.
We won! We won!
It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild.  We don't know each other, do we?
Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list 
The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
Thank you.
Charles sold it all -- at auction.
Something modest but clean -- and near enough to UNESCO so you can take a cab when it rains -- okay?
Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me.
Don't you know I could already be arrested for transporting a minor above the first floor?
Be careful, Peter.
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
Don't put yourself out.
Yes?
Wha -- what do you want?
I admit I moved to Paris because I was tired of American Provincial,
The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!
He took care of Charlie for us.
Who invited you?
I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
Why?
I never fucked Rod.
I get the imports.
Ok!
Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.
I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
Should we close down any eruption?
She's still a virgin.
I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
St. Michael's.
No. She ate a pistol for lunch one day.
Really?
You gave me a 'D'.
My house is just a couple of blocks away. Why don't you come on over and clean those cuts up.
Of course I'm scared.
Mark Shale.
Why?
Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.
I don't watch him eat everyday.
Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . .
FINE. Are you?
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
You're sweet. I really wish someone had thrown a party like that when I was your age. My life might have been very different.
Did Sharon say no?
You know I want to go with you.
I'm not using him as an excuse.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
Yes?
You can ask me anything.
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
Attacked how?
You didn't believe her?
They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
And the police did nothing?
The principal?
Are you Jody?
Ok.

Art.
Since today.  New policy.
Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit!
Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  That shit will be worthless by noon.
You want cash?
You gave him ice cream, didn't you?  Come on, let's go.
...excuse me.  Can you fix this?
No, you gotta go to McGrud-...
No, no, no.
You stole this truck.
You stole this truck! That's...
I didn't steal the truck! He owed it to me!  Anyway, the important thing is I'm not goin' through Missoula!
Hey.
God-...
All right.
I was thankin' you, asshole!
You wanna hit me?
 
Shut up, shut up!  It's beeping.
Come on, old...
Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us!  Everybody  dies!
...do we?
Okay. 
I'm goin'.  I'm goin', baby.  I'm goin', I'm goin'.
Oh, shit.  Come on, old...
I made it!
 
Hey!
 Go, go.

Okay.  All right.  Okay. 
You're not dangerous!  You're crazy!  I ain't gettin' in this damn thing!
Then stay...
...here!

What?
Okay.
You're fucked, man.
You know what I'm sayin'?

Are you all right?
We're gonna die!

What?
 Okay.
 All right.  Okay.


Go, go, go! 
Tunnel.
What?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sorry.
They'll meet you at the top.
What'd you come back for?!

I know where the  blame belongs.  But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew.  The government did...
And let me guess.  You failed.

Forget about him.
Knowing you, Brynner, you've got buyers waiting to buy! You're not gonna use that...
And I'm warning you, Leo.  Don't test me. Get your men and your machines off my radar screen in five, or three million people will die.

You don't think it's that bad, do you, sir?  I mean, Long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant.  The stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet.

Quite a getup for jacking...

I don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is all about.

Row twenty-three, section C.
But that means that most of the valley's been sold in the last few months.
They're calling it an accident.
That's too bad.
Too bad?
My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come up with any results.
Are you sleeping with her? Come, come, Mr. Gittes. You don't have to think about that to remember, do you?
You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't.
Yeah.
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
Just find the girl.
What is it?
How do you do that?
Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to L.A. after all. It's very simple.
Who do you blame for that? Her?
Do you remember the figures we discussed?
Just bring your checkbook.
You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.
Thanks. You know something, Jake?
You bet your ass you don't. You can't even pay me off.
Call me Jake. Careful driving home, Curly.
No thanks.
Curly, where's your car?
Tell her later.
Plus what I owe you?
I'll throw that in too.
Curly, you know how long I been in business.
Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
Well you own a lot of land.
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
You mean that's what you're going to call it.
When I do, you'll hear about it.
Just to be on the safe side, we had Loach here give you a ring.
How did she...  ...happen to have them?
C'mon I'll show you.
Shut up.  Go on.
What's the maid's address?
Tell us about it on the way to Pedro.
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
Yes.
Iced tea.
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
Oh... thank you.
Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.
Why?
I don't believe you.
Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no.  Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.  Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.
The Valley?
In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25,000 acres.
Where are you going?
It has to do with my father.
You saw my fa... father? When?
That's what your father said. You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing?
What about?
Because of Hollis? Because she was seeing your husband? Was that it? Jesus Christ, say something. Was that it?
Aren't you coming back with me?
What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30.
You know any good criminal lawyers?
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
She's my daughter.
Get me the Times. Whitey Mehrholtz.  And how about that snotty broad?  What does she think, she's perfect? Coming in waving her lawyers and her money at me  so goddam smug. She's no better than anybody else in this town.
I was the one who pretended to be Mrs. Mulwray, remember?
A Miss Sessions calling.
Ida Sessions.
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
We don't reveal the names of our guests as a matter of policy. I know you'd appreciate that if your father came to live with us.
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
And Mulwray isn't?
Help yourself.
Hope so. He's working for us.
Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will. Dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought.  That's news.
Yes...
When it comes.
Well, tell you what, pal. If Ida wants to see me she can call me at my office.
That's swell. But how about here?  Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Yeah, I'll do that.
It's personal. Has he been out long?
They were partners.
All she needed for that was the phone book!
Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives.
Sue people like that they're liable to be having dinner with the Judge who's trying the suit.
Neither do I.
Well, you never know, do you?
Cross was looking for her all over the country. Offered rewards, everything. Felt real sorry for him, with all his money.
With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt! 
Too bad!
For example, at this moment the film's out of focus. Go see.
No! You mean right at the end?  ALFREDO That's right, Toto, right at the end? And don't ask me what it means. If you figure it out, let me know...
Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. And if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...
Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed.  When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that the case?...You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born...But not now, it's impossible. Now you're blinder than I am. 
Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
Sssssh, Be quiet, pretend everything's normal. I'm Salvatore.
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
Politics. He's the district representative. We met at the University in Pisa.
Nor have I. Even though you disappeared...  But what's the point of talking about it? We risk being pathetic and ridiculous.  You still live in Rome?
I told him I'd take his advice. But before I went away I left you that note...  I was on my way down the stairs... 
It takes years to get there. And years to come back...Now go to bed, Toto, it's late.
How are you, Mr. Thatcher?
I can't take shorthand.
I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
You're right, Mr. Bernstein.
Two hundred and one thousand, six hundred and forty-seven.
We certainly do.  Vacation's over - starting right after dinner.  But right now - that lady over there -  - that's the new society editor, I take it?  You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?
You don't really think so?
Well, the way I look at it -  -  You want to know what I really think would be wonderful?
Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in?
From before the beginning, young fellow. And now it's after the end.  Anything you want to know about him - about the paper -
Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -
Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
It's not trick to make an awful lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money.  Thatcher!
I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so well of Susie's art anyway.
He thought she was great, Mr. Thompson. He really believed that.  He put all his ambition on that girl.  After she came along, he never really cared for himself like he used to.  Oh, I don't blame Susie -
Certainly not.
Yes.
Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the "Enquirer" - who were with the "Chronicle" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the "Chronicle" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper?
Probably.  There's always a chance, of course, that they'll change Mr. Kane - without his knowing it.
Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland.
But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
That'll be all today, Mr. Carter. You've been most understanding. Good day, Mr. Carter!
I made Miss - Miss Alexander send you the note.  She was a little unwilling at first -  but she did it.
I'm protecting myself every way I know how, Mrs. Kane.  This last week, I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected. If the people of this state learn what I found out this week, he wouldn't have a chance to - he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher.  Well, what I'm interested in is seeing that he's not elected.  I don't care whether they know what I know about him.  Let him keep right on being the Great, Noble, Moral -  Champeen of the people.  Just as long as -
I'm surprised he got the votes he did.
Charles.
It can wait.
I don't see what else you can do, Charles.  If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has -
What are you waiting here for? Why don't you go?
Toothache.
I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
I know...  But you do look so silly.
On the chiffonier.  Here.
A rooster?
And I know too many people.  Obviously, we're both lonely.  Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
Oh, me -
Is that what you want to do?
Yes, I would.  That's why I asked.
Yes.  The bulldog's just gone to press.
Can't we go back, Charlie?
I'm going to leave you.
Can you prove it isn't?
I think we'll have to send our friend Wheeler a cable, Mr. Bernstein.  Of course, we'll have to make it shorter than his, because he's working on an expense account and we're not.  Let me see -  Mike!
What're you going to do, Charlie?
I mean I've got a job for you.
Good.
- and that copy of the "Enquirer" said the President should be killed.
I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
What's wrong, Brad?
Are you finished?
Yes.  Now, will you let me go to Chicago?
I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie.  We'll let the salary stay where it is.
You don't happen to have a cigar, do you?  I've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one - who thinks I'm going to stop smoking...  I changed the subject, didn't I?  Dear, dear!  What a disagreeable old man I've become.  You want to know what I think of Charlie Kane?  Well - I suppose he has some private sort of greatness. But he kept it to himself.  He never - gave himself away -  He never gave anything away.  He just - left you a tip.  He had a generous mind.  I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions.  That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it -  But he didn't believe in anything except Charlie Kane.  He never had a conviction in his life.  I guess he died without one -  That must have been pretty unpleasant.  Of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death.  But we do know what we're leaving ... we believe in something.  You're absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?
Sorry, Mr. Leland.
Was he in love?
I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!  Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.
On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?
We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode - of which you, Mrs. Kane, are the sole owner.
The banks are out of luck, eh?
Oh, I don't know.  They'll clear all right.
He wanted me to be comfortable - Oh, why should I bother?  You don't believe me, but it's true.  It just happens to be true.  He was really interested in my voice.  What are you smiling for?  What do you think he built that opera house for?  I didn't want it.  I didn't want to sing.  It was his idea - everything was his idea - except my leaving him.
It's not the same.
Now he's going to launch into his rap about how he's just doing his job; following orders.  Friends, let me tell you about another bunch of hate mongers that were just following orders: they were called Nazis, and they practically wiped a nation of people from the Earth... just like cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette smoking is the new Holocaust, and those that partake in the practice of smoking or sell the wares that promote it are the Nazis of the nineties! He doesn't care how many people die from it! He smiles as you pay for your cancer sticks and says, "Have a nice day."
You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?!
What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!
I take it she likes the guy.
Dick.
So where is he?
No, this is great.
Why aren't there any lights?
I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.
He was?
You dog! I didn't see you go back there.
I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.
No, you're not really getting married?
Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.
No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people.
Stop it. He's a nice guy.
I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years.
It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
You work in a market, all right.
The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.
I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you.
You're such an asshole.
He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note.
Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.
I'm easy, but I'm not that easy.  See you later, handsome.
We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
Just me.
With this guy locked in?
Excuse me?
Give me a stick, pretty boy! I'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass.
This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.
What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
We get... what... twelve minutes of game, and it's over? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!!  I'm not even supposed to be here today!
The boss called. Arthur fell ill.
Bunch of savages in this town.
I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule.  Is the Pelican flying?
Seven months.
She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.
Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
Empire.
There was something else going on in Jedi. I never noticed it until today.
All right, Vader's boss...
Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
Yeah.
All those innocent contractors hired to do a job were killed- casualties of a war they had nothing to do with.  All right, look-you're a roofer, and some juicy government contract comes your way; you got the wife and kids and the two-story in suburbia-this is a government contract, which means all sorts of benefits. All of a sudden these left-wing militants blast you with lasers and wipe out everyone within a three-mile radius.  You didn't ask for that. You have no personal politics. You're just trying to scrape out a living.
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.
Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin...
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
Yes, you do. You always back down. You assume blame that isn't yours, you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off, you buckle like a belt.
I don't know. You going to lock the video store?
We're not playing in the street.
One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? 
Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.
Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
She meant nothing to you!
Exactly, which means I can't close it for another hour so we can both go to a wake.
Just... go! Go open the video store.
I want to rent a movie.
There's a difference. Those were obligations. Obligations that could not have been met at any later date. Now renting videos-that's just gratuitous, not to mention illogical, considering you work in a video store.
Living proof.
Holy shit. That girl?
As opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here.
Then how come you got the fine?
Because I'm happy.
No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
Bunch of savages in this town.  Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.
There's no lights back there.
WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?  WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM?
Why do I have this life?
I should shit or get off the pot.
You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.
Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
...If I wasn't such a fucking coward.  It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.
Point is-I'm not the kind of person that disrupts things in order to shit comfortably.
Thanks.
You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
No thanks. I'll take care of it. We've got a lot of shit to talk about.
To say the least.
Get the fuck outta here already.
You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
THE GLADES MOTEL?
Pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body?
I... I don't believe this...
He died in the bathroom.
That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.
Veronica.
Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.
I'm trying.
So I'm told.
I hate this fucking place.
Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...
I'm not even supposed to be here today!
Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep!
Why did you agree to come in then?
She called you, didn't she?
Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.
I touched a nerve.
It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
Do you know how many different men I've had sex with?
Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of.
Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
Let it go...
Um. Thirty-seven.
I'm going to class.
Because going down it's a big deal! I used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later I'd go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved.
I'm glad you've calmed down a bit.  Hi, Randal.
...it isn't there. Yes.
Thank you for being rational.
Thank you for the lasagne.
If you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it? Instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back!
And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I've gone down on a couple guys!
Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
Fuck you.
Excuse me, but have you been here all day?
No way.
English.  Come on, "Berserker!" Girls think sexy.
I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.
You hope what feels good?
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
Yo. I'll see you at that party.  I'll see you there?
Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos!
I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.
Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today.  C'mon with us.
What usually eats a banana?
So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
It can't fly in this weather.
The money!
I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
I love you, too.
Sure you can.
Three...
Don't say that.  You'll embarrass Frank.
Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber...
Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
You're saying, I don't understand?  I'm the <u>only</u> one who does understand.  I'm the one you lived with for two years, I'm the one you made promises to, I'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all.  Believe me, there's been times I didn't know what I wanted to do more, love you or hate you.  But the one thing in our relationship that I did know and still do know is that I <u>understand you</u>.
If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear.
That's no good. It'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. If they show, they'll take you too.  Why'd you have to come up here?!
Of course I do.
I won't do it.  No way.
What the fuck you mean you burned it?
Who's going with you?
You're looking at him.
Climb, Gabe, climb!
Ask the questions.
Down there you buy a life, up here you earn it or die.  How's your health?
Primed to go off right over his head, officer.
Richard Travers.
Welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, well. To what do I owe the extreme pleasure of this surprising visit? Georgie rises.
Come, come, my little droogies. I just don't get this at all. The old days are dead and gone. For what I did in the past I've been punished.
Of course. Food alright?
Thank you, sir.
Yes. They want to help.
Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
Well, shall we get down to it?
Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.
Sorry, Em, I wanted it to be like... a big surprise for you and pee.
Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?
To what do I owe this extreme pleasure, sir? Anything wrong, sir? Deltoid "playfully" grabs Alex's hair.
I've been doing nothing I shouldn't, sir. The millicents have nothing on me, brother, sir, I mean. Deltoid pulls Alex down on the bed.
Not true, sir. It was only a slight tolchock. She was breathing, I swear it.
Well, er, I think that was something that they hadn't planned for, you see, Missus, I'm very fond of music and always have been, especially Beethoven, Ludwig van... Beethoven. B... E... E... He leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.
You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?
That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it.
Do you still feel suicidal?
Well done, Frank. Julian, get the car, will you please?
New way? What's this about a new way? There's been some very large talk behind my sleeping back, and no error. Let me hear more.
I did, sir.
No, sir, I feel really great.
Keeping fit then?
There, there mother, it's alright. He doesn't mean it. You were in the papers again, son. It said they had done great wrong to you. It said how the Government drove you to try and do yourself in... and when you think about it, son... maybe it was our fault too in a way... your home's your home when it's all said and done, son. Em sobs.
Let me get up.
Murder, sir.
Right. Sign here for your valuable property. Alex signs.
No, sir.
Lice?
But it was horrible.
You've heard Beethoven before?
Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.
Patients who've sustained the kind of injuries you have often have dreams of this sort. It's all part of the recovery process.
Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.
Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.
Excuse me, missus. No time for the old in-out, I've just come to read the meter. Slide of bird's nest with eggs.
Eggiwegs. I would like to smash 'em. Pick up th elot and f... owww... He slams his hand down and cries out with pain.
Fucking hell...
And when do I get out of here then?
That!... Using Ludwig van like that! He did no harm to anyone. Beethoven just wrote music.
Father - may I ask you a question in private?
Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
Where did you hear about this? Whose been talking about these things?
I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.
Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul.
Have you been receiving medical treatment for any serious illness?
Sir.
Answer when the Governor asks you a question you filthy young swine!
And there's Will the English in the Muscleman coffee mesto saying he can fence anything that anything that any malchick tries to crast.
Aye. You should have let us know, lad, not that we're not very pleased to see you again. All cured too, eh?
What?
You got a deal.
Let me guess.  Clarinet?
It's no big deal.
But not now?
I was heading back to my garage.  It's on the way.
You're kidding me.
I never lie.  Ask Max.  Max, have I lied yet?
Then let's have it.
Can't say that I do.
Federal?
They found him dead in his own cab down by the Port Authority.
Elvis?
Of course I'm proud.  You know he started with nothing?  Look at him today.  Playing concerts.
Vincent...
I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
You should start a union.
I don't talk about it, you know...  No offense.
Yeah.  Lucky with the lights.
Regulations?  These guys don't even give you sick leave.  How much you pull down on a good night?
Max?  I'm Vincent.
Two...
I'm making <u>you</u> nervous.  I'm the one with a schedule.
I think so.
You don't understand.  I mean it. Really.  I'm not up for this...
Tens of thousands killed before sundown.  Nobody's killed that fast since Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Did you bat an eye, Max?  Join Amnesty International?  No.  I off one Angeleno, you throw a hissy fit...
Then don't let me get cornered, Max. You don't have the trunk space.
Good luck.  You think they got families?
Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
Jazz.  Music.
That's the point.  You play <u>between</u> the notes, you dance <u>around</u> the structure, you improvise.  Some people know where they're going to be ten years from now.  Same job, same neighbors, same shit over and over.  That's not living.  That's dying a little every day.  Not me, pal.  It's not knowing what's around the corner that makes like worth living.  That's jazz.  That guy up there, he knows what I'm talking about.  Hell, it's the same thing <u>he's</u> talking about, if you just open your ears.  You can hear it in the conversation he's having with that trumpet...
Jazz?  That's funny, coming from you.  Okay, some jazz for the jazz man. How's this?  I'll ask a question.
I'm done.  Find another cab.
Yeah?  Like what?  Limos?
I told you I don't like to talk about it.
Good excuse.  How many others you got?
No.  No way.  I can't do this.
We've both run out of options.  If it helps, take comfort in knowing you never had a choice.
What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
No, not just that.
Head towards Union Station.
You're too good.  We're in this together.  Fates intertwined.  Cosmic coincidence and all that crap...
As in...? 
I should have done that.  Fixed it and more.  Get out from under what I been under...
Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?
I live on tips, so don't be offended, but you're a liar.  I saw you kiss.  Admit it, this is the street where love lives.
The guy came right at us!
Drop me off here!
Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.
Sorry, Flip.  Got sidetracked.
You think I'm crazy.
Yes!  Don't let's get into this thing where I have to repeat myself!
Sure.  You switched the charts, didn't you?
Yeah.  I think so.
This would be it?
It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.
Not this again.
They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
Realized what?
Murdered?
It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool.  <u>In Newport</u>.
Don't do this to yourself.  Jerry. You don't love me.
John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.
Where were you the day he died?
Then tell me what happened.
Back where?
Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.
You think it's a conspiracy?
Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
Could you be a little more specific?
Lysergic acid diethylamide... With a little kicker of my own.  Surely it must be coming back to you by now?
I'm leaning toward no.
Only on the football field.
Terminal?
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
I don't believe you.
Working.
The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
This doesn't make sense.
It makes perfect sense.  Field work is not our oeuvre.
I was just thinking that.
No.  Not yet.
What do you suggest?
Still settling in, really.  Where's Dr. Arroway?
What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
No, thanks.
You can't just pull the plug, David.
It's not like you've given me much choice.
What?  Why?
You mean --
You were right, Ellie.  You were right all along.
Ellie.
I'm asking for your help, David.  I want to go.  They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist.  As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.
Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
This... seemed best.
Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you.
Yes -- of course -- all I'm saying is, this message was written in the language of science -- mathematics -- and was clearly intended to be received by scientists.  If it had been religious in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush, or a booming voice from the sky...
Put it on speakers.
We thought this might make things a little easier.
So we passed some kind of test?
If we don't engineer a consistent causality it'll work itself out on its own, and that's almost always worse.  Ellie, according to your physics none of this is possible.  A lot of it you're simply not capable of understanding, not yet.  No offense.
The powers that be have been quite busy lately, falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century, if not the millennium.  Perhaps you've noticed.  Perhaps I could help deal you back in.
You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
That's my girl.  Done.
Peter Valerian.
What if I said I could get Drumlin to agree to sell you time in New Mexico?
-- I'm moving to Washington.
But what about your research -- ?
Please, you're just as ambitious as I am, more --
Ellie --
I'm serious about this, Peter --
Ellie -- I'm getting married.  Her name's Laura.  She came up to Owens Valley to do her post-doc about six months after you left.
You sonofabitch.
Peter.
That you, Valerian?
Like it or not.
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?
How long was I gone?
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
Prove it.
Why?
What are you so afraid of, Ellie?
It's late.  We should go back.
I remember.  You were indelicate, indiscreet and entirely less than tactful... Sound like anyone you know?
I'm in love with you, Ellie.
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
I don't have any proof, Palmer.
I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
It's designed purely as a defensive device.  Call it a reasonable precaution.
Yeah. Well.  Gettin' up here, Boss.
Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
Oh lean over here, lady. Lean this way.
You steal a car?
Yeah. Did you have them both at once or --
I... I... I...
She's got him! You hear that?
Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
-- went down to see this old hag and she had needles the size of that cane.
You jes' watch us!
I got eyes, don't I? How my not gonna see something like that?
'Bout two hours left.
What happened? How far did you get?
A Lucas Jackson.
They ain't never seen a bull gang before.
Luke, you got to listen to me. All you got to do is just give up nice and quiet, just play it cool.
Like I always do?
He's the champeen hog-gut of this camp. Hell, I seen him eat ten choc'lat bars and seven cold drinks in fifteen minutes. He kin eat busted bottles and rusty nails, any damn thing. If you'd so kindly oblige as to let me cut off your yankee head, he'd even eat that.
One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything.
Come on, boy, come on, darlin'. You kin do her. Just let that ol' belly sag and enjoy itself. Stay loose, buddy. Eight more, between you and everlasting glory. Little ol' eggs, pigeon eggs, that's all, fish eggs practically.
Oh mah baby Luke.
I know he's got a paira kings. He don't have to stick 'em in my ear.
All the bears gonna be walking today.
Well, how far didya get?
That's all there was. Listen. Open your eyes. Stop beatin' it. And stop feedin' off me. Now get out of the way. Give me some air.
Fear of what...
I had the dream again.  And I got another call.  This time he spoke.  He said "You and me, you and me."
He whispered, but it was <u>him</u>!  I know it was him!
I know.  Do come and meet your guest.
You've got a date right <u>here</u>, Andy. This has got to...
But </u>alive</u>!
Oh, God, uniforms, more stress. Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark.  We know, don't we, Princess?  Give her a couple of hours.  I know about this.
Only part.  What else?  What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it.
You said, first, he was lying.  How do you know that, Doctor?
When was that?
Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the length of my arm...
You get me out first.
I don't have it...
Where is it?
Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...
Why did you do that?  Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far?  I worshipped you.  You inspired me.  I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.
You're calling me a crank?
<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.
Yes, I did.  Poor impulse control. The accounts of the firs two murders made it so clear they were the work of the same man, but you kept announcing they were unrelated.  You'll never catch him that way.
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
For months... last October.
It's too big a file to copy to a disk.
<u>He</u> won't.
I just came from her... here's what you haven't seen.
He's going home.  He slept over because I was a little anxious...
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping."  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it.
You're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style?  That doesn't happen.  These men are robotic; the murder is like a ritual.  The method itself is part of the pleasure...
Helen -- the killer directly contacted you.  His interest in you is <u>intense</u>.  I'm worried about you. I don't want to lose you.  I know this stirs up every monster under the bed, but this is the only direct contact we have with him. The only chance we have to trap him.  So, you can turn Internet back on, or I do, and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick, scream and hyperventilate.
Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him.  Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.  This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex.  He's playing a game with us.  Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame.  Just to prove he's better than all of them.  They got caught; he didn't.
What's that music.  It's Abba.  I can hear it.  It's Abba.
It's not chronological: Son of Sam was before Hillside.
Out.  Where does he go?  Nowhere. What does he do?  Nothing.
I've got to go.  I've <u>got</u> to go.
She on the passenger side?
<u>What</u>?...
Listen to me.  Is there a gas station nearby?
I know, baby.  I know.
They taught me at the FBI.  I was very good at it.  It scared me... I liked it.
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
Nada.  Lemme make the call.
Look at him, grandstanding...
Helen... excuse me, we...
What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
That's always your privilege, sir.
You ever reflect how this big explosion in dead women coincides with the flowering of women's lib?
If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic.
...confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern?  Do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city?
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
It's about time.
I wish I had. They bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months.
Do you find him attractive?
My last lesson's next week.  James... my car...
Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy.
And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?
You were the last one I saw just before the accident. Do you remember? We made love.
What about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology? I thought that was your project.
You're right, Ballard. There's an all- night car-wash in the airport service area.
We'll see about adjusting the dosage if that doesn't clear in the next  How are other things going?
Are you saying I'm through with therapy?
OK, good. That's good. Thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off.
Thanks so much for planning it, Letty. Jake's really looking forward to it.
Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
It'll be fine.
Do you want to go see him? I'll take you if you want to go.
Will you get time off to do that?
No, not yet. But you know Paul. He's sure to get it.
What about patterns? Do you find yourself checking and re-checking locks? Or washing your hands over and over again?
I had to sneak by the guards to get here. They say you're highly unstable, have a depressive personality, and may hold back my own recovery.
Break up?    They wish.
Lie down.
Michael, I...
It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
Do you like it?
Thanks.
Promise.  As long as we have steak.
The restaurant, too?
I didn't talk to her about medications, Michael. Don't be silly.
I think I should call someone.
Letty, please.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
Oh, God, Michael, I know.  Why does everything have to be so hard?
What do you want to do?
I love you too, Letty.     I love you, too.
In there's better.  It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
The receptionist said you called earlier about something.
Of course it will. Remember the big talent show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off.
I think you're overreacting.
So, I've been thinking a lot...
What?
Where are the tapes?
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If I do the tapes become evidence.
It's Daniel.
Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.
Yeah -- you do that.
He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
I assume you want something?
I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.
You have something for me?
What kind of business?
Why do I always have to answer the phone?
Jesus!
We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.
If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.
We had a deal.
What?
There's just one more thing I need you to do.
That's right. I said don't do it. Did you listen to me? No. You wanted the money. So, I lent you twenty large. Now it's been three weeks and you ain't paid a dime. What do you think that makes me look like on the street? I don't do something to you and everyone will think they can skate.
Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.
Yeah, French guys from France.
The Holiday Hotel.
You can use my car.
What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
That's brilliant! Care to elaborate?
She took everything!    Didn't even leave us cab fare.
It's my idea.
Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.
The baseball is mine.
They sort of got away.
You see that car?
No thank you.
Take a nap.
Something like that.
It looks old.     Did you get it a long time ago?
It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
I've been thinking about getting tattoo. You know, a flower or something. On my ass.
Stick around and find out.
How's the arm?  Still sore?
Don't bother.
You don't seem to understand.
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
You're a sword fighter too?
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
How so?
I'll write your name.  Just for fun.
Am I?  I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read.  Like you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm happy to be marrying.  But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness.
About you and Li Mu Bai?
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
You know about Lo?
He really loves you.  Come back to Peking with me.  We'll find a solution.
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
Let's end this here.
Only the sword will settle this.
And so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit.  He couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb.
It's time for me to leave it behind.
It was Bo, Sir Te's man.  I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.
She needs direction... and training.
She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us.  In any case, it will all be over soon.  You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.
I wish there were something more I could do to help you.
I heard Sir Te lost something.  And now Madame Te's not feeling well...
Yes.  The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master.  Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.
Sir Te!  It has brought him as much trouble as glory.  Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.
Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying.  Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.
No onions?
Don't thank me.
It's only fourteen or fifteen flesh wounds.
Leave here.  Don't do this.  I don't want you here.
You're bleeding, man.  You can't make it.
I lost my key.
She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair.
Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
Hey, I got my rocks off, so fuck you in the ass, man.
Wrong answer.
You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.
Like the car.  He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there.  Ask Top Dollar.
I took yours from you.  Your little girlfriend?  I took hers, too.  Your meaningless, petty life?  I took it so that tonight your existence might gain a purpose.  You're no avenger. You're mine.
Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
You work for the dead.  Forget that, and you can forget it all.
Go away.
Fine with me.
...necklace... pearls...
Yeah, I know, fatso.  Do us all a favor.  Make Top Dollar smile.
Mmm.  But tonight I can take what is his.
I'm sure you're going to love it there.
I'll be fine.
You heard me.
Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit.
Now it's my job to look out for you. You're like a kid sister to me. Do I look like some kind of gossip queen?
Junior.
Got a boyfriend back home?
I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
What'cha reading?
You implied it.
Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
Without question.
Alright.  I want you to leave and go back to New York.
If that's a problem, then I'll make arrangements to stay with some friends.
It's not about being happy. You and I can't -
Of Human Bondage.
Babe, you're looking at the next Mother Teresa.
You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady.
I did. We played three games of backgammon and...
No?
I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!
Well, I'm afraid you don't have a choice in the matter. You make me sick. You're a hypocrite and I don't associate with hypocrites.
Get off me.
Sure.
You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive.
Any ideas who it could be?
He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.
No problem. Just make sure your front door is unlocked. Shall we say the "stroke of midnight" no pun intended?
Cecile, is that the best you can do?  You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before.
Okay.
Really? Bulimic headcase.
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
Eww. No. That's gross.
Did you hide the letters?
Of course I would. We're friends, right?
I... I don't think you want to know.
Why didn't you do something?
That's one way of looking at it.
You think he'll like it?
My mom? Don't call my mom.
Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help.
Yummy.
Honey, is something wrong?
Yes.
Yes!
What do you mean?
I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
What?
In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.
I see your point... though why should I care?
Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory.
Loser.
Interesting.
Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.
Have you succeeded in your task?
Any day now.
Well, let me know when you do. Until then.
I'm aware.
What's your problem?
With who?
Exactly the opposite.
A momentary lapse of judgment, soon to be rectified.
She wouldn't say. She apologized to your aunt and told her she was going to stay with some friends.  You blew it, Sebastian. That girl has come to her senses and she will never go near you again.
Kind of.
And I don't.
P-whipped, p-whipped.
Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
I've never done this before.
You wanted an answer to your question.
Come again?
And if I don't?
I know. She's so young and he's so -
I did?
How will I get to her?
Did you hit her?
It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.
I can make wishes like this come true.  I'll be just like Daddy wants me to be -- play with the other children -- not sit around by myself  tell the truth --
Did you ever make a wish?
I made a wish today, and it came true just like Edward said it would.
On the back street  a green house
No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
You can't open it yet. You have to put all of them under the tree until morning.
Darling, no father could be nicer to a child than you are to Amy.
Well, you know where it is.
Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
That darn kid. I never in my life expected her to get an A in arithmetic. Math's is a practical science --- if she understands figures, she's well out of her own world of make-believe.
No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
Yes, daddy.
Daddy, it's true.
And this one's for Mrs. Farren.
But there's no one here, darling.
She's upstairs.. .the lady who lives up there.
I'm your friend.
Will you be friend for always?
I'll just never learn arithmetic.
Pretend, darling.  It's All Soul's Eve.  Round about the fire we go...  Over the flames we leapt
My dolls. We can pretend.
Yes, winter's coming.  I don't like the winter,
You wanted to share this moment with me.
But, Amy!  Amy...I'm dead.
I wouldn't be surprised if it were a true wishing ring.
the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
But she's such a nice lady.
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
Do you know the story of "The Headless Horseman?"
Good.
My daughter died long ago.
If that child comes here...if I find her trying to steal your love from me...I'll kill her. Yes, I'll kill her:
Come away, Amy.
That's from her -- that woman.
I like to see her happy.
But don't you see...it's just what I was about to say to Alice...Amy in her own mind may not be lying.
Perhaps she's wanted for understanding.
I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
Looks like a helluva lot more than a make-over. Was there surgery involved?
I've changed a lot lately.
Never felt better.
Oh, on my wrist.
It's not just in my head.
I get crazy dreams and I black out.
He's a very talented musician.
Every woman at some point has to date a musician. I wish you'd get rid of Mark for good. Every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out.
Sorry. It's just so bad lately. You're so lucky you never get PMS.
Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.
Even on sale that stuff's a fortune. I worked all week to pay for a bra.
They better. Of course, trouble is, you never know what they'll expect for it. You gotta know what to order, and what you're willing to do. Like if a guy spends a fortune on you, he's gonna feel like you owe him something.
Did I kill him? Of course not!
Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
I don't know much about him. How do you know if a guy is decent?
What the hell is the tampon test?
You're at his place, and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say, "I'm so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons?" If he says no, he's too embarrassed, then you know he's a wus. If he says he's got some in the bathroom, then you know there are other women around a lot. But if he says yes and goes to get you tampons, well then he's a decent guy. Then, while he's out...
I look like fuckin' Chewbacca.
Frida? I was worried to death about you. I've called you for two days. Where have you been?
Frida, Carlton's dead.
And he was missing an arm.
What? Why'd you do that?
Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.
Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years.
Sure. See ya.
Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?
I didn't have to pee then.
You don't have to pee.
Yes I do have to pee!
Frida, you know you're it for me.
It's Mark.
Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me.
At least let me give you this back. I washed it.
That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.
No, she died when I was twelve.
The weird thing is I've had an odd, morbid fascination with wolves ever since.
Like what?
Yeah. Maybe.
Goodnight.
Okay, you busted me.
Uh... the buzzer's broken. I'll be down in a second.
I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
I love you too.
They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
You know, I've never seen your cat.
No, it's a good thing. I like it. Everything about you is great. I like how you don't shave your legs. Women are so much sexier when they're natural.
You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
I knew you wouldn't believe me! Just go away. Go very far away!
I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
He's been running money for the Mafia.
Hey, there was a lot of blood.
And you think I'm sick?
And he was missing an arm.
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
What makes her think that?
She says she's on the rag every time I get called in to investigate a murder.
Thanks.  Just some pills.
What of?
Shut up!  Everybody stay calm...
Loose ends?
You are mistaken.
Just like that?
Ill be the judge of that.  Anything else?
What makes you think that!  If you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked  -  you might get things done faster, Bumstead...
Good.
You wont regret this, sir.
Well be more careful, please.
Not that.  Anything else.
A few days...  a few weeks  -  dunno, I can't remember.  Worse thing is, I never know if it will change back again...  Now, please leave me alone.
I see.  The verdict, yes...
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
Yes.
Tell me about them...
Anything <u>but</u>, my friend.
Maybe.
I'm...  being...  punished.
Is this dangerous or anything?
Don't worry.  You won't even see her.
... Alright.
Lots of shelters were in this bill.
You're lint!  You're a flea!  You're a blip!
Nightmare...
Don't call the Vice President!
... What?
Just don't call him, Alan!
This is mine, Al -- all mine ... I made him. I built him.  And no cocksucker is gonna come in here and take it away from me just because he to be Vice President of the United States!
Fine.
You think we can keep this thing going for a couple of months!
You can't kill a President.
Oh. Okay.  I'll catch ya tomorrow then.
I just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be.
At a press conference.
Right.  We can pick up on the rest tomorrow.
We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.
And these are a gift from the King of To go.
What do you mean?
Certainly.
`Bleed for your king.'
That's okay.  You alright down here by yourself?
Go tuck yourself, Bill.
What's wrong with a magic trick?
I'm sure they did.  'State of Emergency.'  'National Security.' You ever hear of the Constitution?
I'm not the First Lady, anymore.  I shouldn't be here.
He wasn't always like that, anyway.
I guess.
Yeah... Bedtime.
Looks like we're not going to get a chance to get much done.
... Not exactly the Oval Office.
We're doing our best, sir.
It better be.   Last time you had me introduce a dead guy.
Quiet!
SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!
I know you can. Like I said, we been watchin' you.
How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two.
What is it if it ain't a curse?
What?
One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.
God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?
If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
MARY!
No time for that. I'll take care of them.
Say Steve, where's your manners?  Here's Mutt's brother and you don't offer him a drink? Want some bourbon?
Actually I don't really know Mutt.
You know how many demerits we're talking?
They're townies?!
But why?
Hey, this is great.
Needs Chris!  Must have Chris!
Knox, you gotta calm down.
And English, and trig
Don't you think they'll figure out who did it?!  Don't you know they'll come to you and demand to know what the Dead Poets Society is?   Charlie, you had no right to do something like that!
Isn't he precious?
Miss it?  It drives us crazy.  That's part of what this club is about.  In fact, I'd like to announce that I've published an article in the school paper, in the name of the Dead Poets society, demanding girls be admitted to Welton, so we can all stop beating off.
And are we just playing around out here or do we mean what we say?  If all we do is come and read a bunch of poems to each other, what the hell are we doing?
I think you're sweet.
I'm not?
Your family move into that new house, Mr. Overstreet?
Mr. Dalton, if you think you're the first to try to get thrown out of this school, think again.  Others have had similar actions and they have failed just as surely as you will fail.  Bend over and grab your shins.
Sure, but Cameron asked me too.  Anybody mind including him?
All right.  I'll second that.
They were walking along the fence past the soccer field.  Said they were curious about the school so I invited them to the meeting.
Maybe he'll have some advice.  Maybe he'll even talk to your father.
Nice meeting you, Knox.  Bye, Gin.
The pleasure is mine.
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
Knox!  what are you doing here?
Oh, but it's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me?
Precisely, Meeks. Greek for the herd. However, be warned that, when you say "the hoi polloi" you are actually saying the the herd.  Indicating that you too are "hoi polloi."
A barbaric yawp.
A madman.  Perhaps he was.  What kind of madman?  Don't think!  Answer.
Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him.  You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do.  If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want.
Yeah.
Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
I don't know.
Father, I wasn't disputing you.
Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.
Nobody-  I thought I'd surprise you. I've got all As and-
I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  Is that clear?  Is that clear!
Yes sir.
But different.
Where is this cave he's talking about?
Nothing.
Thanks but  I'd better do history.
What?
I know that.  What's it got to do with you?
Hell no, but that's not the point.  The point is for the first time in my whole goddamned life, I know what I want, and for the first time I'm gonna do it whether my father wants me to or not! Carpe diem, goddamn it!
Er  No.
I will be with thee straight.
Yes.
Someone...maybe they sent an SOS!
Take note Mr. Mason...this is why you hire a professional...No whining. No excuses.
How soon can we get up and running?
And she could do a hell of a barbie to boot! Belt up. You'll find all the parts you need up there.
He's with them.
You hear that?
I'm not rich people.
That's what I do.
With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?
You should talk...
Not like him.
Jet ski...there's one left up there.
I don't know...you got what we need?
That way.
Seafood salad.  You ever operate a jet ski?
You mean countries that are acknowledged by the UN...or like made up countires too?
Like Mamooli's country...
'Cause grease monkey ain't in my job description dick head...
What happened to Vivo?! What the hell happened to Vivo?
Damn right!
Gimme a Hostess Twinkie, Merle.
What do you think, Sal? Jesus, you think we'd miss this?
They did not!
Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
In case???!!! In case of what? In case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall?!
Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you been doin', I mean...
Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way.
No.
You are frightened, no?
No. None of that.
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
You call me Linda, just like home.
Get anything?
Merle? That's who we're looking for. Merle.
Yeah?
Now he's back.
Oh well! What do you mean Oh well?! The guy is actually... He did it again! That's what he's doing... He... He's reaching in, John, to her --! I'll kill him! I'm gonna kill him right now.
Who's got the ammo?
Psst. Vince!
That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret.
Will you marry me?
What kind of beer would you like?
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --
You're going hunting?
C'mon. I've got the car.
Up north.
Yeah.
Yeah.
From Nam?
Promise! You gotta promise!
Tomorrow I go with Vince.
What do you think?
We what?
When you get the AK, open up. You got me? Open up.
YOU'RE CRAZY!!!... NO WAY!... NOW YOU'RE CRAZY!!! YOU'RE COMPLETELY CRAZY!!!
I'll betcha! That's bullshit and I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!
Here! This is it!
Listen, Nick --
You didn't get a deer?
Phantom Mary?
Well... Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird... You want to hear the whole story?
It's all right. Hey, it's all right. We'll be right here, right with you.
Same old thing. Hey, same like always. Nothing's changed. Albert is getting fat.
Oh, Jesus!  You're kiddin'!
Yeah.
The fuck I did!!!
Down.
Down ribbon!
Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
I want this bastard brought down.
Mom, I hate to break this to you, but there's a whole other species out there you're neglecting.  If you've forgotten, they're called 'men'.  Sometimes referred to in more colorful language.
Fuck you - fuck you.
Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
I'm not voting for you.
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
I was part of the escort team that re-animated him.  My partner's dead because of this guy.
But sir, Sergeant Wade saved the hostages.
I'm thrilled beyond belief.
Go in the house.
Not the 'T' word.
Officer Hector Sanchez, Sergeant. Hillside Academy.  Status G-8. Security Clearance 3.  One year Advance Technical Crime Analyst. Weapons Assistant.  FDA Junior Captain, Hollywood division---
Yes.
I'm ready.
Whoa.  Don't touch that.  <u>Pursuit</u> <u>Mode</u>.  Auto pilot.  Computerized steering and driving system used in high speed pursuits.  Installed Fall 2006.  Underground rumor has it they modeled it after you, sir.
How do you know?
There's no time.  There are civilians in there.  It's about to go down.
Relax, let technology do the work.
Simulated one.
I'm here.
I'm signing off.
What's your name?
Good to know you, Willy.
Remember, get the seat fixed.
It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.
I've brought you something to keep you warm, Mrs. Stone --
A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?
And what about Daniel Webster?
Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West.
Daniel give me that beanshooter!
I see you! Riding pretty high, ain't you? Look out you don't fall off.
Some other time, Stevens.
Afraid ... of what?
But what becomes of our souls?
Stevens -- what's all this leading up to? You know something. Come on! Out with it -- you know something about me!
Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right. But--
Yes, why shouldn't it?
Suddenly you seem quite desperate, Mr. Stone --  -- You know I'm a good-natured man. I'm always open to reason. With a little security -- I might--
No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now.
Ten throws it is.
Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this --
Yes -- at midnight.
I know -- that was mighty queer Medford -- knew it the minute I tasted it. But it takes more than that to down Daniel Webster.
Come right into the parlor, won't you, folks.
Well? Don't a politician have to be?
You are not so sure that he'll come.
Shake!
Coming.
It's Tom Sharp and two other fellers -- Oh, glory -- where's my pants?
You're right, Mary it's a fine calf. That's why Stevens'll take it for the rest of the payment.
Mary -- how do you feel?
No, Jabez -- all I need is some rest -- You go and pay our debt. Everything'll be all right then ... everything.
Looks right elegant, Mary.
Yes, Mary.  It's been a long day.
There is nothing to worry about now.
Don't take cold, Jabez.  Come -- it's warm in here.
Oh -- Jabez.
And I don't want to have a washwoman for a wife.
It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all.
What's the matter with 'em? Why don't they come?
Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell.  Don't seem right, somehow!
Say, Mary, how is your shoulder?
I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son.
A man can always change things, Son. That's what makes him different from barnyard critters.
Fiddlesticks! She don't hear it. Got better music to listen to than that.  There -- that's what I mean.
Gone with Daniel Webster -- to Marshfield, son.... You told Mary to go--
The law is the law. Good-bye, Mary.
You aren't angry with me?
Oh -- it's you again. What do you want?
With the presidential election coming up, I thought I could be of some help, sir.
Me?
Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say?
Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client.
I object.
That isn't it. It's ... the loneliness, Mr. Scratch ... the loneliness!
Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to help me, man.  This is my first time driving a limo.
It's corny, but I could live with it.
The police...?
What are you going to do?
I told them we're old friends and you were my guest at the party.
That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him!  I hate his fucking guts --  -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me --
This is what this is about?  Out building project in Indonesia? Contrary to what you people think, we're going to develop that region... not 'exploit' it.
Who said we were terrorists?
It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open!
I'm a cop from New York.
William Clay.  Call me Bill.
One weekend I went to a combat ranch...  You know, that game with the, the guns that shoot red paint?  Must sound pretty silly to you...
That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.
Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands.
Oh?  What idiot put you in charge?
That's okay...  ... I have an eye on his private bathroom.
Oh, here it comes.  One of those 'meaningful relationship conversations.' I never should've let you get those magazine subscriptions --
Yeah.  How'd you know?
In my youth, partner.  In my youth.
I still feel like shit.
Then who the hell have you been talking too?
We don't exactly know, Sir.  He won't give us him name.  He appears to be the man who called in the report...he's killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others.
How do you know?
What's it look like?  We're going in.
They jet's comin' out.  But don't let 'em off the ground.
Heidi, for Christ sake, shut up! Will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?!
See?  You're screaming with the language and all!  A person can't communicate with you.  You become a stranger in your own home...
Don't call yourself fat.
Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna get shot or whatever.  You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear.
It's too late - just get away from me - don't talk to me now - go over to your place...
I love you.
Yeah... obviously you don't... when you put a gun to somebody's head... and you say go to sleep so that it won't hurt when I pull the trigger. Death?  Don't talk about death to me.  I have been living with death for the last six months.  Why do you think I'm in the hospital?  I take a handful of pills to get away from you.  And then here I am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone... again.  I have no friends left.  No job.  I can't live.  I have to live with people. This death business... I'm sorry!
Why you going to Algeria?
Denmark?  Sweden?
I like that... yeah!
I know I am.  I know!
Sonny, would you please just tell them... please...
I don't know what to say to ya!  I guess I just wanted to say I'll see ya... or whatever.
Well, you got to get hold of yourself.  You got to talk to him, tell him to give himself up.
He's got eight people in there with him.  He's got this kid with him ... they're gonna shoot the people.
You're in it up to your ass, Leon. You're an accessory.  You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case.
How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?
When I'm bein' fucked, I like to be kissed a lot.  Who the fuck are you tryin' to con me into some deal?  You're a city cop, where's the FBI?  This is a federal offense, I got kidnapping, armed robbery, they're gonna bury me!  You know it, you can't talk for them, you're some flunky pig tryin' to bullshit me.  Now God damn it, get somebody in charge here to talk to me!
I swear to God I had nothing to do with it ...
I'm not ... I'm not ... you're gettin' a bus ... you're gettin' a bus ... the jet's comin' into Kennedy ... and your wife's on the way ... what else do you need? What else can I get you?  Listen, I don't know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the FBI guy ...
Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
Okay ...
Gimme the keys to get outta here!
If you take anybody, please take me.
I don't fool around with you.
I don't know, Sonny ... on the roof somewhere I guess.
You like me?
Why not?
I want to dictate my will.  I need a notary?
It's okay. [Regards to the family, Sam.]
Howard!
Did you always call him Junior.
No, that's all.
Because I don't want cancer.
Pure?
Yeah - it's all right... let's go.
What?
But do you mean it?
Are you serious?  About throwin' a body outta here if we have to?
Does that still go?
It's nothing - it just goes up - it's the safest thing in the world. Safer than a car.  Don't worry about it, Sal - it'll be all right ... they're great ...
They keep sayin' two homosexuals. I'm not a homosexual.  I want you to stop them saying that.
Oh, Jesus!  Hey.  How about food? I forgot to ask to have food on board.
Nothin' personal, huh?  The man that kills me, I want him to do it because he hates my guts.  Not because it's a job.  Okay, let's go ... but you gotta walk in backwards.
I just want to see all you young ladies are all all right in here.
Okay.  Which one goes?
What's the matter... they never housebroke you?
... Just give me time to think...
Goodbye, honey.  Wish us luck!
Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this.  I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...
Oh my God!  I don't understand.  If you needed money, why couldn't you come to me?  Everything I got is yours.  I got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings.  It's yours.  You know it.
She doesn't have anything to do with it!  You understand that? Mother?  This is me!
I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
I can't, Mom.  If I come out Sal will kill them.
Maybe!  Aw Christ, what dreams you live on!  Maybe what?
I'm here to talk to you, Sonny, not ...
I don't want to be paid.  I'm here with Sal and eight other people ... and we're dyin'!  They're gonna blow our guts out, man!  You're gonna see our brains onna sidewalk! How's that for all you shut-ins and housewives to look at!  You gonna help, or you just put it on instead of AS THE WORLD TURNS?  We're dyin' here!  What have you got for me?
You could give up.

In theory.
I'm trying to organize a boycott of Sal's pizza joint.  Ya see what I'm saying?
We shouldn't buy a single slice, spend a single penny in that motherfucker till some people of color are put up in there.
You got my back.
My brother.
My brother.
Who told you to step on my sneakers? Who told you to walk on my side of the block?  Who told you to be in my neighborhood?
Who told you to buy a brownstone on my block, in my neighborhood on my side of the street?
Have you noticed something about them?
So, in other words, you are not down.
You come in here at least three times a day.  You a retard?  A buck fifty.
You a troublemaker?
What?
A motherfucking year off the motherfucking boat and got a good business in our neighborhood occupying a building that had been boarded up for longer than I care to remember and I've been here a long time.
Too long!  Too long.  Now for the life of me, I haven't been able to figger this out.  Either dem Koreans are geniuses or we Blacks are dumb.
I just wanted to know who named ya Sweet Dick Willie?
Gotta go.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
Good!  Leave me alone when I'm sleeping.  I'm gonna get a lock on my door, to keep ya ass outta here.
I'm in here.
I just come home to take a quick shower.
Later for Sal.  Y'know, sometimes I think you're more concerned with him than me.
Don't worry 'bout me.  I always get paid.
Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.
I didn't stutter.  Take care of your responsibilities.  Y'know exactly what I'm talking about.
I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.
Talk to your son.
Run it then.
Sal, just do me a favor, leave Jade alone.
You're right, a kid is dead, but Mook, this isn't the time.
You gonna open up another Sal's Famous Pizzeria?
Bring some ice cream, I'm burning up.  Do you love me?
I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.
Yes, yes, Lord.  Isn't this better than Haagen-Dazs butter pecan ice cream?
Tina, it's not like that.
I am a man.
And not Larry Bird?  Who's your favorite movie star?
How do you know this?
Since when do you know what's best for us?
So what if this is a Black neighborhood, so what if we're a minority.  I've never had no trouble with dese people, don't want none either, so don't start none.  This is America.  Sal's Famous Pizzeria is here for good. You think you know it all?  Well, you don't.  I'm your father, you better remember that.
Whaddup?
Don't start on me today.
Yeah, you are. He touched you. You're "it" until you touch someone else.
She's saying... a beautiful swan...
I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
Heddo Jeth-ica.
Yeah...
I'm fine.
Just down the hall.
Of course, she's in on it too. Don't let her see you. Just go get that chest and show the world what Collins has been doing. I'm staying here.
Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...
Is it okay if he spends the night?
No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
I haven't seen you around here before.
Me too!
How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
Me too!
The principal.
And nobody will make fun of your horrible deformity.
Who's Captain Rob?
Peg leg?
No.
Okay. Anyone else have any questions?
Don't look directly at him.
Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
HARRY, I said don't 'dress like a Queen'!
Our own special bus.
Who's your partner?
Some what?
But-
JESSICA and I are through. I couldn't stand being with her knowing you liked her. It wasn't worth our friendship. Oh, and she also has a boyfriend.
Captain Rob came back?
Sorry, no further questions.
It was a diamond and you swallowed it.
Right. She's so proud of her boyfriend.
Put a fork in me Harry, lets get started.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is a greater American than George Washington will ever be.
That's gross.
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
Dietician! This interview is over. You can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads off.
That's not your tape.
You're just jealous.
Oh Harry's doing just fine, he's just about to open up.
This is so embarrassing, it's never happened before. Well, maybe a couple of times, but I was alone.
Skateboard.
He passed away three years ago.
Well he missed a great pot of stew!
Class, please study on your own. There seems to be a family emergency because there's no other reason why my father would interrupt me WHILE I'M WORKING!
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
Loser... oh yeah he was a loser alright. A big loser.
How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
Well I've got a little surprise for you.
Monkey, this is too exciting! I can't believe our dream is coming true.
The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.
Basically...
My Lord?
Let him stand free!
Paul... please, Paul... listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you.
The spice!  It's in everything here.  The air, the soil, the food...  It's like the Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me.  But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness.  I can see it... I can see it.
I can't... I can't.
I know the secret.  The worm is the spice... the spice is the worm.
Long live the fighters!
Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
What can be done has been done.
Uh, Greetings.  I am the Count...
I don't want anything.  I'm just a really big, big fan.  I've seen all your movies.
Take my word for it.  You want to "score" with a young lady, you take her to see "Dracula."
Well, It's about how people have two personalities.  The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside.
Yeah.  You pull the strings --  "Pull the strings"... hey, that's pretty good!
Uh, Eddie, do you have my money?
We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
"Oh, tract housing, huh?"  Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."
Stop worrying.  This is going to raise your spirits.
This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
Perfect.
Has anyone ever been to Downey?
Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
I know none of <u>my</u> wives would've.
No problem.  I know it by heart...
No, it's fine.  It's real!  In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day.
Isn't he?
The ghost can be barefoot.  <u>Give</u> <u>me your shoes</u>!
You met Basil Rathbone!
Well, I'd really like to know what you think.  Why don't you go in the bedroom and take a look at it?  I'll Wait...
Since I was a kid.  My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.  It just kinda became a habit.
But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job.
Don't get angry at me.  Maybe you just need a day job.
None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life.
Perhaps a small amount of money.  How much do one of your motion pictures cost?
Oh, of course!!  There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!
The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.
Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.
Doctor Acula?  I don't get it.
Hruphh...?
Would that work?
Yes?
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
Yes?
Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.
Isn't he dead?
So change the poster.  Trust me, you'll be better off.  This is a story that's gonna <u>grab</u> people.  It's about this guy.  He's crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses.  Should he tell her? Should he not tell her?  He's torn. George, this is DRAMA.
Yeah?  Whatever.  So did you like it?
He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?
No! I love sex with girls.
Bela died.
Uh, atomic energy?
Dynamite --
No, BIGGER!  What's the biggest energy??
Yes!  BINGO!  Solar energy!  Oh that's gonna seem so scientific.  This movie's gonna be the ultimate Ed Wood film.  <u>No compromises</u>.
My chiropractor!
So?  It's only a five-hour drive. And it'll probably clear up, once we hit the desert.  Heck, it'll probably clear up once we drive around the corner.  I promise.
No.  I think my film is perfect for you.
No!  I don't want you to show the movie, I want you to be <u>in it</u>!  See, maybe I should explain: We started shooting, but then after three days we got shut down.  So we're having a backers party, to raise some more money.  Perhaps you'd like to come next door and meet some of the backers...?
Exactly.  Hey, how 'bout this -- what if I don't have any lines?  I'll do the part mute!
LOOK AT HIS SKULL!
Hey, don't blame me!  You didn't say anything about no motor when I was up on that ceiling!
Mr. Wood!
Doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid?
Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?
Do they show it?
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
Yeah, so... ?
Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al.
I'm not -- I didn't -- Al, you know how I feel about you...
Well, now I will. He was a crazy mean, son-of-a-bitch.
Al!
What?!
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
So?
Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
Okay, so you understand? We're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, plus, of course, there'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you.
Could we just talk alone for a second? I --
You said a woman likes to be pursued.
Ed --
Just wait here. She's coming right back out.
Al!
So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
So he killed himself.
Yeah?
Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --
No. It's a mess.
No! I -- All right, look, if you hear from Ray.... tell him to call me, okay?
I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"...
You and Al lived together a few months before you got married -- after Dad left.
Holy sh--
Who?
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him --
The doctor said you were having sex.
But Al is your husband now!
Apparently, neither can Hank. What the hell did you do to him?
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
I'm a whore!  Your bathrooms are filthy!
Shari, Ray feels --
She left.
I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?
Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
I hear the dog really liked him.
Oh, the whole family loved him. Of course, they loved the last guy I went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me.
Right.
Shari, I'm just really sorry. Look, I know this is... unbelievably awkward, but if I could come in for like a second and -- you know -- just say... two words, then...
I'm not. I'm not. I'm just Look -- you know, in a way, it's good. He got this out of his system now and he knows it's not worth it and, you know, someday if you guys got married or something --
Okay ...
Yeah. I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do?
Really?
Saturday, I think we should
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
Shari...
No. Who?
Look at this.
Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care.  Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other... 
So?
So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.
I'm sorry.
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business.
What?
Yeah.
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
Richie!  She spent six months dating a criminal
"Quick pull off the highway" is not a relationship. Oh man, I gotta pee.
It's the receptionist at one of the places I service video equipment -- she's very pretty and, you know, she never even talks to me and then today I come in and she's all "I saw you on TV the other night... You were so great ... " Next thing I know we're ...
Me?! That's you!
Hi, Shari.
The whole time? Eighteen years?
No. Two times.
Check forging.
That Ray was a pig. Ed is doll. You latch on to him honey.
She's incredible.  Everything just gets soaked.
He likes it.
Dick.
See, it doesn't add up. There are only 801 ballots but 803 people voted. Two votes are missing. Check the register.
Here they are.
Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.
Okay, fine. Sure
Should be easy.  So far no competition.
Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.
Looks like Tim Kobza.
Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it?  Whom should we "interrogate?"
Looks like today's your lucky day
Oh.  New cars.  I see.  Well, you came to the right place
Nooo.  I just thought...  l mean, I am looking for a new car.  But I just thought, well, I'm going away soon, and you'll be stuck here and, I don't know, I just think maybe if things had been different we might have been, well, friends. Real friends.  And then things would be different.  Don't you think?
Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you?
You sure?
Should we get a what?
points at the motel.
Oh.
We'll let it run awhile
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
I'm telling you. Dr. Hendricks, every vote was accounted for.
Yeah.
Thanks.  You too.  It was great working with you.
What's it to you?
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
Are you sorry she's dead?
No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
Tell me about Patchett.
Miss Bracken, don't ever try to fucking bribe me or threaten me or I'll have you and Patchett in shit up to your ears.
Yeah.
He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
No.  I'm really a brunette, but the rest is me.  And that's all the news that's fit to print.
Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
So you saved her.
Yeah.  But not for long.
This business, Captain?
How what, Wendell?
Let my daughter rest in peace.
First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died.
The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
Dudley's guys.
<u>Lynn</u>.
What about him?
If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  They just won't come on the bus, that's all.
Against your code?
I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  She is -- was -- a big doubles fan.
And you fuck people up for a living.  That don't make me you. <u>Capisce</u>, shitbird?
His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared.
He's under a tract house in San Berdoo.  And he don't smell too good.  What happened to the heroin, Johnny?
It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
More or less.
So on active duty, Meeks didn't make an arrest from 1938 to '43.
Believed what?
Man, why're you talkin' about Larry?  His business is his business.
Some ferstunkener is moving in and we don't know who?!  Maybe we should ask Hedda Hopper!
But you were business associates?
And?
He runs call girls.  Primo tail. Fixed up like movie stars.
Answer yes or no.
Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance --
Anonymous.  Probably nothing.
Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland.
I think you'll be surprised what Edmund's capable of.
What's this all about, lad?
<u>Throwing me</u>?
Just don't shoot me.
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
Movie star hookers.  Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.
She <u>is</u> Lana Turner.
With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.
Yeah.  The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away.
Why do men and women usually see each other?
Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.
Do you have any proof?
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
Something good?
Give me some Narco skinny.  I want to put out an all hop-head issue. Shvartze jazz musicians and movie stars.  Maybe tie it into the Rosenbergs.  You like?
He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
Jesus.  Jack, that's a story. 'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.' Let me get my camera.
Yeah.  Me neither.
Yes.
Maybe you bumped into someone who took it and you didn't even know.
Who are you calling?!
Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.
I'll come straight there.
I don't know who he is.
Told by whom?
230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.
I don't know what that--
What if--
And you won't. Now move--
I'll pay you.
We said a hundred.
I called my wife!
What'd I tell you?
Oh, I'll bet <u>that</u> threw 'em off the scent. I sure hope you covered the mouthpiece with a handkerchief and used a funny voice!
You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
How'd you get around the tap orders?
Well...there'd be too much disclosure to prosecute me. So they ruined my records and made sure I'd never hold a real job again.
What's going on?
Who?
You're driving.
Tell me about it.
I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.
It'd never get through. All packages are screened, x-rayed and then hand-searched for explosives. You didn't like my "give-me-my- money" idea?
What if--
No.
It's Pat Cary. I work for Senator Sam Albert and I was given Jerry's name.
What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
Law enforcement?
Are you sure about this?
You got any money?
Yes. I have her permission.
It's okay. I think it's a wonderful gift.
I'll be right back.
For that matter, I think you will too.
Hey, did you guys find my stuff?
That's 'cause I <u>wasn't</u> there.
Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.
Than why don't you talk to the bus driver?
No.
Just for the criminals.
What?
A toaster. And no terrorist talk at dinner. You're spookin' the kids.
How'd you get the information on DePinto?
It's okay.
Stacy--
Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
This is science-fiction Robert! The manager showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it.
What happened to your head?
That was for Christmas.
I was missing you.
It's over.
You did good.
Maybe it's not connected yet.
Here, you can use this.
Don't count on it.
This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
DePinto?
That wasn't the answer I was hoping for.
Other than Brill.
He doesn't work that way.
How?
What makes you think it's you?
My guess is male, somewhere in his 40's or 50's.
We'd rather not--
And may I ask what could possibly be more important than Fawell Oil v. U.S. Environmental Agency?
L.T., in this office I'd prefer you say Italian-Americans.
She doesn't want to talk to you.
Are those my Christmas presents?
Some of 'em.
Sure, go ahead.
Dad!
What?
That's what I want to talk to you about?
Ssh!
Yes.
No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
So do I!
Yeah?
Jerry?
Bobby--
Yeah.
I'm just doing some Christmas shopping. It's for my wife, no kidding. Though, this isn't the <i>main</i> present, it's just, you know, a little--
No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan?
Then what's your goddam opinion?
You're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? <i>Terrorism,</i> you unconscionable asshole?
There are planes falling out of the sky, buildings blowing up. <i>American</i> buildings. <i>Americans</i> getting bombs in the mail. What are we gonna do!?
The originals?
Get it.
It was in his bag. Now it's not.
If they've looked at the video.
Federal Express?
For Daniel Zavitz. I just need a signature.
Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
You felt obliged to.
A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.
Look over there.
Shall we be all right?
Fiction.  We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on.  More.
All true.  Herodotus, your friend, tells of a wind - the Simoon - so evil that a nation declared war on it and marched out to fight it in full battle dress, their swords raised.
Good.
Yes.  A different wife.
Shall we be all right?
Dance with me.  I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me.
You speak so many bloody languages and you never want to talk.
Thank you.  Will you bury Geoffrey?  I know he's dead.
There you have me.
All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
Very well.
Why are you people so threatened by a woman?!
No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle?  I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and  Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk.
What?
Her hands and feet were tied.
Cut the ropes.  I left a note, on his blanket.  At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot.  The Girl wouldn't leave, of course.  Her father had sold her for a camel. He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.
I told you so.
Thank you.
I don't know.
We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.
Oh Jesus.  Oh Jesus Christ.
What do you want?
I'm okay.  Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other.  I can shoot a pistol!  I'll sleep in the stables.  I don't care where I sleep.  I don't sleep.
Who are his ghosts?
Ask him.
Ask him.  Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
No-one should own music.  The real question is who wrote the song?
Are you planning to be the exception?
Me?  You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy.  So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.
First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
We shall miss you.
Sweltering.  Come on, I'll take you home.
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
Candaules
Because I'm a nurse.
Why?  Can he lay eggs?
Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
Do I recognize him?  I recognize what he is. I like him.  He's Canadian.  He can read Italian.  He can catch rabbits.
Kip's another one.
I don't think it does.  Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
Hey! -
The mines, the wires, there's a trick. Some explode if you stretch the wires, some if you cut them.
Okay.  Get away from here.  Quick.
I'm not scared.  So many people have died around me.  But I would be a shame for us.  I don't feel like being shy.
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
Nya-nya-nya!
Of course.  When?
I mean home.  India.
If anything happened to you I'd never forgive myself.
I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
Don't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL! Hana stops. 
I looked up to you, Uncle.  My brother always said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them.
No.
You tell me.  I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France.
This was your garden?
Bingo.
He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
Let a thousand flowers bloom. Chairman Mao.
Exactly.
You got a better idea?
I don't know, but close.
In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him?
Who am I?
It's sold.
How about if you try disappearing.
I don't want to waste your time.
It's nothing serious. I'll just run into that building. They'll have some sort of first aid kit.
Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says.
Oh, I'm taking you...quite seriously.
So what?
So you've heard all those stories about me. Well, I can assure you they're not true. And if they were true, I've retired.
Got it.
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
What's my problem? You want a list?
You really don't believe I'd take on a partner after all these years without a little...insurance?
It is.  Coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. We'll start in twenty minutes.
We're doing this together. We're partners.
This isn't some Picasso print you steal out of a car dealer's rec room.
You're too easily impressed with yourself. I believe I've made that point before.
No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
Straight down the drive, right at the hedgerow, follow the lane. Don't blink, you'll miss it.
Little celebration before we set off.
In eye of that painting.
Let's mingle a little, shall we?
You're not on the beat.
It's your mistake.
My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
Hold the record. Alone.
I told you. It's the down payment. And thanks to you it's overdue.
There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.
You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade.
Would you quiet down! Just for a minute?
I'd taken the Mask?
We're doing it tonight.
Two men in the world don't need passwords or codes. Their retinas will scan to unlock everything. one of those two men is the chairman of the bank.
Let me guess. His retinal plate is in there.
A flaw in your research, my dear. I grew up chewing shoe leather for breakfast.
You mean the seven billion.
Tina was a wonderful woman.
Inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days.
That's it, I sure as hell ain't no personal shopper.
Black of course.
But the second mouse gets the cheese.
You change partners, you change the rules.
She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
We wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces, you know? And they don't come off. But when you find the one person who really knows you, and then you lose her...
What's your point?
Yeah?  I should learn to do stuff like that. They make the place feel real homey.
The what?
And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking to?  He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list.
For what?
It's enough -- for whatever you need, for whatever your girls need, for whatever your girls' girls need -- it'll be enough.
Oh my God.  Oh my God.
... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids.
I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --
Where's Anna?
Now, why in the hell would you assume that?
Boy, are you ever a shitty judge of people.
You wanna know, you gotta hire me back.  I got a lot of bills to pay.
So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.
It sure as hell sounded like they were sitting up and taking notice.
Yeah.  Isn't that a shame?
I know how DNA works, Erin --
I don't remember seeing any ponds up there.
I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.
Show me the document that proves that.
What?  Who?
Some guy in a truck -- he waited till I was alone, then he followed me, like, two miles. Jesus, I'm shaking.  Get me a beer.
It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I deserve.  Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
Okay, look.  It's an important meeting. Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --
Kurt thought?  What about you?  Do you think anymore?
And, what, I'm not serious?
The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the doctor says --
"I can always find someplace else to work. Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ..."
Nope.  And I didn't ask.
Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch.
Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin.  Brockovich. From the file room?  I was wondering if you could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up on that real estate thing out of the office.
Well, God damn it, Matthew -- Randy's mom doesn't work eighteen-hour days, and Randy's dad didn't leave her, so figuring out who's gonna take who where is a little easier over at Randy's house.
That's all you got, lady.  Two wrong feet. In fucking ugly shoes.
You need help with your kids?  I could probably do that.
Cause I don't even know you.
I'm not a deadbeat.  I work when I need to.
Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.
Yup.  Usually working on my bike.  No big deal.  If it doesn't work out, you can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady.
Fixing a leak under your sink.
Keep your voice down.
Cause it's my office party.  If you had an office, I'd go to your party.
Hi.  It's me.  I got a favor to ask you.
We'll just be a minute.  Get a little more sleep.
I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine.  I don't even know how much they cost.
Have you been logging on?
Next week.
No one put me up to anything.  I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.
Right, I guess those are the kids --
They've both got some immune system problem. Can't say what from, whether it's viral or genetic or what, but something's wrong.  And these guys -- Donna and Peter --
You did?
Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
He's too old.  Yes.  Too old to start the training.
The boy is our last hope.
And that is why I must go.
Everyone's invited, of course.
Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm.
Yeah ...
Can't get your ship out?  Have you tried?  Have you tried?
Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.
Because of my father, I guess.
We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.
The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.
I understand.  A death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... Until our paths cross again, may the force be with you.
The kid ran into something mean, and it wasn't the cold.
I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior.
Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.
Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?
Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.
Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started.
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
Or you ran into something ....
Aren't I?  Hang on, sweetheart. We're gonna do some flyin'.
Right.  I'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones ...
I do not!
Look, we just got this bucket going again.  I'm not about to let some varmint tear it apart ...
Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
Never heard of that system.
Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.
A mining colony.
A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.
Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.
Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...
I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long.
I'm sorry too.
This ought to be good.
I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
I understand.
Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.
Let's go.
That they are.
That won't be necessary.
They look pretty docile.
I should.  I've been doing it half my life to Humans.
It's a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus. Genetically engineered. 100% pure death. Complete nervous system shutdown. You crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. Not a pretty sight.
He jumped. Down there.  He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken.
Where's Plissken?
So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
Defense against what?
So you want me to take her out?  Is that an order from the President?
Locked.
I'm here.
No way.
Looking to get out.
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
Down that way.
Are you crazy?
Oh no, it's the Doctor.
It's where they live. I guess after everything happened, they just needed to do what they'd always done before. During the daytime, they just pull down the shades on their windows and sleep.
I've been doin' that all my life. Might as well do it in L.A. Everybody else there is.
Give me the prototype.
I sought only not to harm you, sir.
I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
We fought and won battles, and now one man defeats all my knights? I will go.
I'm going.
And you cannot love me...
You, my lord.
And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, please... Morgana.
That I cannot.
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
Well why are they tearing the building down?
Yes.
What's this?
Yeah, well I guess you should've.
I can't believe it.
Of course I didn't.
What is it?
It's serious?
We still don't know.
Not that I know of.
Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.
Good morning Karl. Oh Karl, we've got rats in the attic you better get some traps.
Uh huh. 'Fraid so.
Karl!!
No. It wasn't me. I didn't.
It affects concentration.
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
Oh no, that was no spasm. I got on the bed, the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. The whole thing, with me on it!
The temperal lobe is very common. Could last for days, even weeks. It isn't rare to find destructive or even criminal behaviour.
Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I mean.
I think it's time we started looking for a psychiatrist.
Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
Father?
When can I have one?
We'll see Regan.  Now about those party invitations.......
He's nice.
Mr. Dennings?
Your not gonna marry him are you?
Well I heard differently.
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
Oh, honey.
What we missed in the EEG and the arteriogram could conceivably turn up there. At the least, it would eliminate certain other possibilities.
Where'd you get it then?
I believe you.
That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
In time. But mirabile dictu, don't you agree?
Ego te abslovo.
Quod nomen mihi est?
No.
The Lord be with you.
Let us pray. Holy Lord, almighty Father, everlasting God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who once and for all consigned that fallen tyrant to the flames of hell. Who sent your only begotten son into the world to crush that roaring lion.
Her heart.
You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
Let me tell you how Father, and please confidential. Burke Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps leading to 'M' Street, with his head turned completely around. Facing backwards.
Very much.
Yeah, I hate to go alone. You know, I like to talk film; discuss the critique. D'you wanna see a film with me? I got passes to The Crest. It's Othello.
Are you tired?
...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!!! It is he who commands you! He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to the depths of hell!
...from this creature of God!!!
It's my goddamn car!
Mondays.
Now?  Why not tomorrow?  After the show.
It's all there.  Both nights.
Swimming trunks.
You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
Frank.
Teeth.
How many?
Wait.  Watch.  Here comes Dad.
Two nights.
That's not the point.
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
Of course, back then, things were a little different.  I was eight, Jack was seven, just about the only song we knew was 'My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean', and the only one who would listen to us was the family cat, Cecil.  We must have shaved three lives off that cat, eh, Jack?
Jack...
Fuck him.
I hate your kids, Frank.
She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that?
Bosen black.  Flat.
Trust me, you're not missing anything.
Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?
It's only a ring.  Not a collar.
So do I.
Your older brother.
So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
The trees.  The flowers.  Nice.
Terrific.
It wasn't like that.
I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
All right.  What's your name?
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
Okay?
I just wish she'd get here, that's all.
Here, how's this?
That's it except for the first. We got the Sheraton, the Ambassador, or the Holiday Inn on Sixtieth.  All three-day turns.
Right.
Very realistic.
Thanks, but I've got plans.
We do.  She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries.
A few bars!
Good idea.  To Peggy Lee.
Doesn't it matter to you?
I love you.  I just wanted to say it.
You're a heavy sleeper, Frank. You've always-been a heavy sleeper.  Unlike me.
No, you're wrong.  It's just beginning. Come on, have a drink. Show your big brother how it's done.
Right.  It's incredible how you do that.  Remember things.
You always threw up.
I can't make the tenth.
Better give her pneumonia.
I don't know. Some disease.
Basketballs, Frank.  You had us playing for basketballs.
It wasn't professional, Jack.  It was a stunt. A stupid-ass stunt.
You weren't there.
Yeah, fine.
There's not going to be a viewing. I figured with the kids and all ...
I'll take the Mallory.
Good choice.
I can keep the beat.
Moran.  Monica.  The whole thing. It's my stage name.  My real name's Blanche.
Blanche.
It's one of Jack's favorites.
Just like that, huh?  You're not even gonna give me a chance?
What-?
Time for what?
We're not exactly silly with time, you know.  Jack, you find anything?
Zip me up?
Piece of cake.
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?
Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
It's paradise.  That's what it is. Paradise.
They must've bought the same map we did.
Well then ... shall we?
I'll call you.
Gotta go.
Funny job.
Regular hours are eight to five.
All right.  Hold on.
Save it.  What's he look like?
Every year.
It's the waves.  God's music, my mother used to say. She was crazy for the ocean.
I'm not upset.
Ed? How many people live here?
Sure.
Long story.
He had a mind that escalated things.
Yeah... No.
Huh?
Oh. Carrots.  And peas.  None of the important ones.
Well, this is some surprise.  Hey ... You don't look so good, pal.
Yeah.
Married.
How do you know?
Looks old.
Eighty proof. What d'ya say? Think you can handle it?
That's what I want to do. I want to make a snowman.
He's losing his teeth.
You look great, Castor. Really.  Here -- I got a shot of your favorite -- Mescal.  Even has the worm.
He hit a guard.
Try to kiss my butt just once before I'm transferred.
Yeah -- me.
You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
How old is he?
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
Is that what you think?
It's important.
Something good?
We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.
Must've been after we got engaged.
Okay, you're having an emotional crisis.  You need to seek the help of a trained --
Don't hang up ...
He's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.
The bomb.  He's reactivated it.  And everyone there is going to die.
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
That's what they always say.
Go on.
Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
What're you gonna do with me gone?  You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?
Shoot him!
You'll be seeing a lot of changes around here. Daddy's a new man.
I mean like protection.
Yeah, mom cut me some slack -- but I decided ... I'd like to be here for you.  Here, mom.  You can have it back.  Thanks, though.
Like I fucking care?  I'm not just sitting here!
I had doubts too.  I always looked at a desk as though it were a ball-and-chain. But something happened ...
Jon, you're starting to remind me -- of me.  Congratulations.
The hospital.
Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
That's what I'd like to know.  She stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off.
I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
Wheres my real dad?
The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
I think I could figure it out.
Sure.
Check...
Thats where you work.
Ah. A classic...
Its your birthday? Today?  Whats your name?  Where were you born?
What the hell are you talking about?  Whats he talking about?
You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.
No?  Cmon, Jack...Ive got everything I need, I dont have regrets, thats just not for me... sound familiar?
You?  What about me?  Im working hard for you here, Jack.  On Christmas too!  Now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way.  I was moved...
As long as it takes to figure it out.  Which, in your case, could be considerable.
Look, I just want my life back.  Now whats it gonna take?  You wanna talk turkey?  Lets talk turkey!  How much money...?
What are you talking about?  Its me, Jack Campbell.  Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!
Right, for us. But...Im afraid that if you get on that plane...
No, youre right.  What are we doing?
Look, you dont understand.  I woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...
I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
Its ten thirty, Jack. By eleven youre gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We dont have time for wining and dining.
Look at me like you havent seen me every day for the last twelve years...
If you want to look at it that way...
How would you look at it?
I want it...
Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
Enjoy it, sweetheart...
What are you talking about?  You never wait all day.  You can barely wait until its light out.
How do you even know about this place?
Now...I dont...
Ill just full yours up to the top.  Happy anniversary, sweetheart.
Thats all I wanted to hear...
I dont think Id fight you on that one...
For the week?
But Ive done some good things too, havent I?
Not exactly...  Can we just take a minute here?  Maybe get a cup of coffee or something...?
Dont get on that plane!
Jack.
Hello Jack.  You dont have to stop singing on my account...
A shelter?!  Im the richest guy in the building...Ive got twice the square footage you have!
That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
Not exactly. Ive seen you on CNBC.  You look taller in real life...
Is there anything I can do for you?
So we'll get egg nog.
I'm taking the train...
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
Yes!
Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again.
Give me the god damn mirror!
Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
I already got it.  Everything I want.
Is it safe?
The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
They're not costumes.
Last one down springs for room service.
That's the temperature of the <u>sun</u>.
<u>Girl</u>...?!
Blockhead started it!
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
As soon as you stop <u>acting</u> like one. Come on, you're <u>smarter</u> than this. You think those people out there <u>care</u> about you?  You're just a <u>fad</u> to them.
But Johnny...you <u>can't fly</u>.
Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.
<u>Ben</u> did this?
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll.  You remember my brother Johnny...
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a <i>massive amount of evidence</i> before making that leap.
Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
I'm sure I can come up with something.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny.  At least they can go out in public.  But for you?  People staring. Whispering behind your back...
Before he could breathe a word. He's the only scientist who knows the answer to what we're after. That's why we have to operate --
Say that again?
And take a little trip with them...
It's only for an hour --
Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
Difficult? He's impossible!
I -- I want to say...
Thank you for volunteering.
Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
No, it requires such absolute precision --
I've got a source. All I have to do is tap it.
All I'm asking is you test it beforehand!
If it won't work, it's beyond my power to fix it. But if it does, there's no telling how long it will hold up. It's a jury rig, at best, and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it. That's why I don't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests.
No, there's no other way.
"Proclaiming in incandescent glory The myriad Mind of Man..."
We could follow the Optic Nerve to the corner of the Eye.
It's too late!
Well, it seems to me if you reduce a ship to microscopic size -- and the stream remains constant -- we'd take quite a beating.
Well, we better get on with it.
I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory.
Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.
Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
May I have your ticket, please?
Drop that fucking money!
Is this a fucking joke here?
It certainly is, officer. Still got that smell!
I don't know. Few munce.
No.
Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -
So why don't you just ask him for the money?
What the heck d'ya mean?
...The heck d'ya mean?
They can really take over, that's for sure.
Oh, now he's adorable.
Oh, he's adorable.
Oh, don't be silly.
Yah, right-o.
Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra. You're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.
Yah.
So you were having sex with the little fella, then?
Oh, yah?
Oh, those numbers are all right, bleemee.
Yah.
No! We can't let anyone know about this thing! We gotta play ball with these guys - you ask Stan Grossman, he'll tell ya the same thing!
I wonder if I could take just a minute of your time here -
Huh? Do you mind if I sit down - I'm carrying quite a load here.
but do you know that for sure without -
Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doin' my job here.
Sure right now! You're darned tootin'!
Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
That's for sure. Now, I just need, on these last, these financing documents you sent us, I can't read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here, so I -
I'm sure they do - ha ha! But I can't read their serial numbers here. So if you could read me -
Okay.
My patience is at an end.
Be back in a minute. If Stan calls you, just tell him I went to Embers. Oh, geez -
2:30.
Yah.
Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd guarantee ya your money back.
Well, a course they're gonna say that! But where's my protection? They got Jean here! I give these sons a bitches a million dollars, where's my guarantee they're gonna let her go.
Ah, dammit!
Now come on here, no way, Wade!  No way!
Well, that's okay, he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm not worryin'. I just, I was wonderin', see, I gotta get in touch with 'em for, I might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see -
Yah, looks pretty bad. Two of'm're over here.
Yah?
Yah.
You haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya?
Yah.
Yah.
Yah - how are you doon?
Yah - easy there - you do too!  I'm expecting, ya know.
Oh, yah, a long time ago.
Great. What brings ya down - are ya down here on that homicide - if you're allowed, ya know, to discuss that?
No, I - Mike - wyncha sit over there, I'd prefer that.
Well, they're a good outfit.
I always liked ya so much...
Linda.
Copy.
You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
Oh, pretty good. They bitin'?
No, no.
Yah, I guess.
And his wife?
His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C.
And this Shep Proudfoot character, he's a little darling. He's now wanted for assault and parole violation. He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large.
Have you finished those reports?
Yes.
Hmm?
Well, if any ideas come to you, give me a call.  In the meantime, don't leave town.  I may need to bring you in for questioning.
Go ahead.  I'll expose you.
Really?
You're kidding.
You can't have the whole brain!
We'll split it.  You get it the first and third Sunday of the month.
Deal.
Should we?
This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
It suits you.
Here.
Feel anything?
Well... thanks, anyway.
Do you care?
It was the smart move on her part.
Have we been talking too long?  Must we change the subject?
That day you came over to my place to play doctor... what was going on there?
What kind of stupid question is that?!
Will you just answer me, for Christsake?!
What is wrong with you?
Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  I thought they were going to break my arm.
What?
You are an insane person.
No, no, shut up!  I've had enough. I tried, Tyler... I have tried...
Yes, fine.  Just, get on.  Stay away a couple of weeks, at least.
Well... let me see... here's the thing...
You were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. It's tight as a drum.
Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host to cancer or parasites; I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.
That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love, well, it works both way.
Being clever.
Well, uh... great.
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
Delivered from bullshit colors like "Cobalt," "Ebony," and "Fuchsia."
The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list.  That list.
The things you own, they end up owning you.
We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
No, I...
Would that be a problem?
Is it a problem for you to ask?
Only a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at work.
What car?
Oh, a new riot control grenade...  "...the successful combination of concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash- blasts and simultaneous high-velocity disbursement of...blah, blah, blah..."
Okay... Ghandi.
Listen... do me a favor... sit here a minute...
This clear layer in glycerin.  We'll mix it back in when we make the soap.
What is it?
What should I have told you?
Look...
Should I E-mail you?  Should I put this on your "action item list?"
What are you doing?!
Tyler...
You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you.
I would feel nothing about my life? Is that what you want to hear?!
... is over.
You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me.
What... ?
It's okay.  We okay... a little codependent, sure, but...
You... you can't be serious about this.
Green?  Did you say green?
Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see alright?  10... 9... 8....
Fuck that, maybe you're my hallucination.
Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?
What?
Maintenance.
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
Robert Paulson is dead.  He's dead, because of you...
I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
Congratufuckinglations.  That makes you last to go.  But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.  Always does.
That still doesn't make sense.  You said you die in the same order you were originally meant to.  But Evan Shaeffer died last in my premonition, not first.
So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.
No, it's not here.  This one was different.  More like the pile up and the van going into the lake.
I have to save Eugene!
If only Alex and I had done that with the others, Alex might still be...
Carter.
Who?
Take a guess.
I never mad it.  The Greyhound bus I was on splattered some chick all over the road and we had to stop.
They're next on the list.  We have to find them.
Hold on.
Yeah, I thought he was supposed to be helpful.
Fix-A-flat?  Road flares? Sunblock?  Mace?
What feeling?
Yeah, but everything's always in transition. If you focus, even now, one week into summer... you can feel Autumn coming.  Almost like bein' able... to see the future.
Like you, the sculpture doesn't even know what, or why, it is. Reluctant to take form. And, yet, creating an absolute but incomprehensible attraction.
No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.
Get out! Get out of the car!
But I saved him. I intervened. Just like the plane. That's the design.
Been on many planes that blew up, have you?
I know who you are.
I know what you're doing!  It's alright to be scared, Carter. You don't have to prove to us how big your balls are. Not now.
Put it in the guard's barracks.  Man they got pissed.  They beat the crap out of me, but... it's kind of a tradition.  You oughta see 'em run around.
One hundred.
That's what I'm here for.
Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
We're leaving tonight, not in a week.
There's a compass in the handle.
Sometimes they do.  They're river pirates.  Opium runners.
Alright.  Home run.
Ain't you coming with us, sweet thing?
Duck soup.
How much we got left in that minigun?
Huntington Beach, California.
It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.
Yes.  But I lose many merits in next life.  Very bad.
How you going to get there?  You can't trust the spooks to pull you out.  They'll use you up and throw you away.
We like you.  At least the computer at Langley likes you.  Pulled your file because of various factors.  Service record. Area familiarity.
What?
POWs?  I don't know.  But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks.  Cream?
It's not necessary.
"Terminate with extreme prejudice."
I could take it or leave it.
There were treating me like a headcase.
What did you want?
Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed.
I don't understand you. What is the problem?
Hey? What did I tell you? Why don't you come? It's just dinner. You'll have something to tell your mother next time she calls.
This food's delicious.  You're a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home.
Yeah, well... suicidal paranoiacs say funny things sometimes.
<u>Oh my God</u>... <u>What did they do</u>!  <u>My</u> <u>God</u>!!!
Oh sure... Gotta believe in God.  But I don't think God made man in his own image.  No.  'Cause most of... the bullshit that happens, is because of men.  No, I think man was made out of the devil's image and women were created out of God -- because women can have babies which is sorta like creating, and which also explains why women are attracted to men, because, lets face it, the devil is a helluva lot more interesting -- I slept with a few saints and let me tell you... <u>Booooorring</u>!!!... And so the whole point of life, I think, is for men and women to get married so the devil and God can live together and, ya know -- work it out...  ... Not that we have to get married.
I get this feeling like I'm... a magnet but I attract shit.  Out of all the people in this city, why did I meet a man who's wife I killed?
You're calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office. You must think I'm some dope.  You fuckin' bastard... You...  ... stay out all night long...
The moron?
... I would love to start looking at least.  You know, maybe a two bedroom or even, maybe the top floor of a house -- like in Brooklyn or Staten Island...
No.
Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?  He'll snap out of it?
I'm a man with a mission, Jack.
NO! I want a debutante on a horse to step on me.  Leave me alone!!
Fine.
... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to?
Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
A list.
Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her.
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
No... thanks... Listen --
My name is Parry.
<u>What</u>?!
I'm the one what?
The Little...
Well, if every time someone did something offensive they hit in the head with a pebble, I think they might alter their behavior. What do you think Jack...
I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.
Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
No. I think you're a moron and I don't want to get into trouble.
It's a classic.
What?
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
Ha, ha, ha, ha rubbish...now begone...before somebody drops a house on you!...
No just Parry.
Oh...like Moses.
I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals.
What are we about to do?
Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
I don't drink coffee...
So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now...  ... I'm not coming up to your apartment.  That was never my idea.
Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...
Your little friend's real sharp there...  Yeah, I don't like to wear the wig on TV, because with two and a half million people watching you, you've gotta be sincere. I just like to wear it when I'm out slippin' around bowling alleys an' things like that. I think it gives me a little more class, don't you?
Now, now.
No, dammit, I would easy.
That's right, hand.
Yes.
You go slippin' around in front a my face, an' in front a Elton an' Stoney. What do you imagine they think a someone you treat that way...
You're goin' a find me dead one time.
"You'll be burned out/Or smoked out/An' come back to me, I know..."
What the hell is that?
I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone.
I don't know.
No.
Washington.
We'll get off in Washington and hook another ride.
Who? People, that's who! Pretty soon there won't be room for anyone. They're selling more crap that people go and buy than you can imagine. Oofh! Crap! I believe everybody should have a big hole where they throw in all this stuff and burn it.
It's just filthy. People are dirty. I think that's the biggest thing that's wrong with people. I think they wouldn't be as violent if they were clean, because then they wouldn't have anybody to pick on... Oofh... Dirt...
I'll come back when you've made up your mind...
Hi, Tita.
Sort of.
What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?
My turn.
Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...
I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
If you're free.
I gave it a second thought.
Nothing. It's just that... I picked the easiest piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it better then.
I didn't have any.
Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
I'd like you to leave now. Is that direct enough?
No, you don't have to, it isn't necessary...
Yes, it is!
Will you let me talk to you, please?
Yes.
I think these cold, "objective" discussions are aggressive, Samia...
Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.
I have a suggestion. Why don't we take a break.
Fine.
God, I just wanna speak to you. I just wanna speak to you the way I feel about you.
Wussup.
Remember me, from the pool?
You know. I got a lot, more than one.
Just chill.
Well, you know I'm standin' here and you say I look good?
I won't let my motha cut my hair.
I'm not goin' to 10th Street, people piss and shit in that pool,
Eddie from Compost?
Um, yeah I think so.
Positive.
My friend told me she lived around here.
Probably.  One of the many.
What?
Nothing.
You gotta girLfrLend?
That's what he said.
I'm no lawyer, but I do believe that's a violation of my rights.
Its been very nice meeting you. I enjoy your column.
Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?
Go ahead. Make my evening.
Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?
I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
I can't discuss another patient. You know that.  Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.
For sure?
Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted.
My associates did a biopsy on this man recently.  He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it.
My lawyer was a bum.
Are you serious?
I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?
Oh, about ten days ago.
What the hell does this have to do with insurance?
What?
Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
That's Brazil.
Why not?
Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
Charmed.
Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you.
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
They serve dinner on the flight?
I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
You sure got the hard part.
Sure.
Only if you promise not to return me.
Deal.
Not me.
Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
Spot right here.
Check every hotel in L.A. Start with the ones near the airport. Yeah. He's about to leave the country with her. Thanks, Lar.
I'm sorry?
Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some.
Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours.
We used to fly together. I'm... John.
John Ultrarelamensky.
Mind if I keep practicing? I need to work on my ground stroke a little.
See what I mean?
Hi.
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him.
Why did you do it?
Irwin Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad.
Stop it.  Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?
Just give me twenty-four hours. Please. Someone almost killed me today. People are not being nice lately, and I don't want you getting hurt. I think you're terrific. Are you a Laker fan?
Act natural.
I'm calling the police. Right now.
I want to hear this.
They just left, sir.
They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
In her cabana, sir.
One.
No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
Muchas gracias.
I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
What?
She moved out.
I'm her cousin.
Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.
I never read the paper.
I have pictures of him. Dealing...
Frank, you animal, I love it. I'll have the story by Thursday night, I swear to God.  I hope.
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about.
What...
No, I ain't got you...
Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
Hold that thought.  Are we being shot at?
Thanks, I needed that.
I never thought I'd be jealous of your handicap... Sorry to hear about Bobby Vomit.
Exactly.
I'm sorry, that dress.  What do you say we...
Hello...  It's Colleen.  With answers.  She wants to meet.  Down.  Way down-town.  Late.
Let's get her out of here, before she starts a shoot-out.  Drop us at my place.
Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s.  Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.
Scalping to a funeral, you're a pretty sleazy guy.
Three hundred.
What?
Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
I'm so sure!  I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and...
Who cares about people?
Let go of the belt!  What are you doing?  You got mad at me for trying to save the other guy.
Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy.  Kill!  Kill!  Kill!
Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked...
Really?
An asshole?  A swine?  A ballistic turd?  Pick one.  I never knew what a blessing my accident was until he died and I had to take over the company.  You see the music is irrelevant in this industry.  I'm going to have to ship this 'wick-prick' platinum just so teenage girls can have a compact disc cover to get wet with.
Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
What about Don?
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Cause if I do.
Everything is everything.
B.O.C.A.
What?
You know I hadda meet some people tonight --
Well try, okay?
Yeah?
Are you having trouble raising the half million?
It's yours too!
Comment va-t-elle?
Il est en retard.
Sois gentil avec lui.  On ne sait jamais.  Il peut te faire travailler  la tlvision.
He got off on six.
Des Moines.
Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.
Case?  So far I haven't seen a damn thing.
What for -- you wanna play Hide the Salami with his old lady?
Come on -- just for fun --
We're goin' now!  Goodbye.
Let yourself in.
The crazy kid handcuffed me to the bed.  With my own cuffs.
The river at this point is the most dangerous on the East Coast.  Years ago, hundreds of ships went down here.
He could go someplace else with his sixty kilos of heroin and see how easy it is to pull together a half million cash.  He wouldn't find there was any hurry to do this kind of business.
What are you saying?
What I know is what I told you.
So what?
We tried.  Bulkhead door's rusted shut. Won't budge.
It was under control, Bud.  Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
Nothing.  I just wanted to see you.
No.  Not our Johnny.  I mean, it's Johnny...but not now...in the future.
Hello, Frank.
Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
Daddy, I'm scared.
15-band closes down at night.  During the day you can chew the band with China if you want.
What?
Hello?
Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
I'm not dreaming.
What's happening?
Thirty-five?  That would make it...
1998.
I don't understand.
October 22, 1969.
Whatta you mean...
He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten.
I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away.
Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off?
You all right?
He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
What?
What...
Huh?
I think it's somewhere in the closet... if you can find it.
Huh?
Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right? The cigarettes?
Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.
You got a deal, mister.  I mean Santa.
She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
Which means he probably knew her.
Yeah.  Sure.
Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
No.  What house you work?
Nah, just working the job.
I found this today.  There were other pieces of the body lying there, but I believe "he" wanted me to have this...
That's an eyeball!  Oh, God!
I did?!  I broke the world's record.
Actually, I have no idea what the World's Record is.  I was just kidding.
You can play with yourself, 'cause I'm going in the house.
It's the last house on the left. She lives downstairs.
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters.
Did you stay here last night?
I'm here with you.  Can't that be enough for now?
It's all right, you're all right. I'm with you.
Yes.
I do like you.  But not when you act like a jerk.
I admit nothing without talking to my lawyer.
Why?
Why?  Because I've seen enough horror movies to know masked weirdos are never friendly.
He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
Better call an ambulance first.
Sheriff, you better take this.
I thought Jason was only a legend?
And make sure my daughter stays put...  ...She's grounded.
No.
It probably wouldn't have any effect on him.  The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.
There was this monster.  He was after me.  He wanted to kill me.
Huh?
Who ya calling?
Hold it.  Whoa... What's your name, son?
If I had you where I really wanted you, they'd be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde.
I understand.  However, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher.
No.  Not here.  Come by my house tonight at eleven.  Don't be late.
Okay.  So how is Jessica?  You talked to her lately?
June the 19th.
She's your lady only cause she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.
Sorry.
Hell, when Steven was a kid, he was like, having strippers delivered to church Bingos and shit.
Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?
Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
Gotta go.  See you guys later.
Until I hear the truth.
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
But I haven't even shown you my biology project...
And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
But that doesn't prove that he's the one!
My niece's life hangs in the balance right now!! Every second counts.
I'll take some lessons this time. I promise.
I was only trying to teach you. But I pulled you out, Rennie. I saved your life.
What about not-so-great writers?
That's wonderful, Miss Van Deusen...what's it about?
No, but I'm sure Toby's fine. The ship's only so big and there's certainly no way off it, is there?
Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.
About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school.
We changed our minds.
If I go with you, he'll never speak to me again.  But I'm never going to live up to his expectations anyway...so maybe it's the right thing to do.
Crosstown.
Press a button and they give us money.
She wants a divorce.
Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.
What was it like?
What?
Keep going west. Last building before the river.
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?
I talked to her two days ago.
Our Peter?
Can he get through it?
This is how we've managed to last.
We don't even like each other, do we?
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
Your mother and I have something between us that's too strong to damage permanently. Believe me, I know this. That's right, nineteen years. And what about the days and minutes? Sharing small moments, sharing memories, raising a beautiful child. We're wedded in the deepest and strongest ways. Lillian isn't only my wife. She's my best friend.
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.
I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.
That's very lovely actually.
There may be things you'd rather not know about.
It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
Washed away.
Go way. I'll call a cop.
Pop, will you let me in?
Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.
I know, Pop.
Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
What am I doing?
You're charming the boy.
Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
Washed away.
The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one.
Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
I kissed her while she was laughing.
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
He wears a disguise.
I don't know.
Where are you going now?
Never mind.
But you're here. So you must have come to me.
Everyone takes his turn.
It is the work of untouchables.
All the more reason.
I expect you to show as much patience as I am now.
Did they take your clothes?
Ah, but my puritanism runs the another way. I'm far too modest for such a display.
Oh, I've been a Gandhi buff for a long time.
Back in South Africa...  long time ago.
I say when is now -- and we will determine how.
It's split the Government.
Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think --
Well, if you ask, General Smuts, I'm sure it will be done.
Somehow I expected not.
I congratulate them.
Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi.
I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
There are a few million miles to go yet.
I guess so.  Well, while you're up there, maybe you could tidy the place up a bit.
What a pity.
We're already getting complaints about frivolous search.
No, we've missed something.  We Hoover again.
So we have two choices.  Either our suspect came back to the murder scene for a drink of water and I don't know anybody that thirsty or...  ...he <i>is</i> here.  We test again.  You're right, Hugo, this was a desperate act.  Someone had a lot to lose that night--perhaps their place in line.  I'd like the profiles of everyone with an upcoming mission.
Where did you get this?
What a relief.
I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
He's too tall.
I think I'd better choose the menu.  After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be <i>you</i>.
German.
Wrong color.  It's silver.  It's not easy living up to this.
Listen, I bag this stuff anyway.  It may as well pay my rent.
The Mission Director.
What <i>is</i> that one?
A day or so.
We can't stay here.
They think I offed the Director.
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
Never stopped you before.  And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.
She doesn't <i>have</i> to know.  She doesn't <i>want</i> to know.
We'll still be able to talk when I'm away. The conversation will just keep getting longer.
I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer.
I was never very good at it, remember?
How the hell did you get here.
In case you get back before I do.
Where are you going?
Vincent, come down.  I've found him.
Why are you inventing problems?  You two are a couple of goddam clones.  You look so right together, I want to double my fee.
I've found him too.
Yes.
What exactly is wrong?
It's not safe.  I shouldn't have brought you here.
Honey, you've made <i>one</i> mistake--
Hard to judge how these things happen. The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions.
Get it over with...
Hi.
It looks fine.
What do you mean? You've never been there.
I've been there every day for the last four years.
No. It's been a long time.
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
I didn't. I just waited.
Nail him first, be careful he doesn't panic and want to shoot somebody. Local police have one car, a rover, shouldn't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it's answering an emergency call... if the cop car shows up remember it doesn't have any automatic weapons. Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard. Get into a tight spot, you'll be out of range at forty yards. Then they're down to their side guns.
It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
You sent me to him.
Who's she?
Fifteen minutes.
Why, there's nothing on the news?
I did I killed a man.
I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...
We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
Oh my God.
Okay. How many bank exits?
Chambers - Reilly. Time lock opens 20 minutes before they start doing business...
One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
Whatever you need.
Dillinger got killed.
Can't leave the desk.
You serious?
Wish you hadn't said that. When Slim Canfield's lips are sealed, they're sealed.
That right?
Two years.
Collar bone is broken. No infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day.
I know. I know.
Did Eric Pake pull her?
How?
And you told Brumby?
Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.
Yes.
Christ, what...
You stay in the car. I'll come and listen.  What you want to tell me, Thorpey?
Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?
You know Sid Fletcher?
Really?
While he was here. You went about together?
Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?
To the demon king's castle, of course.
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
Yeah.
Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
Thanks for coming.
I left last year.
Did you work with him, Keith?
That's what I was wondering.
Oh yes? How?
It never is.
Funny.  Can I phone London?
Stick the soft soap. Let's be having it.
And what about you? Did you kill Brumby?
Pension him off.
What am I supposed to do?  I don't know where they've taken him. Do you?
No.
No. Are you tired?
And that'll make me feel better?
A bereavement. A death in the family.
That's all right, Eric.
Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.
Yeah,  Come off it, Eric. Who is it?
Making a living.
Yes, I retained that, Eric.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric?
He's thinking Sid and Gerald won't like it much when they hear you've been sticking your nose in.
If I'd known, I'd have fixed him up with something better.
Yeah.
Your hundred, and another hundred.
Three hundred altogether, Harry.
That's right.
You get those names come up, you ever get 'em, "Patel?"
You ever get 'em?
What?
They came in and they, you know...
We're stuck with this...
That's right?
And so they kill the goose.  I, I, I'll...and a fuckin' man, worked all his life has got to...
Yes.
You hear a lot of things...He's doing very well.  He's doing very well.
You don't ax your sales force.
Men come work for you...
Yes...?
What?
Huh.
You're actually talking about this?
Did you talk to Graff?
What did he say?
He'd give me a job.
They'll know when you go over to Graff...
What does that mean?
Absolutely.
So I'm making it concrete.
They're ancient.
Clear...
Clear Meadows.  That shit's dead.
It's a waste of time.
They stole the...
They stole the phones.
Yeah.  That's swell.  Another waste of time.
You understand?
Fuck.  I had them on River Glen.
That's great.
Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.
Who are you?
Hey, fella, let's get this done...
...you want to see the court records?  John?  Eh?  You want to go down...
...no...
Lately kiss my ass lately.  That isn't how you build an org...talk, talk to Murray.  Talk to Mitch. When we were on Peterson, who paid for his fucking car?  You talk to him.  The Seville...?  He came in, "You bought that for me Shelly." Out of what?  Cold calling.  Nothing. Sixty-five, when we were there, with Glen Ross Farms?  You call 'em downtown.  What was that?  Luck? That was "luck"?  Bullshit, John. You're burning my ass, I can't get a fucking lead...you think that was luck.  My stats for those years? Bullshit...over that period of time...?  Bullshit.  It wasn't luck. It was skill.  You want to throw that away, John...?  You want to throw that away?
Either way.  You're out.
...they kicked out.
And fifty bucks a lead.
That's alright.
Somebody broke in.
It's not impossible.
You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...
No.  It hadn't.
You're so full of shit.
I...
How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?
Where have you been, Shelly?  Bruce and Harriet Nyborg.  Do you want to see the memos...?  They're nuts... they used to call in every week. When I was with Webb.  And we were selling Arizona...they're nuts...did you see how they were living?  How can you delude yours...
Their check's no good?  They're nuts...?
"Bruce, Harriet...Fuck me, believe in yourself..."
"'Why?  Why don't I get the opportunities...?"
Last night, this morning.
"You have to believe in yourself... you"--look--"alright...?"
I just put Jim into Black Creek...are you acquainted with...
The monthly interview...?
Oh!  For the magazine...
Oh!  My God...I've got to get you on the plane!
Ricky...
Gimlet.
My wife...
Three business days.  They mean three business days.
What would have elapsed?
When did you write the check?
Yest...
Tuesday.
I just called downtown, and it's on their desk.
She wants her money back.
No, Jim.
Where are you going...?  This is me...This is Ricky, Jim.  Jim, anything you want, you want it, you have it.  You understand?  This is me.  Something upset you.  Sit down, now sit down.  You tell me what it is.  Am I going to help you fix it? You're goddamned right I am.  Sit down.  Tell you something...? Sometimes we need someone from outside.  It's...no, sit down...Now talk to me.
That...
Forget the deal, Jimmy.  Forget the deal...you know me.  The deal's dead.  Am I talking about the deal?  That's over.  Please. Let's talk about you.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on, Jim.  I want to tell you something.  Your life is your own.  You have a contract with your wife.  You have certain things you do jointly, you have a bond there...and there are other things.  Those things are yours.  You needn't feel ashamed, you needn't feel that you're being untrue...or that she would abandon you if she knew.  This is your life.  Yes.  Now I want to talk to you because you're obviously upset and that concerns me.  Now let's go. Right now.
You hear what I said?
When...
Harriet and blah blah Nyborg.
Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
Who's my pal...?  And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean?  Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...?  What are you, friend to the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  I never liked you.
The...
It went down.  I filed it.
I...
With what?  With what, John, they took the leads...
Yes.
Did you like your party?
No.  He would give it away.  I know how to repay a consideration.
Go on, answer him when he talks to you.  Tell him: Columbus, Marconi... Garibaldi.
She couldn't decide.
I got surprises for everybody!
Connie.
I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
No, Dad.
It's not talk; I'm doing it.
The child cannot harm you.
 You must understand, this is all new to me...
I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.
We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  Nobody gets near you.  You're not going any place.
You remember Willy Cicci, don't you, Freddie?  We was all together with the old man Clemenza in Brooklyn... before...uh...
We're making an investment in Havana.
No.  I mean, are you sure?
The song.  Are you sincere with me, Fredo?
What do you want me to do?
What is it?  Can I help?
He's an Italian?
In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.
I'm supposed to stay in my house.
Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat.  But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with.
With Mama, putting the baby to sleep.  Francesca's very happy. Michael was kind to her.  She idolizes him.  The children are all out in the speedboat.  I'm going to my house.
We don't know that's true, he never said that.
No.  But if they do have somebody, you'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name.
I asked about Fredo?
Roth engineered it, Michael.  He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive.  Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him.  Anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one and a lot more. There's no way we can get to him and you've opened yourself to five points of perjury.
I'm staying.  Don't ever enjoy the cruel part of all this; Sonny never listened to me about that.  Now, explain everything to me.
I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.
Did my brother go back?
Yeah, but don't worry.
He's ten times tougher than me, my brother.  He's old-fashioned.
Tom, what do I do now?
You were around the old timers who dreamed up how the Families should be organized, how they based it on the old Roman Legions, and called them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos' and 'Soldiers,' and it worked.
Thanks...friend.
This committee owes an apology!
I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're not to let you through.
In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
Why too late?
Goodbye, Michael.
Michael.
Who's asking?
No, I meant lose his family.
Technically, they are still under the Clemenza wing of the Corleone Family, now run by Frankie Pentangeli.  After Clemenza died, the Rosatos wanted territory of their own.  Pentangeli refused, and came to me, asking for permission to eliminate them.  I, of course, knew of their relationship with you, and in gratitude for your help with the Tropicana matter, turned him down.  Pentangeli was furious, and paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to have me killed. I was lucky and he was stupid. I'll visit him soon.  The important thing is that nothing jeopardize our plans, yours and mine.  This thing of ours, that we will build.
Then you have to trace it.  Michael, people here look at me as a reliable man.  I can't afford not to be looked on as a reliable man.  But you know all that; there's nothing you can learn from me.  You shouldn't have to put up with a sick old man as a partner.
Except the President of the United States.
Six million dollars in cash is a high price for a piece of a country in the middle of a revolution.
No, I'm fine.
Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.
They feel cheated.
Michael, you're sitting up here in the Sierra Mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way I run my family.
I know.  That's why I want you to be fair with them.
In my home!  In the same room where my wife was sleeping; where my children come in their pajamas, and play with their toys.
Then why do you want me to lay down to them?
Don't I look like I'm listening?
Maybe, yes... maybe no.
What a terrible misunderstanding. Of course, Signora Colombo can stay in the flat.  Who were those miserable tenants to complain about noise from a poor animal...when they pay such low rent.
Long enough.  Fifteen years.
Of course.  I am married still.
This is what the priests tell me. His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven.
My name is Whale.  This is my house.
Nice place.
I stink to high heaven right now.
They're just copies then.  Gotcha.
What did she mean by going flooey?
What is we say phooey to the hedges?  Could you spare an hour after lunch?  To sit for me?
Or a husband.  Depending on which of us you asked.  My friend David. He lived here for many years.
I told you.  I don't like to talk about that.
You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.
You're talking through your hat now.
Of course I remember.  Do you think I'm so senile --
Do I look okay?
Nothing would please me more.
Catch my death.
No.  Definitely not.
The only memento I ever kept.  My original sketch for the Monster.
I see.
It's too tight.
You'll feel better tomorrow.
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow...
Have a drink?
You know what I mean.  Your reputation.
That's what I'm trying to explain.
Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.
Boris?  Do I look a fright?
Nonsense, my dear.  You look extraordinary.  Today's script.  Quick.  And a pencil.
Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old.
Bone?  Boom?  Something Bee.  I hire him while you were in the hospital.  He came cheap.
Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.
Yes, yes, yes.  I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea. We'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard.
A visitor.
I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.
Then the rumors are true?
Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
Head.  Not heart.
I am such a goose.  I mistook you for Cecil Beaton.  It's the hat. You're wearing one of Cecil's hats, you know.
Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...
A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?
Who do you think?
Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ...
He'll live. But it means your boy's behind it. Astricky was holding a list. They just faxed it to us...
Get out of here, then. Now.
Double-meaning intended --
Keys were in it ...
How you doing, man?
It's arright ...
I think so too --
How's Kip?
You getting my checks ... ?
Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby. I don't know what you remember of him. But you should brace yourself
What am I supposed to do?
Just hold-on there --
What do you got ... ?
What?
Hey, now -
He's gonna kill you -- !
Me...
You hear me?
Shadow games ...
The era when crime didn't pay --
Hell, yeah... It's a beautiful business ...  I mean, no, man, it's hard, it's scary, it sucks ...
I don't know. What -- ?
What?
Come here -
Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.
She's for sale. They're asking forty thousand. Give 'em sixty ...
We're going shopping -- !
Call 'em here -- ?
What are you doing here?
Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
On account of me.
I left town. I didn't leave you.
If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ...
You're going high-cheese, dude --
I bet you say that to all the girls...
With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ...
Wrong preposition...
They got him to the hospital. He's stable ...
Hello, Otto ...
Are you considering a comeback tour?
The hard part ...
No we don't -
Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up
Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?
Why don't you leave him alone?
What? What happened?
No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.
Billy, how are you?
Don't go busting my balls. Okay?
Wha?  Me?
Paulie. Why would I? I swear.
Nods again.
You treated me like shit.
I thought you were going to stand me up. You looked bored. You didn't say anything. What did you expect. Tommy was all over me. Right?
I'm just having my last few drinks.
I can't do it anymore.
Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it.
Never.
Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.
But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.
They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.
Oh no! No!  Noooo!
What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
I gotta go home and get my hat.
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
Will you get the fuck out of here.
No. It's okay. Just watch this. Watch it.
I hate to do dishes.
Okay?
He's okay. They sobered him up.
I know. I know. But it'll be okay. Don't worry. I got some money for you. It's down the block.
You think that matters?  You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.
Paulie, I swear, I'm afraid. The guy's nuts. What do I have to do? Whatever I gotta do, I'll do.
Oh shit.
Guy's tryin' to walk the line--but he can't even fuckin' stand up, and so my uncle's gonna spend a night in jail. Just then there's this fuckin' BOOM like fifty yards down the road. Some guy's car hit a tree.
Fuck you, you fat fuck.
Watch what happens.
Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field.
Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to?
You don't know that.
Yeah, I figured now that you got your big job over in Cambridge, you needed some way to get over there and I knew I wasn't gonna drive you every day...
How you doin'?
What Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?
What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' the car.
Why don't you beat off at your house?
Oh, Morgan.
Retainer...
Codebreaking.
What is it?
I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
Half-red, half-black--
I don't know what it's called.
Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?
I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. So I sent my cheif negotiator.
The least you can do is show me a little appreciation.
--You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
No, that's fine, Will. I was just leaving.
I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
Uh-oh.
I did.
The Field's Medal is the Nobel Prize for math.  But it's only given out every four years.
Is there someplace we can talk?
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
--That's right, Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England.
Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the "old neighborhood?"
Jobs doing what?
--No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy--
Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.
That's a wonderful theory, Sean. It worked wonders for you.
Hold on!
Oh, that's nice--
Sean...
Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me.
You're just a boy. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.
Why not?
I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun...
Is that why you didn't write anything else?
Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon?
Yeah.
So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away?
You're right, Will. Any man who takes a forty minute train ride so those college kids can come in in the morning and their floors will be clean and their trash cans will be empty is an honorable man.
What?
Do you want to talk about it?
You're not going to fail me are you?
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.
Over at Tri-tech. One of the jobs Professor Lambeau set me up with. I haven't told him yet, but I talked to my new boss over there and he seemed like a nice guy.
I'm Will.
Here's my number.
What?
The caramel thing is my pick-up line.
It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
Sounds good, where are you now?
I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
Yes you have. You were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss.
Not far from here, South Boston.
Well...
Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another crack at it. Let me take you out.
Then on behalf of my weiner, I'd like to ask for an advance.
C'mon, give me a peek and we'll go to the battin' cages.
It's important that I learn this.
I guess. I don't know. How do you remember your phone number?
I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
One, because I have a job here and two because I live here--
Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--
Fuck you! You think I want this? That money's a burden to me. Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back. I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father. But that's life. And I deal with it. So don't put that shit on me. You're the one that's afraid.
What about your twelve brothers?
I don't want to "save" you. I just want to be with you. I love you. I love you!
You know what I want to hear? I want to hear that you don't love me. If you tell me that, then I'll leave you alone. I won't ask any questions and I won't be in your life.
You trying to tell me how to run my own business?
Joe!
But ef you *do* whup me, I swear you better not ever go to sleep again, because the minute you go to sleep, or you're settin' down, or your back's turned, I'm gonna knock you belly-up with a bucket.
Don't hold me so tight.
That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.*
Gallon or two?
Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?
Okay. Go on.
Banana cream, pineapple cream, chocolate cream--and apple.
That's not your affair. Name.
Got a warrant?
No, I never. What?
It don't matter. Ever since I lost the sperit it looks like I just as soon go one way as the other.  I'll go your way.
I'll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the Holy Sperit I ever seen. He go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time. Fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. Well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. They was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' I give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that.
Hide in the willows. If it's awright to come back I'll give you four high whistles.
Casy! What you doin' here?
Then what are you doin' this kind a thing for--against your own people?
Yeah.
This here's a strike.
No, ma'am. They ain't no work hereabouts. Pa's in tryin' to sell some stuff to get gas so's we can get along.
California.
Well, you just turn around and walk the other way.
I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry.
You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.
Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think?
Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy.
I was afraid they'd stop us an' wouldn't let us cross. But I tol' Granma. I tol' her when she was dyin'. I tol' her the fambly had ta get acrost. I tol' her we couldn't take no chances on bein' stopped.
Tom--you tol' me--you promised you wasn't like that. You promised me.
You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to keep clear.
They know what--this fella looks like?
I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.
It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.
But who done it?
Are you crazy?
Can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him or he'll git so mad he'll hurt his self.  Reckon we could git him *drunk*?
I shore would like to stop here a while an' give her some res' but we on'y got 'bout forty dollars left. I won't feel right till we're there an' all workin' an' a little money comin' in.
I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.
Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
Tom, I jus' don't feel like nothin' a tall. Without him I jus' don't wanta live.
I wisht it was day.
Keep qui'te, will ya! Shet your mouth!
In the corporate offices.
You're so funny...
--Stop it--
I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.
Computer guy.
Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?
Yep.
Bad experiences.
Unbelievable.
Here. Let me put these in some rubbing alcohol.
A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
You don't understand...
Tell me about your vision of the reunion.
You know where I live?
Do you like the people you work with?
It's only natural....
Like a union?
Like a club. Work less, make more.
But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.
Not bad. You?
Hey, Bob.
That sounds pretty interesting...
He using her.
Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.
Would you describe their position as inflexible?
There's nothing to be done about it.
Never enough.
Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
You don't have a headache. I have a headache.
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
You too.
No. You drove us here.
I have to get my head back into my work.
Work's good for the soul.
See you in ten years.
Good evening, Mr. Blank.
Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong.
How's that?
I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek.
Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the same old sell-out baby-boomer, exploiting the oppressed I got shot for at Kent State. But why don't we have a drink and forget the whole thing?
So what are you doing with your life now, son?
Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...
Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
Well, that'll be a little complicated --
Don't be so sure it's my last. There are a few people back home I'd like to put under a red hot iron.
Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world?
You lived in Chicago?
I thought you lived in Chicago?
You too.
You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...
Poor thing.
Feel good?
What?!
I won't ask you to.
Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us...
I brought it to you in the hospital.
Mom?
Yeah?
Fine.
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
Well, now you know what it feels like.
FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!
Because you are... one of the most... incredible, bravest, most beautiful woman I have ever met. The efforts you make. Your courage and your dignity.  I don't know where you got it? I honestly don't know how I would have handled all this if I were you.
Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home.
Go ahead...
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
Sure... What's Grace up to?
No, I'll go. You stay... In case she wakes up.
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way...
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
No, that's not what I said. I'm not a dictator. If you feel you should come, then come. Just do whatever you think is right.
I know. We miss you too.
About what?
No. I am a "tubab."
Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.
Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow.
Always did. I think she favored him a little. You tend to when you have more than one, even though you love 'em all the same.
I'd love to go there one time...
Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
Guess you don't have to figure it out until you go home.
No, no, I'll go -- just give me a list.
Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case?
Probably best. You may want to shoot yourself half way to Ohio.
Our daddy raised Pure Herefords.
Twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch.
I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.
I don't know if I can.
Why don't we just cut through the woods?
You just showing off for her!
How much longer do you think?
I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
Waste the dude.
How are you going to take care of the cops?
Maybe I should just go to the bathroom or something.
Again?  Yeah sure.
Super hero like even.
That's far out!
Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what's the Da Vinci virus?
Curtis.
No. No one special.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
I told you, I don't play well with others.
Never heard of you. Done anything?
I got photographic memory.  It's a curse!  Lisa!
Fucked if I care, man.
Look, even if you had the passwords, it'll take you ten minutes to get in, and you've still gotta find the files, man, I mean, the cops will have you in... five minutes.
I'm Crash Override.
It's cool, I'm just looking.
If I win, you become my slave.
You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
You're not gonna win.
Uh, hold on...
I have to tell you something.
How?
Sorry, I can't help you, okay?
Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool?  A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
Good.
What's happening?
Cancer, brain... Brain Cancer?
Relax, Burn, he's my guest.
Yeah! You better figure out what's on that disc, cause we're being framed. It's in that place where I put that thing that time?
I created Mister da Vinci so we could call in the Secret Service. So they'd arrest the hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we can't do on our own.
Sh, sh sh sh sh.
You're late.
We've been better.
Who's that?
Get back!
Go!
Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.
Mom, I'm on a diet. You want an oinker for a daughter?
How do you know their not?
Because the lights are all out.
Four plus Myers.
Drive Carefully.
Got it Earl.
I can't sleep.
But I thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating.
Yeah, hurry up.
I thought you said you were ready.
Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.
You knew. You just didn't care.
Hi Jamie.
You won't look pushy.
Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
Do you?
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl.
Sort of.
All right Rachel, you stay by this radio. The state boys will send word once their in route. When that word comes you go tell deputy Logan.
We just talked.
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
Fun-ny. See you.
I forgot my chemistry book.
Annie, was that you?
Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.
What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
I'd say you must have the wrong number.
I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
Yes, you can.
He went out drinking beer with Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late. YOU'LL have to call him tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
Go get me a beer.
Are you sure?
Yeah, sure.
Could have...
Looks like to me you're just plain scared.
Three blocks down. Get in the car and go up that other street and then back down here. I'm going up the block.
Okay. Later.
Sure.
Can we watch the monster movies?
Sure.
See you.
But king Arthur was always your favorite.
I'm so embarrassed. I couldn't face him...
What about the rest of my comic books?
No...
Promise?
I promise.
Can we make the Jack-O-Lantern now?
There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed.
Of course not.
If you say so.
I see.
What does that mean?
You don't have anything to worry about. He hasn't spoken a word in 15 years.
Move it!
Uh --
I mean, I've looked everywhere.
Okay.
You're joking.
Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it.  He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
We're actresses.
Really?  Is the food that bad?
Yes.
Oh, okay.
Mm-hm.
You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
Well, are...are they big?
Okay.  Why, all of a sudden, is the sketch dirty? 
Oh, I don't know.  My unemployment checks are running out.  Um, I was thinking of taking some courses at Columbia with the last of my savings.
You're out looking here?
How about you?
Yes, I do.
No, I don't have time.
And-and maybe, um...maybe we could discuss it sometime.
I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up.
Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
Yes, but you, you do care about me.
I almost didn't.
I want you to take care of me... And I love when you do things to me.
If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
Aren't they great?
Why not?
Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
Are you in love with someone else?
No!  But you keep asking these, these awful questions.  My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!
No.
Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke.
We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman...
Absolutely.
...you're such a puzzle.  So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else. 
Based on what?  You never even see him.
I can't take this anymore.
I'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago.
Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?
You know... 
You've outdone yourself.
No.
Oh, no!  I mean, everyone thinks things like that.
She's going through a really rough time right now.
I think he'll find that satisfying.
H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
Wow!
Well, then a third opinion.
I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
With a, with a stranger?  With a--
No!  I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention.  He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young...at heart.
Now, Holly's not shy.
No, no, we decided!
Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
I should get a garter belt.
Oh, perfect!  He reminds me of Ichabod Crane.  His Adam's apple keeps jumping up and down whenever he gets excited. HANNAH  Listen.  He's a lot better than your ex-husband.  He's got a good job.  Would you light those, please? He's-he's-he's not a dope addict or anything.
Here.  Be careful with those.
Oooo.
Singing?
Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...
Well, no...I-I know, I just, uh... No, I-I, eh, you know, I, I didn't, I didn't know you sung.
You know.
Yeah, although it's put an end to the Stanislavski Catering Company. Which is why I have to speak to you. And...  you're gonna get impatient, but...I have to borrow some more money. 
Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.
Listen, you are witnessing genius!
You want some?
Jesus...  I'm glad Hannah got us together. You know, she's got a great instinct for people.  Really.
Right.  Yeah.  I had a...
Yeah.
...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.
Well...
Really?
What...what about your script?  So what's it about?
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?
Y-you used to-- Oh, no!  Yeah, I care.  You used to be so ambitious and...  God, you really liked it?!
Hi.  How you doin'?
I just want a salad.  You really think I'm a loser, don't you?
You know, you've been picking on her ever since she came in here. Now just leave her alone for a while!  I'm just suffocating. 
You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?
Uh-huh.
...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
Yes?
You want me to be?
Let's keep it to business, shall we?
You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....
Who called the <u>TV CREWS</u>...?
They got that kind of money?
Atrocious Torture.  Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.
...what a world.
...are you alright, sir...?
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
Good evening, Dr. Lechter.  Thank you for coming.  I am sorry that we could not meet under more pleasant circumstances.
OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it.
No, no, of course not.
...young boys, still...?
Mmm...
And I expect you to.  Let's talk like two medical men 
'fraid it's too late.
Shut up, Starling...
A fellow with five fingers.
...standard issue...
Not for our Doctor Lechter.  This...  Purports to be an x-ray of the hand of a ...white male...mmmm....mmmm...., after the removal of a vestigial sixth digit. Left Hand.  It purports to be the x-ray of Dr. L...
No. 
I don't <u>think</u> so...
Well, then, you're a lucky girl, cause that baby's gone to be your family.  ...I've got an appointment....
And how do we account for the interest of such a charming man, an interest in Torture?
Well, perhaps sometime we...
...how so?
You have taken over his offices, is that not so?
Of course, <u>in</u> his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... Are his personal effects still at the Palazzo?
You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
Why did you look at me that way?
How so?
It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel?
Well, if you will excuse me.  Madame. What a pleasure.
Back to <u>America</u>...?   When first we met you'd just returned from America.
Yes.  Franklin, you can't live there anymore.  With Mama and Shirly and Kittykat.  You have to go away.
Due respect, you <u>don't</u>, sir, your precious Joint Operation.  FBI, ATF, DC SWAT, it's alphabet <u>soup</u>, we don't have the same Radio Freqs, we don't...
I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...?  Do right and you'll live through this.
Freud, do you know...?  Freud psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon.
...after you' re dead.  AND WHEN I GIVE THE WORD, do you understand...when I give the <u>word</u>...
Alcohol.  Where both its life-enhancing And its life destroying qualities...  ...not unlike some Hindu <u>God</u>...
Well.  <u>Excellent</u>... I'm...
The Multi-Jurisdiction Task Force:  read alphabet soup, for the continued pursuit, and in preparation for the apprehension of the fugitive, Evelda Drumgo.  The man's hazing you.
I'll tell you what:  I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota. 
...something about my <u>father</u>...?
Because...?
What shape is the scar?
I want the money.
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
Is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that...
Thank you.
Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"...
I can't remember.  I've got to make some money.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. Because, you know, you can't understand.
..and <u>humiliation</u>?  What is this new job they've...?
That's right.
That if <u>decision</u> were a useful tool, you wouldn't <u>be</u> here.  Why are you here...?
I..
Because we must leave the past <u>in</u> the past.    Ah.  And here we have artifacts of, yes, my own encounter with him...
And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
Why are you...don't stop...why?
That's it, Adam, pretend it's one of those arcade things, the tighter you squeeze, the more of a man you are...Ooh, that's it.
Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?
You are the prince of the darkness.
Uh, yeah, that's...wow.
Man, it's not like I don't know about women. I had this babysitter...
"or you're going to get it?" Wow, first week of camp. Promise me you won't try moving so fast with Wichita.
They're the easiest to shoplift, okay?  No woman should have to pay for something forced-on-her-without- choice by Nature...what's the matter, Hayley?                                                     ] ] As they playfully bicker, Hayley gazes, with a tinge of               ] longing, to Vanessa and the Bombshellettes parked at a picnic         ] table, flirting up a storm with their cute-boy-counterparts.          ] ] TALIA                                              ] What do you think--it's the Last                            ] Night of Camp Dance.                                        ] ] PIXEL                                              ] What are you saying?

I know what you mean. But it doesn't put me in too great a position...
Gee, thanks.
It's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask "What's your major?" I hate that.
So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
Come on you jerk. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.
Very very. The photographs?
Well, you better move Holden out of the way or he's going to get spewed.
Oh shit, yeah.
Yeah, I just got back.
Heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town.
Yeah, where's your urge to purge?
Hey now, if you were happy every day of your life, you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host.
I don't know. Should you?
Killing her won't solve anything.
Yeah, great.
No shit, sherlock. I can't believe it. I just killed my best friend.
And your worst enemy.
I can do Heather's handwriting as well as my own.
"To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me."
This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.
Don't move! I'll get him back!
I did not want them <u>dead</u>.
I could be up for that. I've already started underlining <u>meaningful</u> passages in Heather's copy of Catcher in the Rye, if you know what I mean. So are we on?
I think I know Heather a bit better than you, okay? If she was going to slash her wrists, the knife would be absolutely spotless.
You don't get it, do you? Society nods its head at any horror the American teenager can think to bring upon itself. We don't need gloves and does anyone really care about exact handwriting?
You want to wipe the slate clean as much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me. You have a purpose though! Remember? Let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven.
You've got power, Veronica. Power I didn't think you had. The slate is clean.
Let's kick his ass.
What did your <u>boyfriend</u> say when you told him you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio?
I guess.
Any contestants worth mentioning?
Superb.
I'm lost. You don't get enough attention, you get too much attention. Which is it? Where are your shoes?
Where is he? Where's J.D.?
People just don't take the name Heather seriously. They should, shouldn't they?
What's that?
sighs as HONORA puts the frying pan on the stove.
I just want to be on my own for a while.
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!
I'm educating myself!
It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.
I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
gives her a sympathetic look.
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
looks startled at the outburst.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.
Don't . . . please! Please, don't!
Daddy says the Bible's a load of bunkum!
I couldn't have done it without you, Charles.
John has fallen in love with me!
They'll blame the bloody housekeeper. She nicks stuff all the times!
I need my sodding parents' consent.
Easy there Trevor. You need to relax.
I'm all over it.
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
I understand, I think. Other women?
Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.
What was it?
Hospital? You haven't been to the hospital since uh...
Yeah, how's that?
Gwen.
Ambrose. I know.
How do you think you got this job, cock?  Mmm. I'm still tingling all over from our little midnight swim.
Uh... eighty two?
Really? Why?
It's okay it was just a nightmare that's all.
Well they'd have to prove it in a court of law for one thing-
I don't work here.
Music to my ears.
I hear everything. And soon you will know everything. More than you ever wanted I can guarantee that. But I want you to think for a minute first. Think about all you've seen. All the clues you've been given.
But that's what I need. To be sure... to be absolutely sure...
Whew. You bounce right back don't you?
The car accident? Any of this ringing a bell?
Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it's about... what we did together last night.
In bad weather, yeah.  Mostly I camp out in the woods.  I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up.
I don't recall saying I didn't want a million bucks...
You should go in.  You're risking your life again...
I'm not saying I hate sick people or anything but I hate being <u>around</u> them if you know what I mean.  There <u>you</u> go, you <u>inspire</u> this kid to <u>live</u>.  I probably woulda vomited on him.
--but there's a lot of it still left, uh, Bernie.  Almost half.
I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.
Yeah, I been calling in sick.  They think I got the flu.
Involved!  Christ!  She attached my goddamn paycheck!  Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?  You know what I mean.  Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...
I think you should visit your son. And try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job.  You need to create the impression of a responsible, decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once.
TAXI!  HEY, TAXI!  Well, at least I'm gonna get my goddamn million bucks.  TAXI FOR CHRISSAKE!
You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?
You mean like Bubber?  The hero?
The thing is, Chick.  I'm goin' down.
I...
I had to explain your tendancy to "exaggerate", How you were actually "in country" all of two weeks and how you killed about as many people as the other clerk-typists in your outfit, no more, no less...
I'm going to apologize to Bubber?
Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
Thanks.  Thanks, pal.
...unworthy of the adoration.  We all do.
You're a celebrity, John.  People are going to want to please you... or use you... or both.
You did save my life!  And it's <u>me</u>! I'd be taking advantage of <u>you</u>! I'm a reporter, John, an experienced professional...  I...
You're lucky, Chucky, you... OW!
This sofa is a lethal weapon.  The springs... are... the springs... what...?
The story behind the story, the ugly scandal behind the falling millionaire, the dirt, you mean.
A "mystery guy!"  "Not a passenger." Who?
He'll do it.  You really-should have talked to him first.
She's flying to New York.  She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...
She can't quit.
For ten more minutes they love him, Wally.  I'm sick of him and I'm always about ten minutes ahead of the public.
I... I saw him out the window.
It's when you say, "Everybody else cheats why shouldn't I?"  But I don't -- I don't <u>hate</u> -- him. I... loved him once, Joey.  Very much.  I just got... tired.  Maybe it wasn't all his fault.  He... What's happening?  Oh, my God...
Never reach out!
You didn't?
He's pretty... remarkable.
What about?
I didn't ask him.
Who?
I'm Bernard, by the way.  Those are cool Reeboks, Neil.  They're real new, aren't they?
Wife, girlfriend or mother?
All right then.  That's important, isn't it?  -- For you to be in an "up" environment.  I'm saying you should literally take that as your <u>base</u>, do you know what I mean? It's something positive that you've accomplished -- even if you were forced by circumstance -- something for you to build upon.
Listen, no one ever said expressing yourself to the opposite sex is easy, but when the time comes, you have to do it and you <u>hope</u> the outcome will be good for both of you. You come out of solitary and you rejoin the human race, as difficult as that sometimes can be.
It's not going to happen unless you make it happen, my friend. You're going to have to assert yourself a little bit more.  <u>Show</u> your affection.
I should.
You have to put yourself out there a bit more.
Well, you'll just have to <u>make</u> her understand.
I was alone a lot as a child.  No one to compete with.  My parents ensured that I found happiness in the smallest things.  When you're all alone it's your own world, you don't have to take orders from anybody.  You don't necessarily believe the stories people tell you.
"Find a penny, pick it up, all day long you'll have good luck!"
A man scared me.
Why are you mad at each other?
Well, that's what happens with grownups, too.
The same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything.  He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss.
Don't drive yourself crazy.  It's probably nothing.
I can't help it if my homework is torn to shreds three times a week by someone <u>much</u> bigger than me</u>.
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
It's very nice, but it's still a little pricey for us.
Honey, I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having.  This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With <u>nothing</u>.
He wasn't there.
This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!
Oh, yes, well, you know, when developers remodel a house they often overestimate their costs at first.  It's not like it's been marked down or anything.
What for, dickweed?
Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
We don't have any proof of that.
Congratulations.
A few days ago.
And Brenda?
You sure?
I learned my fill from Romeriz.
That's all?
Yes.
That is what bothers me.
For what?
Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?
I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
That doesn't matter.
I know that for six months you've worked hard and asked for little. That you're a good and honest man. What more need I know?
Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
I'm leaving in the morning.
No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries.  It's a syndicated show out of..
A lucky guess.
Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
Why?  What's going on?
Why?
Is it?
On the back it has--
And the other one -- he is like you?
It will end tonight.
Why?
Someone broke into the cavern last night.
I know, Paul.
Perhaps -- but it comes off none the less.
This cannot be.
The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
I can take care of myself.
And I you.  Go now.  Let me walk to heavens door alone.
Yes.
Why won't you ever let anyone help you?
You also have a power, Conner.  It is why you have survived.
No.  The money, please.
Get to work.
I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan.
I'll make the call.
Am I talkin' raghead?!  I want your car! <u>Gimme the goddamned keys</u>!
We should give up.  All we're doing is making it worse.
We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you.
Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door!
<u>Look</u> at him!  I think he's dying!
Find something:  Extension cords, rope, wire--we'll have to tie them tight.
Have Louise run the name 'Mars Krupchek' through DMV and NCIC.  Tell her to list the tattoo as an identifier.
If things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end.
You worry about your end.  I got my side covered.
What hospital?
I also have a couple of million in cash. Call Sonny Benza.  Ask if I can keep it.
I think you got no choice.
You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
You go, Thomas.  You get out, and I'll stay with Daddy.
Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know.
I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.
Yes.
Another minute.  Please --
You have her cell number?
Don't crowd the house.  The alpha's a kid named Rooney.  He's amped up and volatile.
I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
Then I think we should wait.  Do you agree?
Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!
-- then when you get him, you damn near assault the man in the ambulance!  <u>What</u> <u>is going on</u>?
What's my name?
Not until the man calls.
They nailed the windows.  I can't get'm open.
Okay.
Charles G. Benza.  They're coming!
Yes.
The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
Name a price.
They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister.
Where is she?
That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
Oh, Paul, talk to the coat check, please.
What did they say?
Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
I understand General, but when I last talked to the president of Sabena he promised me that anyone who helped protect Belgian property would be rewarded.
Get in.
What do you mean, General?
I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now?
I committed no war crimes.
At least.
What is it?
Fuck you.
I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.
Let me ask you Mr. Manager, do you notice a smell of cockroaches? If I were to leave this room, I'm sure I could find this smell. I know people who could cleanse it. But maybe it doesn't bother you? Why is that? Are used to this smell? Not me, I need a clean room to escape it.
Don't worry. I have a job this morning. I must go to visit my good friend George Rutagunda. You know George?
I saw the sign.
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
I would never do that.
That will take time.
Show me your ID
What cards?
Homework?
You could have asked for a favor.
I sent them home. Go and call them.
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
What!
He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then.
What for Paul.
No, no.
To be closer. So that I could marry you.
We have to get out of here Tatiana.
Please, please try one more time.
No.
I will follow on the next plane. Go.
No, I don't want you going on the street.
On the street.
Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.
It's complicated. But don't worry --
Not at all!
-- the "Saturation Chamber." Where he wanted to put me.
Is she alright?
-- what was he doing here?
Yeah, me too.
Nonsense! Just bad press. All the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents.
Take the gun.
Prove it.
Prove it how?
Adrenaline -- in your bag, Blackburn, you must have --
-- yeah, we did that --
-- not a chance -- there's too much weirdness down there I don't think even bullets are gonna stop.
He's dead...?
You've got your own TV show?
It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.
Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch --
-- in the act.
-- oh, for chrissake, that's a given; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here --
-- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new.
-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
My wife. Where were we?
Like what?? This isn't supposed to be happening!!
-- even if I give you a million as well?
Thank God -- I was afraid I'd be lynched without a quorum.
Oh, sorry. Detail I guess I forgot to mention. You die, you lose. Your check gets divvied-up by those still amongst the living.
I'll try not to remember to warn Evelyn.
Well, I can't, sweetheart.
He must've beaten us all here!
Keep talking, I'll find you!
The style of dress on the girl... it coincides with the era Marion Foster killed herself.  Who else could have gone in there and done something like that?
Well, I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us.
A few years older, perhaps.
I'm sorry.
The knife destroys the evil and saves the soul of the possessed.
Well I bet you they're happy.
We're going to go someplace new.
Go to your room!  Now!
I want this one, daddy.
That's great, honey.
Don't be afraid!
Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.
She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.
Who?
What about keeping an open mind?
Voodoo stick?  It's nothing like that Will.  You're just being cynical.
I'm sure this sounds crazy to you.
She has a...friend.  Colleen.
What?
Did you know her very well?
So what should we do, father?
And you...are?
Perhaps I'll see you in church.
So what does that have to do with Aubrey!  Where is she!
Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.
That is the story of my life.
What can we do?
Your apartment.
The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...
Oh yeah ...
What is it?
Jeez, I've never owned anything.  I haven't even had a room of my own since I was fifteen years old.
Cool.  I read a book once.  It was like all these people discovering who they used to be.  You know, like reincarnation?  It was really good.  You ever read that?
No.  He knows it won't.  It was his final act of love and part of him knows that and part of him doesn't yet.
Would you know this store again?
Sure.  Why?
Here!  Here!  Pull over!
And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else.  Get dressed.  Get out.
Well ... of course I have.  I've thought.  I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible.  You really hurt me ...
Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over?  You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.  Just see how we both feel?
Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?
Hey, you didn't fuck it up with me.  You know that.  It was my fault, babe, it really was.  And you know I'm sorry. And I'm sorry to see you upset now.  I hate to see you in pain like this.
Guards come exactly every three minutes....
Hey, get this irritable guy a cappuccino.  I gotta go be a boss.
Hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.
"He kicks up at anything he hears.
Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece. Da Vinci's "Sforza," an equestrian model of a never executed statue. I consider it to be the prize of tonight's auction of objets d'equestrian.  Horse things.
Why try?
Don't worry, we'll get it...
That's the best kind.  A wise woman once said "Polite conversation is rarely either."
Never, why do you ask?
Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand....
Oh, you read that.
Secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to.  There's a place two blocks east of here. Enzo's.  Say 10:30.
I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...
I told you not to call me Hudson. The only people who called me that were the nuns at...
Holy sh-h--things are going to get very interesting, very fast. Da Vinci would be proud of you.
Actually he never told us what it was.
Well, that said, the last ingredient in the recipe is in, get this, you're gonna die, the Kremlin.
Yes.
It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash- crash.  Financial Empires will crumble-crumble.
Bastard!  If you were a true American.
You just might.  I'm the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it.  At the time, I was bald with a beard, no moustache, and I had a different nose, so if you don't recognize me, I won't be offended.
Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.
Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
Lumbago.
He didn't offer you money.
At any rate I arrived in town not ten days ago, full of dreams and aspirations, anxious to make my way in the world --
Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
Please! Norville!
...Why don't I just type this up...
Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean.
Oh. Nothing, really, just... the more timid investors are no longer running for cover.
I understand that you're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts. I'm not that skilled as president. Oh sure, I put up a big front --  -- not that everyone's buying it.
You don't say.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys --
Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought she said, Mamie --
Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --
Consider this my resignation --
Sez me! Amy Archer. Why is he an Idea Man -- because Hudsucker says he is? What're his ideas? Why won't they let anyone interview him?...
It's about a dimwitted editor who --
Daddy, it's like I been tellin' ya --
What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
This I know, Benny.
And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out!
Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --
But he told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me. What gives!
Say, that was a swell idea!
Norville.
Sir?
Yes sir...
Barnes! Where the hell have you been! And where's my voucher?!
But look, I'm president of the company now and I --
I --
Well, I made the dean's list.
Well... I'm for it...
How's that, Sid?
She is!
She must have been beautiful.  What happened to her, Alma?
No, miss.  He's just as he was in the beginning -- on the front part of an enormous boat.
Oh, Mrs. Rand --
Use your influence with Paul.  Ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table.
Haven't I?  I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here.
I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been "mindless"...
I asked you to let me explain. It's a long story.  And not an easy one --
Perhaps not.  But I did come here and I found it was so simple to let the gods speak through me. Once started, it seemed such an easy way to do good.  I should have known there was no easy way to do good, Betsy.
I've never heard of a cure.
Is this disease common in the tropics?
A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know.
No -- she just runs the place. She's everything else -- amazing woman, mother.  You'll like her.
That doesn't sound like him.
You can't really believe that.
No, thank you.  Tomorrow's time enough for you to begin work.
And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?
I know what you went through tonight.  I kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here, violently.
She is alive, Mr. Holland -- that's all.
You know why.  You saw it the other night at the piano.  You turned away from me.
I guess I'll wait until I'm home, Mrs. Rand.
Of the nature of Mrs. Holland's illness.  And, of course, the events which led up to it.
I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
-- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --
Rough day. Good night.
Um, yes.
I'm just sad Ben -- I mean it was... you were, but, you know. I just don't know...
Stuffed and baking.
What do you mean?
Elena, what are you're talking about?
I'm not surprised.
Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we'll be right back, Dot.
I think we're here and we don't have to stay -- we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home.
I'm fine dad.
You're boring me. I have a husband. I don't particularly feel the need for another.
Have I noticed anything? I'm not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her.
What are you talking about?
If I were a fascist I would have sent you to one of those Southern military academies a long time ago. Now get to bed.
Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
You know, dah--
But dad, you guys truly hated each other, I mean really hated each --
-- 73
-- 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, Ben, be a man and just get it over with. I would have if I'd had the chance.
Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the IRS, and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff --
It was all junk!
Ben, I'm going to Florida. I hate Thanksgiving and I hate the cold. I have a new nurse. She's a negro, she weighs three hundred pounds, and I've decided to leave my entire estate to her.
Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
What the hey. Let's go for a drive.
Phone's out. I hope the pipe's --
I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.
What sort of problems are you planning exactly?
Forget how to ride a bike.
You're saying that Christ is the child, and --
All well and good -- But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in?
Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?
Paul, let me enlighten you about something. You and I exist on two opposite sides of a great existential divide, that being your pathetic virginity on the one hand and my astonishing number of sexual conquests on the other. I'm off to get laid. See you.
Flame on, asshole.
Let's see!
Just be careful.
The Idiot?
If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot.
What is it?
You know Libbets, I really feel, you know, like a real connection to you --
And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.
Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath together?
Geometry?
Sure.  Twinkie?
Tell Sandy? What?
Wendy!
Huh?
I'm sorry if I got you into trouble. Maybe we don't have to, you know... unless you really want to.
Yeah.
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.
Right.
Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p.o.'d.
Just thought I'd stop by.
Okay.
About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.
No.
I'm going to the hospital to talk to him now.  You get the search party together.  No fewer than thirty people.  I'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes.  Don't waste any time.
That's right.
You know I remember that.
Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
You don't have to be involved, Will.
No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
I'm not expecting anyone.
What did he look like?
What is it?
Kay Connell.  Did you love her?
I told you I don't remember.
She didn't tell me.
What are you doing in this shit-hole town?
What was?
Yes down at the station.
Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.
I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have.
Surely you know the one who made you...
I knew. I rescued you, didn't I? From the terrible dawn.
You dress me like a doll. You make my hair like a doll. Why?
Not you my dear.
Then I hope its a beautiful woman with endowments you will never possess.
The way I learn everything. By watching you.
Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
Tell me why...you've got to tell me...
It is! Take the back stairwell -
Nonsense all right. But something tell me it's going to be the strangest nonsense we've ever seen.
He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.
It's only mortal death.
The sun will destroy the blood I've given you. Every tissue, every vein. The fire in this lantern could do that too.
Anything is possible. But just try it for a week. Come into New Orleans and let me show you some real sport!
Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!
I respect life, don't you see? For each and every human life I have respect.
What do you imagine you are Louis?
Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
What are you saying?
CLAUDIA!!!
I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!
You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
Yes. I remember...
Saw you in the street outside. You seemed interesting. Is this where you live?
I'm a vampire.
We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
The same way you do it. A series of simple gestures. Only I moved too fast for you to see. I'm flesh and blood, you see. But not human. I haven't been human for two hundred years.
And did you lose her? Did she go?
No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?
Fictions, my friend. The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman... So we repaired to Paris...
My daughter...
Who? Who is here?
Phones went down a few minutes ago.
Stupid. What were you thinkng?
Yeah, right -- whatever.
Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.
Julie, you left four messages... Four.
No, I'm the King of the World.
They never found the body.
You sure?
I'm fine.
It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna get better.
I'm okay.
Are you sure?
Right. Planes get hit by lightning. They get hit by meteors. They hit other planes.
It's...him.
Just for a minute, baby. I got something I wanna tell you.
Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. Tropical!
We gotta get out of here. Now.
Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring.
I'll go up and take a look at the General - perhaps sit with him.
I'm afraid so. There were rumors people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions.
M~ father will take care of it.  Pappa is wonderful! No matter what happens, he makes me feel perfectly safe.  I could never leave him. I should be utterly helpless by myself.
Last night Dr. Drossos -- today you or I -- oh, no, Oliver, it can't be you, I couldn't stand it.
In the morning -- go. I'll not die until then - I'll not die  I'll watch - they shall not hurt you.
They shall not hurt you
You have forgotten my last name?
You wouldn't tell that 
I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in - entombed  imprisoned..
Her family name?
Maybe you've got the wrong crypt  after all it's twenty years when you wore last here.
I will be glad to leave this island. It has too much of that old dark world about it. I will be glad to leave it and that girl 
Oh, now  now look here 
How did she die?
Are you running a business or a charity ward?
So I suppose I should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me.
Who?
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow  you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
Why? Don't they believe in angels?
I don't know how you know these things, but tell me  where is she?
If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
Oh, wonderful!
I want you to take a good look at that face.
George Bailey.
No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
Sir . . . If I should accomplish this mission  I mean  might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir  and people are beginning to talk.
Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.
Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore? . . .
Well, this house ain't been lived in for twenty years.
Yes, but he's got the faith of a child  simple. Joseph, send for Clarence.
Goodbye, Sam.
Hmmm . . .
Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?
Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.
And all's fair in love and war?
Yes, sir.
No.
Ummmm . . .
Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
Yeah  yeah . . . sure I will.
I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.
This way.
I'd like to do that.
Have you notified the police?
What is it  a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
I'll take chocolate.
Well, why don't you say it?
In that place?
Come on, tell me.
Well, then, sit down.
Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? This is what I wished for.
Thanks for dropping around.
Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
I didn't want to marry anybody else in town. I want my baby to look like you.
I don't care. It's George's tux.
You forgot something.
What?
Sure, sure I am.
Well, I don't know....
How fast is enough?
Good.  It's terrible.
I hope that's the cousin.
What the hell.  Did your mom put all this together?
What the hell, we're steering for it.
Aren't you off-duty?
That one -- from the wreck.  You brought it up, did you look inside it?
Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay?
But I signed for the boat.  You' re not authorized any more.
Got it.
Do I have to?
What about tennis?  Riding? fixing up old cars?  Bartending?
Okay, okay.
Not till next year.
You want to come here a minute?
Hey, come on....
First things first.
The what?
But that's what we're here to find out, right?
You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay?
Is there one in these waters?
Sound.  Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.
Not necessarily.  These wounds could've been inflicted 30 miles out to sea, or more.  None of them are immediately fatal.  Currents could've carried the body 10 miles further.
Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate?  Send out signals, or something?  You know, take revenge, sense an enemy....
Santos' place.
He wanted a job, he's got one.  I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.
We're alone.
No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.
Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke.
Martin, this is kind of an official meeting
What?
I'm okay, baby, I'm here.  It's okay....
Waiting for Andy.
Great.
Ready?
Okay, okay, coming....
Tina Wilcox.
Doesn't hurt to ask.  Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
None at all.  I wonder what the Brebner twins are doing tomorrow night.
Just like this.
Wait a minute.  Promise me something.
Mike?  Our Mike?
What the hell is it?
Is there something I don't know about?
I'll be right there.  Wait up.
No way.  Everybody's going sailing. If you don't want to take me, just say so.
You do everything your parents tell you?
How was dive class?
Yeah.  Go on, beat it.
So?  So?
Get the hose!  We've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him!
He's going with you, Doctor.
Sure am.
What is it, 97 days?
Okay, bye.
I don't know.  I can't understand it.  Something's bothering them.
Not enough loving.
Take a deep breath and hold it.
That's cute, Kathryn.  Real cute.
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
No, I don't want to leave now. I'm having too good a time... Of course I'm coming!  You'd think you're gonna leave me?
Yes.
Here.
Bracelets.
Thank you.
No.
What's up?
I need more pressure in the shark tank.
Okay.
No,  I'm not going through there.
I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long!
You two go!  I'll call Calvin!
Michael, you're not going down there.
I want that shark, Kathryn.
Only to myself.
Nobody told me.
Thanks for helping.
We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.
Believe me, I am.
She, Mister Hutton.
The net would have to be secured by the intake passage.
Someone's looking for you.
How you doing, Kelly?
I'm Neo-Senephrened out.  Think I'm catching a cold.
I don't know, it depends.
Goes back to when I was a kid. Mike's okay, he's gotten over his fears, but I haven't.  I can't even drink it.
Come on!  Check this out!
Can hardly wait to do it again.
Hold still, damn it!
Remember, skiers stay up longer.
That?
Hey.
Thanks.  Bullshot.
Yeah, we'll find something for you.  Shoveling shark shit or something.
He needs a haircut.
Yeah, right.
Who's grown up?
Gee, it's good to see you!
This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.
Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas.  In one of those chapels.  He can meet us there.
Yeah, he'll really go for that.
I don't want to.  I want to swing....
Because....
I don't know...You...I don't know.
How could you do that?  Your own daughter....
Where's my mother?
Serves you right.  Will you please stop....
I'm on the phone....
Good.
What's going on?
Where's the lady who brings the soda?
Thank you....
It's not nice to be evasive.
You guys must be starving....
Don't be such a Grandma...I was always climbing something....
I'm fine....
No more sharks.  I'll stay for another week, then....
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
Yes you can....
How come it bumps up and down when there's no road?
I fly elephants for smugglers....
Still tagging conch?
You too, Michael....
You tagging them...?
I'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen....
If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak....
Shit....
Funny, Jake...Funny.
Mom....
The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his....
We need it to eat electronics, man ...Not you.  Get it on me....
I'm the one who wanted to study it....
Gone to Ben Masters' place.  Cow tipping.
Oh no--
No, Jakie, no. I-I-I-
Yeah?
I'm afraid it's the "van" again.
I think you're here all day.
Think I'll lay down with him. Only way I'll get outta here.
Not too good in daylight ..
Maybe?
O.K. and I'm not in love with this fukker? That's how I feel about him.
I think I got something - twenty two years old, dark hair - study- ing mathematics -  - Last seen <u>5 weeks ago</u> ..
I dunno .. I guess this is staff side of the building?
Let me just keep going a while. She might remember something?
Then give me that Zippo.
I was wrong.
I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators ..
We're not <u>here</u>. I don't want the desk to hear us ..
Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
We have a multiple homicide, Sir ..
<u>You</u> put it in there.
No.
There's no one "looking at you" .. There's hardly anyone in here. The only person looking at you, is me.
Ross told me.
Just your age.
Coz you hardly said a word since you got here. But you been thinking pretty loud ..
He don't know that. I didn't.
You do?
I wanna be near you ...
I dunno, Sir. Brought you up a Chevy.
What was she like?
Jerry!  Do something --
Could you just stop moving?
There is something missing here.
No.
Oh come on --
Then you shouldn't have begged me to hire him.
Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.
Absolutely.
Hello?
Sorry, that's my son and the nanny. I had the calls transferred to my home so I could go over your stuff.
Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
Bye you guys. _ 88.
Of course I know --
No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
Thank you.
Good.
Please, if I start talking --
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
You know I don't do "contracts." But'cha do have my word, and it's stronger than oak.
So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it?  Say it with me.
I might call you later!
Very much.
You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
It's a risk.
Tell me, because it's been a month, and she's about to take another job in San Diego.
But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
No.
Beautiful.
Go.  Flee.
Jerry Maguire.  SMI.
It's the death rattle of my singlehood, right? Because I finally see the white picket fence looming and I love it/hate it/love it/hate it/ love it... you're right, I'll know when I see him. Why is it so easy to talk with you?!  Tell me about your fiancee.
Jerry.  You two will be together forever.
Jerry, Rod is very very upset. Tyson, no!
Damn right.
Marcee -- this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock.
I'm fine.  What's up?
Came here to fire you, Jerry.
I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too.
Funny...   I better go to bed.
I'm not putting him down, I just have a commitment to the truth.
Nothing you haven't seen before.
What did you say!
No, it's...
I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
Its not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.
I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night.  Am I right?
Think.
But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
He's not a kill, he's still alive.
What about Eric?
They're here.
Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see...
They never got that big.
We should take it with us to signal any planes.
Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish.
Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
Let me know if I can help, Alan. Youre bad about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime.
A well-accepted theory.
On the island.
Do me a favor. Go back to your parents for a minute, would you?  They look worried.
Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government.
It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
I want to see the nesting ground!
Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
Which one?
Well, is he?
That Richard.
This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.
Come on!
You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new spot.  And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks.
Okay.
To collect my fee.
Isn't it obvious?
Why?
Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back to camp right away.  Leave the other car for us and we'll meet you there in an hour or so.
Where's Kelly?
For sixty seconds, maybe!  Look at this!  You could-
DAMN IT, BE SURE!!
Why did you come here?
Four, counting the one in the chamber.
Think fast, Sarah.
They're pushing us over the cliff.
Oh, no!
Ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army.
Runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait.
You're sure we have to?
What one?
Uh - - about two million.
How am I supposed to transport them?
Shhhhh!
Anybody at all.  Feel free to speak up.
Six weeks?
These are dilated.  Take a look.
A carousel - - and a seesaw.  They all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas.  "I see the fleas, mummy!  Can't you see the fleas?" Clown fleas, high wire fleas, fleas on parade... 
John, John.  John, you're still building onto that Flea Circus, that illusion.  And now you're adding onto it by what you're doing here.  That's the illusion.
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
The Cretaceous.
The - - agility.  You're right!
They were wrong.  Case closed.  This thing doesn't live in a swamp to support it's body weight for God's sake!
Dilophosaurus.
I know.
- - totally incidental  unrelated to the feeding pattern - -
Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
That's right.  But they never attack the same place twice.  They were testing the fences for weaknesses. Systematically.  They remembered.
You can't just stroll down the road, you know.
Like hell it is!
It's anti-nature.
That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
Really?
That's okay.  Listen, give me your hand.
It's just like coming out of a tree house.  Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?
But - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
Amphibian DNA.
Tim, you're going to have to let go of the fence.  Tim! Get down right now.  Get off the fence!  Now!
I must've touched something.  This happens all the time. It must be my fault.  Machines hate me.
I know.
For today, I guarantee it.
Shhh - - I'm right here, Lex.  I'm going to look after you.  I'm going to help your brother.  I want you to stay here and wait for me, okay?
No, I didn't hear anything.  No, we're okay.
Timmy, listen to Dr. Grant!
I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
Shut up!  You're scaring me.  Stop!  You're scaring me.
You want to put in chain saws?
Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years?
I think we're lost.
You have a map.
I know... but we left the main trail... and I can't find any landmarks around here... I've been trying to figure it out but...
Help me with this.
Who is this? What's going on?
What about that other guy?
He... he's here...
Who's there?
Wrong. Jason can't get a fair trial because of _these_.
I always throw that in. It makes the jury feel sorry for the defendant.
Me too. I'm drunk.
Yeah... I think I understand...  You're drunk, too.
Then I'd say we should put Jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. We'll get extra data this time. Video... infrared... the works.
Great.	When can you do it?
Krueger's the greater danger right now. We have to stop him.  _Springwood_. That's where he'll go. That's where he's always gone.	But Springwood's not like Crystal Lake. There's a couple hundred thousand people there. He could be anywhere.
And if he's not?
_Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming.
How long will the effect last?
Let's split up. You take the left side, I'll take the right. We'll meet in front of the Cineplex.
For the moment! You've only got about two minutes left! Hurry! Ruby takes off towards the Cineplex...
Did you?
There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
No, I left it in his office.
Did you see him?
I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
But <u>I'm</u> the messenger.  An error like this damages my credibility.
Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.
Oh, don't they?  I think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own.
You're detestable.
Well, I --
You might find a more athletic hobby -- put some color in your cheeks.
I know.
One of you must be mistaken.
Have you looked?
He would have.  You were his best friend.  A better friend than me.
The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.
And you ...?
I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.
People must think the same of me -- a quiet, dependable person.
Why were you given notice?
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
Now Burgel's one of the authorities?
-- I've just come from the Castle.  It's over.
Why should I believe a man who never believed me?  They're absolutely right, you know -- guilt should never be doubted. It's easier that way.
No -- not this time.
-- Listen to me --
Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
Where you've been employed for seven years.
Would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close?
I'll bear that in mind.
-- Should you happen upon anything that might be relevant.
That the police may have allegiance to something other than truth.
You mean you've actually begun some?
-- You should meet my father.
A mere slip.  Your friend Mr. Raban dealt only with claims that came <u>in</u>, another department being responsible for compensation that goes out -- this is correct?
Of course not.  Only by a Director of the firm.  Who'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets?
You do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. The Directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious.
Oskar.
She went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour -- we watched her changing.
-- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
You're outta your depth here, Miss Darrow!
Father ... Father!
Value? ... Value?
Sun's coming up ...  We've been in the fog for six hours.
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
Jack! This is the archeological find of the century!
This shit is bad luck! Don't you understand? You treat it like a game - two men have already died!
No! Don't!
What a climax to the film - The first white men to set foot on ...  "Skull Island"  Twentieth Century man comes face to face with a ... a ... naked stone age tribe!
) They are now.
Yeah? ... Well, I gave 'em a taste of American lead ... and I don't see 'em coming back for seconds!
Forget it, Denham ... for Godssake
What?
Yes?
Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
I said that.  Well, so you have a choice. You can either feel lonely -- you know, the hate -- or --  So you take a call and go to a hotel room and there's some John you've never seen before, but he wants you. He must, he's paying for it.  And usually they're nervous and that's all right, too, because you're not; you know this thing. And then for a while, boy, they really pay attention, you're all there is.  And it's not real and you don't have to even like them -- you can even hate them, it's all right, it safe -- you know?
No, that's not --
I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me?
Tell me. I'll listen.  I just want you to tell me.
My name's John Klute.
Dew yew hayuv ah-dentifikyshun?
Or you'll get me shoved back in the brig you mean; another month with the bull-dykes.
Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings.  I'm sure this will amuse you; I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or -- well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. Well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with --
Try some other ways. 
Well, I told him I wouldn't - uh - go there any more.  I know it's tough to understand, but it wasn't easy. You see, he was nice to me. I mean, it wasn't just him. I got something out of it too I guess. Anyway, I told him I wouldn't go there anymore.
What?
Don't touch anything.
Those were police laboratory people, they've been over the apartment.
Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it.
You could at least look at me!
They don't scare me any more.
No. I'm sore.
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
How is it back there?
Not Tom. Whoever it was left a kind of souvenir, I told you, in her clothing. Semen. The laboratory got a blood group reading from that. The man was blood type 0; Tom was an AB.
Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients?
Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
No, I'd -- like to be in on it.
It's in the report.
I've just got a few --
What about Grunemann's letters to the girl, everything like that?
If we get anything from the lab, we'll have it by noon. And just think -- all he really had to do was write us a letter.
Inspector we understand your position; ours is a little different. We have an investment in Tom Grunemann. The Company has an investment, and we feel entitled to investigate for ourselves.
Oh, yes.  Won't you come in.
Not particularly.
Right.  One O.J. coming up.
Goodbye.
Can I be excused?  I'm not hungry.
I guess...
C'mon, Billy.  I'm trying to work for God's sake...
I'm sorry.
It's just...I've been catching a lot of flack at the office...
No.
Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?
Yeah?
It's my name too.
Sure.
I don't know.  I hadn't thought much about it.
No, son, I didn't get fired.  I'll tell you what we'll do, okay?  How about if we go to a Burger King and then we watch a little T.V. and then we get packed to go to the country tomorrow. Just you and me...How 'bout that?
Because...Well, that's what he does.  He's a very powerful man.
I'll send your toys there and I'm sure you'll get some new ones.
This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.
Does the witness deny the injury took place?
The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.
Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband?
I make thirty-one thousand dollars a year.
Eight, almost nine years.
Mis-ter Kramer, it's...  ...almost four now.  It's the Friday before Christmas.  Nobody is going to want to--
No.
Congratulations, Mrs. Kramer. You have just rewritten matrimonial law.  You were both divorced, Mrs. Kramer.
You just don't get it, do you?  I - am - really - and - truly - leaving - you.
Okay, I understand and I promise I won't try and stop you, but you can't just go...Look, come inside and talk...Just for a few minutes.
You have?
You've been living here, in the city?
Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--
Ted, do you love him?
Listen, Ted...I just want to tell you, when old man Schmidt retires next year, I've got a pretty
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.
First, there's no such thing as an open and shut case. Especially where custody is involved.  Got it?
The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
Oh, Christ.. .John, there's some- thing I ought to tell you.  My... ah, situation has...changed.  I lost my job.
I'm sure.
Your people are very brave. They are fighting the Chinese. No one can stop them. Not even me.
Khambas are wild men.
I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
The People's Liberation Army pays for all food and lodging.
Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.
We bring greetings from Chairman Mao.
I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.
I miss him too.
Roughly five thousand men.
No. This war is almost over.
Britain chooses not to.
Good day.
Please, come in, so cold.
You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.
He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams.
These are dangerous times. They want the Dalai Lama to lead them.
You, kill me?
We cannot.
These are not human beings. They are worse than ghosts.
How could I ever leave?
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
The land has stayed in the family. We work together. The nobleman is not too bad.
Does he treat you fairly?
Nobody <u>lives</u> on this lake.  it's really <u>his</u> lake now.
They can survive winter.  As long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive,  am I foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name?
If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang around the food source.
I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he <u>is</u> a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine.  This is a grand beast. <u>A</u> <u>grand</u> <u>dragon</u>.  An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive.
Hey!!
<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
Tranq guns down, rifles up!
I never had sex with you!
I'm a civilian!  You don't have any authority--
Guess I finally got bit.
Hank <u>says</u> he's sure.
Well.  You don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u>, why don't--
What?
That's probably good.
Forgive me for trying to be nice.
I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.
Who taught you be be a nurse?
What?  Why... people have been killed, I hardly think I'm having a good time, why would...  Does it show?
I heard something.
<u>I'm</u> <u>not</u> <u>mushing</u> <u>it</u>.
<u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
Calm down.
Take him.
You think?
<u>You</u> <u>gotta</u> <u>be</u> <u>kidding</u>.
The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.
Yes.
Um.  No, no.  Let's go.
I can look at dead things.
You have a thing against museums?
Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
It's just that--
Yes, <u>camp</u>, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents", will there be toilets?
I just let go of it.
<u>Apologize</u>?
You think Jack's handsome?
Well.  He's probably rugged handsome I guess.  Yeah.
Wait.
The somebody else part?
Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
I want you to go there.
I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
Backstabber?
Never cock. Just squeeze.
Pleading with a crazy man, with come all over my face.
Agent Mapp! Thank you!
I'll need the big fingerprint kit... and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU- 5, with film packs and batteries.
Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
Good idea.
Okay, Mr. Yow...
Not yet! - just wait for me.  Maybe in about two seconds.
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
Who's the subject?
I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.
Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.
He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch. That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off. Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun. Never forget fun.
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony.
I think so.
We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
Mmmmm... That's rather slippery of you, Officer Starling. Sit. Please.
Five... so far.
I didn't.
Reasonably so. Yes.
His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...? I didn't kill him, merely tucked him away. Very much as I found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments. You'd have him under "Missing Person" - which, in poor Raspail's case, could hardly be more true.
Who can say...? Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.
Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? Fucking you?
The significance of the moth is change. Caterpillar into cocoon into beauty... Billy wants to change, too, Clarice. But there's the problem of his size, you see. Even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one...
No. Tell me why.
The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual.
How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case?
We don't reckon time the same way, Clarice. This is all the time you'll ever have.
Later, listen, I'll -
No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...
I took one lamb. And I ran away, as fast as I could...
Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.
Dr. Danielson, the man we want was never your patient. It would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence. Please, Doctor - time is eating us up. Just show me the ones you've turned away.
Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D.
The Latin name comes from two rivers in Hell. Your man - he drops these girls into rivers, every time. Didn't I read that?
Your "father"?
'Cos frontier land's the only land affordable to poor people. So after seven years indentured service in Virginia, they headed out here where they are beholden to none and not livin' by another's leave...  Their name was Cameron. John & Alexandria.
Do not.  Promise me.
What?
Some say that's the way of it.
It can be dangerous...
I am sorry, Duncan...
You know he wouldn't send me...! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this.  I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said...
No.
: Only one or two loads.
I said... France is your enemy. Not ours.
That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly does not know to send reinforcements!
Thank you. How can I reward you?
Excuse me. What did you say?
Wampum?
How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?
And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
They may leave the fortress fully armed, but with no ammunition... Other than that, ask what you wish.
La victoire.
I'm not a doctor.
Danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
What has?
I am thinking, man!  You think I want to die!  I am thinking!  I--
That's an order!
Fuck your orders!
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
Roger...  More light, Sixpack...
The escape bubbles?
He's not at his station.
What's wrong with it?
Twenty minutes!...Who had tank duty?
Ahhhh!
Better let the Doc take a look at you, after dinner.
Do it.
It wouldn't make any difference in there...He could be two feet away and on fire and she'd still not see him!
Take it off and let me have a look.
Shhhh...don't tell no one.  Job security.
That <u>thing</u> happens to be my friend.
I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!..
Twelve hours!
Two hundred meters.
What are you going to do to him?
Jameson?  Who're you trying to con?
Well, why haven't they answered our flares?
Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
Answer them and quit kicking me!
Seven hundred for the pair.
Yeah, but he has got to tell his Dad he is about to lose his bar.
Let's have a butcher's. Jesus, there's lots of everything. We've got god knows how much of this stinking weed; we've got a shit load of cash; and we've got a . . . traffic warden.
Apart from those shotguns.
A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.
Where're the others?
There were two old guns there; where are they?
I see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond film, is it?
Can I help?
Good job, Chris.
All right, furry muff.
I am sure you do, but I don't think you understand; I am not going to see them or the guns again.
This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.
Just give me the keys.
Out the back.
Invitations?
Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
Er, bad breath, colourful language and a feather duster! . . . What do you think they will be armed with? Guns, you tit!
Carrying them. They could all be carrying them for what we know.
He means they're thieving dogs.
For half a million?
Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.
Harry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his ear-hole, or you from a hoodwink. This bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it.
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.
Seven hundred each.
Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.
Get your fingers out of my soup!
When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know.
How the fuck should I know?
OK, don't panic; let's think about this.
You went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back carrying two bags of fertilizer. Alarm bells are ringing, Willy.
Catholic school, nasty.
You really want to know, sir?
Chaos.
No, sir. They all been real straight with me.
He'll live.
Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
You got a cause of death?
Colt Peacemaker.
He swore by it.  What?
If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?
Best part of the job.
This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.
Otis went on like you were that guy who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit.
Go out through the back.
You know who I am?
He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know--
Well, he's living proof of that, son. Living proof.
So you're going into the Army?
Yeah. He lives here, right?
Lead mine.
I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore--
You get the feeling he doesn't want to be here?
You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy?
We been through this before--
This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction.
Masons been around a long while.
You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar.
That's where he fell.
You get much of that in here?
If I thought it would help I'd put up a sign telling them not to. Right under the one about the employees washing their hands.
That's right.
I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
Why would you want to do that?
Bandidos, Injuns--
Mercedes Gonzales Ruiz.
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
No es la verdad--[That isn't true--]
This girl has a child?
Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]
Don't worry about it. He owes me some favors.
Seems like we have another one every week.
Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing hooky--
Floating around out here, playin' hell with them bass--play a little cards, play a little golf, drink some beer--
Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
And Buddy was one of them.
Charley Wade.
I got an idea what happened.
You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
I was too busy.
That's me.
I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
Not if I can help it.
What about it?
What was your deal with him?
Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade.
Of course you can.
Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys.
You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
I thought he busted you a couple times.
Well, you were working there--
Amado.
He hates me.
Fernando did okay, and he dropped out--
Looks real bad if the teacher's late for class. It's really nice to talk with you, Sam.
How come it feels the same?
So what are we gonna do about this?
You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
Yeah.
They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
I appreciate you telling me.
You suckers haven't had a good day since the Alamo.
No, Sheriff, I'm just--
This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
And people better clear out of here! Now!
Me neither.
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
How much?
Nix?
Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.
What about death?
I don't know.
Please... Butterfield... I wasn't there.  Ask Pimm.
Yes.
I think we make our own futures.
Does that mean...?
It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.
Jennifer Desiderio, for one.  She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things.  And he could levitate. Juggle fire.
Nothing?
Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.
Quaid and Jennifer--
Harry...
I'm here, Harry.
Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
He got up and walked.
Another fucking magician. Jesus.
No.  Not yet...
We've never met.
I saw him in Vegas once.
It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
What for?  You need to stay busy?
I'm afraid she's not in.
When will she be in?
Shut up!
No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after.
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
What?
That.
People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know?
You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists.  Except most of us aren't gentlemen.
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
Didn't know you read minds.
Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things,
What is?
Who's not?
Binding you.
Why would I want to?
Because you've got nothing else to live for.
I know. I don't either.
Do you want to have some breakfast?
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
I don't remember.
I don't know. My fax said "have a good fright".
Oh, for her show?
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
Where'd you grow up?
Oh, she'll love it.
You think so?
Do you ever see him?
Yeah.
I don't want to be.
No, we'll find something around here.
A coke.
Oh?
Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.
It's just carpet.
I don't know.
Hello, Bob, it's me.
Tomorrow.
Thank you, Mr. Harris.
Sure.
Ok.
I gotta go to work.
Its bad for you.
Ok, definitely call them, I'll be back Friday. I love you.
Sure.
Promoting that action movie I did...
We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.
I spaced out.
I don't know.  In a way, I'm glad it all happened.
I found the pentacle.
Seemed...on edge.
Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.
I'm gonna go make a stink.  Sit tight. I'll make sure you get a change of clothes.
Quite a compliment coming from you, doctor.
It's the patient's request, doctor.
You have a sister in New Orleans.
But it's true.  I have no faith.  It's strange.  When that gun was pointed at my face tonight, I was surprised, but never frightened.  It was as if I knew nothing could possibly happen to me and...in that one moment I didn't care about anything.  Not eve my own life.
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.
Just open the door, please.
I'll bet.
I think you gave me the wrong one.
It was blank.  Nothing on it.  You gave me the wrong one.
At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man, Peter.
You should think about getting professional help.
You're already contaminated.  It's why you couldn't hear the tape.  There's probably a pentacle near your bed.  To sanctify you.
My parents are dead.  Don't even think of bringing them into this.
So what?
I'll go outside and take a look in the garage.
That can't be right.  My birthday's tomorrow.
I don't know.  Probably have a copy of my birth certificate...my apartment.
I was desperate.  I knew you wrote about murders.  I needed a way in.
What are these?
You have to be experienced to do this. Just wait outside. Otherwise, you risk killing him.
And what's that mean?
I know who he is.
I'll explain everything later.  Can you meet me tonight?
I've filed a report with Father Frank.
You know what they say.  You have the same chance of winning whether you play or not.
Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.
Really?  You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.
Yeah, murder-suicide.
Mother killed the father, then killed herself.  Crime of passion.
She told me she killed them.
Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
That's not it.
What's ridiculous is not being a caterer so your husband can feel like a man knowing his woman's home cooking and ironing his drawers.
You had your coaches and your father for that stuff.  It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.
The blue.
What'd you do?
We've got our final games against Oregon and Oregon State and I want to shake things up a bit, so I'm starting you at point again.
You want the job or not?
You might be the only one with a job.
Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
Mom tell you to do this?
No.
He's in college?
If you were tore up I would not be claiming you.  Trust.
Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
Just wanted to say good game.
It's better.  Even though the whole first season my teammates didn't pass to me cause they were mad "The American" was making more money.  I led the team in rebounds cause it was the only way I could touch the damn ball.
I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my cheerleader.
I never knew a girl that could play.
He works at a bank.
He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
Five seconds.
So?
I don't.
Who's Spalding?
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
Would you watch the damn road?
You either.
Hey.
Yeah.
I was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all.
What?
You had four offensive rebounds.
You do see me standing here, right?
Who cares if you're never known as the first girl in the NBA.  You'll get more play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway.
Coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew. If I'm late, I don't suit up.
You think for once we could talk about something besides basketball?
You forgot to be there.
Look, I'm entering the draft.
No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
No.
You're serious.
Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him.  Now, I kinda think I need to try something else.
Like what?
What?
From basketball.
Monica, after that stuff with my dad, I couldn't trust anybody, okay.  I mean, I was lost.  So you are forgiven.  But that was five years ago.  I moved on.
At one in the morning?
What's that, not great?
I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
I don't know, he had a meeting or something.
That's right.
I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle.
I need corrective oral surgery. I need the braces.
How are you paying tor the braces, Donnie?
I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.
Jimmy you look like you're about to fuckin' die right here --
Nothing's wrong, I just got some guy on the phone on my other line, he's says he works for this guy, this guy who's Frank's father --
Does this sound weird?
It's a helluva disease.
Sure is.  So why call me?
I'd like to talk to you.  Your boyfriend let me in, I just knocked on the door --
He's not my boyfriend.
No.  No.
I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.
...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia. Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you --
I have something, so much -- I'm sick, Claudia. I'm sick.
I'm coming!
I got a call of a disturbance, screaming and yelling, loud music.  Has there been some screaming and yelling?
About two years ago.
You and your boyfriend have a party last night?
-- do you wanna cup?
Arlight, then.  Cheers.
I'm sorry.
Just Jim.
You wanna go on a date with me?
Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do?
No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time?
It's my favorite place --
So you've done it --
Let's make a deal.
Can I tell you something?
Ohhhh I started this, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, fuck.
Jesus Christ, Stanley, you can't go to the bathroom now.  You have exactly one minute before we're back on the air, this is NOT the time to go to the bathroom.
I'm, I need to go, I'm gonna --
We gotta get his money so we can get outta here -- we gotta --
I'm trained, I'm ready to go, you wanna buy some candy to help underprivelaged youth in the --
No.
-- watch the mouth, homeboy, I don't need to hear that word --
Alright, alright, cut it, coolio. That's enough with the mouth and the language.
What's up?
Doc, just - don't, how close are you?
What?  What does that mean?
Might of been before my time.
I lent my name, my celebrity. Exactly --
Solomon, please.  Please.  I am so fucked here if you do this.  This is the worst timing. The worst timing I could ever imagine. I need to keep working.  I have so many debts, so many things, I have, I have, I have -- I have surgery -- I have my oral surgery coming --
Yes I do.
Where is he?
...ah...maybe...yeah...she's a good one...
Do me a personal favor --
Go fuck myself?
Frank Mackey.  That's your son?
...Lily...?
Yeah...So I go to her school for that for grade twelve...and we meet...she was fuckin...like a doll...porcelain doll...and the hips...child bearing hips...y'know that?  So beautiful. But I didn't have sex with anyone, you know?  I was not...I couldn't do anything...always scared, y'know... she was...she had some boyfriends...they liked her y'know...but I didn't like that. I couldn't get over that I wasn't a man, but she was a woman. Y'see?  Y'see I didn't make her feel ok about that....I would say, "How many men you been with?" She told me, I couldn't take it...take that I wasn't a man....because if I hadn't had sex with women...like as many women as she had men...then I was weak...a boy.... But I loved her...you understand? ....well, of course, I wanted to have sex with her...and I did and we were together....we met...age twelve, but then again...age seventeen...something, somethin... I didn't let her forget that I thought she was a bad...a slut.....a slut I would call her and hit her....I hit her for what she did...but we married...Lily and me and we married...but I cheated on her...over and over and over again...because I wanted to be a man and I couldn't let her be a woman...a smart, free person who was something...my mind then, so fuckin' stupid, so fuckin....jesus christ, what would I think...did I think....? ...for what I've done...She's my wife for thirty eight years...I went behind her... over and over...fucking asshole I am that I would go out and fuck and come home and get in her bed and say "I love you..."  This'z Jack's mother. His mother Lily...these two that I had and I lost .... and this is the regret that you make...the regret you make is the something that you take...blah...blah...blah... something, something.....  Gimme a cigarettee?
Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
This isn't meant --
Are you asking me that?
Do you remember a Miss Simms?
Go ahead and waste your time.
Hollywood, mainly.
From '84 to '89.
My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.
Yeah let's...maybe just stand.
Let's just wait one minute and stay here, okay?
I'm really sorry.
yeah.
Then you've got nothin' to worry about.
You're here.
No.
You want her right now?
I was saying...thinking maybe I'd get my own quiz show someday, Jimmy. Just like you!
-- did she talk to you?
Love you too..
I'm a bad person.
No.  No.
You feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins?  Honey, you're not on your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble --
I don't hate you, Jimmy.  But I have a couple questions that I wanna ask....
How long with Ellen?
It's over.  I talked to her this morning.
I love you so much.
I really don't know.
Yes you do....you do and you won't say.
Yes you do.
No.
No.
-- I have something to tell you. I have to tell you something. I want to change his will, can I change his will?...I need to ---
Adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- Linda. Linda. Calm down.
I've got Frank...Frank Earl's son. He's...he asked me to get him and I did --
I didn't know the answer --
Yes.
Go to bed.
...what...?
No, M'lady.
I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
Why would you ask now?  You never asked before!
Soon enough.  Here we are.
Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
There is that, of course -- but mainly it is because I am so much smarter than everyone else.
But -- what is Porthos doing?
Come now, Athos, if Porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity.
We have grown wiser with age.  Now we know that some problems cannot be settled with a sword.
Catacombs.  Very holy.
I remember that night.  D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way.  The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos?
The child of the king is... the king.  Louis!
We will make our own luck tonight... if Phillippe holds up.
She died giving you to me.  And I want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves.
Fromberge...?!  At the front?!  No.
Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul --
I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting.
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
She will be at the ball.
A personal nature?
There is more to love than he knew, or that you know.
Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --
That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place!
Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!
It shall be done, your Majesty.
... You knew you had a double?
No, Keeper.
No.  He cut an ear from one of the men, no one else was hurt.  Captain d'Artagnan allowed him to leave. Athos was upset about the death of his son, at the front.
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
That food has spoiled.  That is why it was not shipped to the army.
It's lovely.  It's just...
Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The straits of your family need not be permanent.  It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.
No, you may wait behind the screen.
Oh Louis, Louis...
Yeah?
That's the point.  He slipped up, and he's desperate now.  And that means he's all the more dangerous.
The shit just hit the fan, brother. That bitch has a partner and he got away from me.
So what is they have enough to shut us down!
We're by Ozone...
I didn't hit shit!
So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked vice.
Mm-hmm...that's not what the bartender told us.
Nothing!  He didn't do nothing!
Well read this -
Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?
Six months ago, a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note, you may have heard of it...
So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them.
Where the hell is my car?
I have nowhere else to go, Tubbs, I need your help!
1490...Breckinridge...
What else is new?
And look at the balances...these aren't police salaries...
Don't worry about me...  ...and don't forget your helmet. You don't want to get a ticket.
Screw him!
Not with this...
I wouldn't presume to try.
Why aren't you ever alone with him?
That's when it happened?
I don't recommend it.
And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out.  At the top it says: 'I hope we can correspond.' And then the hole begins.  It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away.
He doesn't have anything to cut with.
He'd know it from articles he's read about Lecktor...
At the end is the tail of what could be an 'r.
No. Galatians 15:2? Galatians has only six chapters. The same with Jonah 6:8 -- Jonah has four chapters. Lecktor wasn't using a Bible.
Where?
Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
I'll try to keep him as far away from it as I can...
Why not?
I'LL come back later. I got messages at the Holiday Inn to collect.
We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time.
See? You do know something about him.
...I'm going to see Lecktor.
We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.
Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says.
Wait, Will...
From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning.
How do I know?!
What?
Don't talk to me!!
There's some film cans in the far corner of the room underneath one of the windows.
Are your parking permits in the computer? He drives a van.
In eight days.
They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children...
I'm fine.
According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said.  You know now, don't you?
Yes.
Are you a man?
No.
Yes?
Okay.
Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not.
Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?
I call him a monster.
What about the dog?
Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
I'd like one of your cigarettes, please.
No.
And... where are things?
I have to go back to Birmingham.
Will? Are you okay?
I want to see you, too.
That's not true.
I know... 'Out in the good air...'
Go on to the house.
Are you George Sherman?
Yes. Who are you?
What is he? Afraid to leave you alone with me now?'  He read the Tattler piece, didn't he?
Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
I figured I'd ask you...
I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you?
With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait.
She got all right?
Very interesting, even to a layman.
You've read the transcript. It's all there.
Pray tell.
No. I knew that I'm not smarter than you are.
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
I'll study it, Will. When you get more files, I'd like to see them, too. You can call me. When I have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone. Would you like to give me your home number?
I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it.
Fight what?
You should, Will. God's terrific!  He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn.  Don't you think that felt good?  He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders.
No.  Caspiar.
I'm not a comedian.  I have no talent.  I'm a song-and-dance man.
The stewardess let me keep my headphones.
LISTEN, you arrogant putz!  I've been in this business for twenty years!  I know!  If you walk away from this opportunity, you will never, NEVER see another one like it again!!!!
What's up?
Tell you what.  I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --
He is the Southern Heavyweight Champion.  He'll kill you.  First, you piss-off women.  Then you piss-off the South.  Then you get killed!  And I did the bookings.
Do you wanna tour the clubs?
Yeah!  He's a psychic surgeon in the Philippines, and he's amazing!  He rubs you and sucks the disease right out!
Okay, great!  So let's reset!
I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day.
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
No thanks.
I can shtop whenever I want...
Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.
But I don't do drugs!  And I don't enjoy making light of them!  I was promised creative control!
I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
And you're just poor white trash!
You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
I dunno.  If they were, they'd be pushin' 80.
It is apparently not working.
I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!
Who is this? TONY CLIFTON  You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear.  Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.
I used to think you were original.
It's my name.
Oh shit.
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --
No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.
I know.  It's her fault.
We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.
Don't tell me you're a believer now?
No!
Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store.
Five minutes.  Maybe six.
Yes.  Now.
I can guide you out, but you have to do exactly what I say.
But what if...?
They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.
You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.
Your muscles have atrophied.  We're rebuilding them.
Yes.  A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines. I must say I find it almost funny to imagine the world slapping itself on the back, toasting the new age.  I say almost funny.
What -- what lesson?
She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is.
Yes.
She told you exactly what you needed to hear.  That's all.  Sooner or later, Neo, you're going to realize just like I did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path.
I need the main wet-wall.
We're on our way --
Yes, sir.
He is the One.  He is the One!
Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?
Honestly?  I don't know.
I just thought... you were a guy.
From you.
... shit.
We think you're bugged.  Try to relax.
It disables any electrical system in the blast radius.  It's the only weapon we have against the machines.
What?
I used to eat there... Really good noodles.
Are you worried?
A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
Yeah?
Where is it?
He's alive.
Can't we come with you?
'And with your spirit.'
'Thou art then a king?'
Jewish...
Hide the gun.  Throw it away. Anything.  Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean?
How about Teresa?  I could talk...
And say what?
I don't like loading crates.
We'll get some food from my aunt's. I'll get in through the fire escape. She's always got something.
Cut it out stupid.  It's me.
I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.
I'll be here.  Don't worry.
Good idea.
I don't understand, where's Groppi?
Nope...
Yeah, where's the rest?
Fine.
Fine.
Bye.
Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
What did he do?
Ok, we'll go for lunch.
Well, if things go the way I hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself.  God willing.
No...we can come back in a couple of weeks.  Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.
No.  Of course he lives there. Would I point it out to you if he didn't?
But...
Come on.
Yeah, it's your father's.
Can you spare it?
Unfortunately.  I sat between them at the Bronx Zoo benefit -- it was better than Seconal.
Have you got a minute?
Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
Yeah?  And what about my enemies?
Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?
Right away.
That's it.  It's over.  Get out.
'Here'?
Hot or cold.
"Death and Taxes"?
Of whom?
In my sleep.
What'd it say?
Did you just hear something?
Sounds good.
That's great!  Wait 'til I show it to Bontecou.
What do you mean?
Sorry.  I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.
I don't think so.  Do you?
Mandatory retirement upon our Chairman's sixty-fifth birthday.
Proof?  We've got plenty of proof.
I know.  Gum up the works.
How did Bill react to the leads you've developed?
No, no.  I on holiday.
None facety, mistah.  You come for me?  Dat's good news.
Schoolboy tings is you head. Badness for you, badness for her, badness for me, lyin' here tumor, big as breadfruit, poison my inners an' waiting.
Can do no right by people.  Come to take, you wan' to stay, leave you stay, you wan' to go.  Rahtid!
Jennifer.
Good morning, Jennifer.
It's so very nice to see you again.
No problem.  I'll leave you two alone.  I can tell you guys have something on the fire --
'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.
How did you meet?
What do you mean 'free'?
-- Can't seem to escape you today.
I am Joe.
I can see why.
I don't mind --
Be sorry for nothing.
Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon.
Please.  We don't need to talk about Drew.
Never tried, 'til now.  Joe, may I kiss you?
Yes, he's tired.  I believe so.
It gets worse.
But there's so much to tell you --
Yes, that's why I said it.
-- That was the place... and you were the guy.
Shook me up.  I mean that you knew her and everything --
Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?
How about giving a guy a break?
Not this.
What's it like where I'm going?
Can you keep a secret?
Yes.
Are you sad, Bill?
Oh.  Okay.
Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife --
I guess...
What way would you put it?
That's okay.
With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me.  So watch it...Bill.
-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.
Say again?
I love her, Bill.  She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand.
Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.
It's not necessary, Joe.  Drew's going to step aside --
Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
-- An IRS man.
You're coming to 'take me'.  What is that?  Who the hell are you?
And then --?
Try.  Because 'if you haven't tried, you haven't lived'.
What you were talking about.
Quiet.
Time.
I'm sorry --
'Yes' is the answer to your ques- tion.
Bill.  Come on.  The question.  The question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in Delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning.  The question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself --
Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?
Okay, Eddie -- anyway, thanks for the memory.
Does Drew tell you everything?
I am.  With you.
Well, I wasn't going to say that --
So what's wrong with that?
You're not listening --
Bravo.
Stay open.  Who knows?  Lightning could strike.
He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway.
What?!
Nothing.
Where's he going?
Yes, but --
Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.
My kid sister.  She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.
Why?
I think I know her.
Just loud enough to wake me up.
As requested.
What?
This isn't my room?
No, let's go.
When was I in here?
Leonard.
That's right I did, didn't I?
Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
Who is he? What have you got me into?
I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
Your wife?
Where is he?
And? 
Somebody's come. Already.
What's this all about?
What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
Can I ask you something?
Who's your boyfriend?
My name's Leonard.							 *
I'm not appealing the decision.
Then why are you here?
You said you were leaving town.
You don't have to remember to be hungry.
No! Should I?
Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
I don't know.
What's wrong with this one?
I'm trying to help you. I knew she'd get her claws into you. She doesn't know anything about your investigation, so when she offers to help you, it'll be for her own reasons. Why would I lie? Do not go back to her. Take out a pen, write yourself a note, do not trust her.
I won't be happy until you leave town.
What sort of questions?
I have money.
So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?
That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was.
I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town looking for information. The local boys put us in touch.
When it's done, I'll know! It'll be different!
I'm not. I was the cop assigned to your			* wife's death. I believed you, I thought			* you deserved the chance for revenge. I helped you find the other guy who was in your bathroom that night. The guy who cracked your skull and fucked your wife.		    * We found him and you killed him.				  *   MEMENTO - Green Revisions 10-4-99 115A.
My mother calls me Teddy. I'm John Edward Gammell. Cheer up, there's a lot of John		    * G's for us to find. All you do is moan.			* I'm the one that has to live with what			 * you've done. I'm the one that has to put		    * it all together. You just wander around			* playing detective. You're living a dream,		   * kid. A dead wife to pine for and a sense		    * of purpose to your life. A romantic quest		   * which you wouldn't end even if I wasn't			* in the picture.							    *
Quit it!							 * 					   * You're not a killer, Lenny. That's why			 * you're so good at it.						   *
You can't just take it!
What's your twenty?
Turn around.
And...?
He any good?
Recruit us to do what?
They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment...
Tell them what you want.
They knew about Alonzo, <u>before</u> he made a move on them.  They had our operation.  They've cut into us.
All I want to know is the where and the when.  Spare me mini moves, progress reports and bullshit.
And what is that?
Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
Angolan Military.  Went back to the fighting.  Disappeared.  Who knows...?
They're all the same.  "Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you."
Would you?  Because if you couldn't, I would be very lonely... I would have left the only world I know and have known since I was seventeen.  But none of this will happen.  So it doesn't matter.  Because we are on the Guajira Peninsula.  And all you see around you...look around... is Archangel de Jesus Montoya- Londono.  He is my man.  And you are a smuggler moving a load...
Sonny Burnett...this is my partner, Rico.
What'd Neptune tell you?
Here's what this is...ask how much they want to turn back to us our load...
Fifty-gallon drums.  Thirty-two.  A hundred kilos in each.  You transship that to the Malaysian boat.
'Cause she will tell you.
Alonzo...
Port-Au-Prince.
No.  You gonna give me phony reassurances?
And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
So we want to change-up the mission statement.
I am asking.  You to me.
Too fast.  Too many moving parts.
Okay.  What's up?
That's right.
We don't know.
How will it stand up?
If they ran the rental car or lease on this place...even if it's EPIC database in El Paso...they'd have to work through the layers of bullshit three weeks deep.  Then they'd find your deeper, hidden criminal selves...
They had me from the gate.
We think NLR.  We don't know! Alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet.  He wasn't deep into the crew.
He's talking to you, bro.  What he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization...
Switek pulling this off...?  That's not faith; that's delusional...
Good idea.  We'll grab a bite.
Jos doesn't like the deal in South Florida...
Define small.
Slow and low, Adam A-500s...  ...carbon composite, stealthy, 1400 nautical-mile range, thousand ki payload...all the way to Caravels and 727's from a source country to a transshipment point.  Small freighters.  We've done containers...
Do we need this...?
It is.  He try to take tonight's load?
Beg pardon, ma'am?
Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
You sure are a pretty lady.
Y -- what in hell starts with Y?
For what?
My friend O'Daniel. That's who you need. Operates the biggest stable in town. In the whole goddam metropolitan area. A stud like you - paying! -- not that I blame you -- a dame starts crying, I cut my heart for her...
It's sticky. What you do, slobber on 'em? I wouldn't touch 'em.
I'm impressed. You're a killer.
I been sick. Hold this, will ya?
What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna make a cowboy outta you, kid. How about that? Build you up a little, teach you couple little tricks'n turn y'out to stud, Rat-stuff.
Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his grave.
But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.
Rico. Rico Rizzo.
Who?
I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
You want me to leave?
Uh, yessir.
This Pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail bait -- but built? Ten bucks she wanted. Three of us made a deal for, twenty-five, see, big goddam bargain?
You got it.
Is he all right!
Yeah, what do you think this is, the good USA? This is Turkey, man... ) It's a fucking accident here if you're innocent. And anyway... ...ain't nobody who's innocent.
It's already built!  There's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff, but beneath that there's these old catacombs that the Christians built 'bout a thousand fucking years ago to bury their dead.  We're sitting right on top of it -- here.
The prison, man. There was this German cat an architect in the hospital. He was helping the Turks build some shit round the place. I laid some bread on him and he let me copy them.
...Don't worry about it.  I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here.  You all right?
For the money... )
Sure.
Yes...?
Yes.  I think so.
How much did you figure to make?
He wasn't even in the car?
Seven years...
And?
Yeah.
After we're outside the kogus?
What?
Mr. Yesil.
Right.
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
Oh, man, there you go again.
Go!! Just go!!
Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!
Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!
Right.
She used a baster.
Sure.
I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.
I can take it, go ahead.
It has no nobility.
I guess that means it's okay.
My pleasure.
I'm getting to believe you.
I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted?
Yeah, that and Misery's Child--those are the only two divine things ever in this world...
Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--
Then who did?
I'll get you everything you want, but you must listen first. Sometimes my thinking is a little muddy, I accept that. It's why I couldn't remember all those things they were asking me on the witness stand in Denver.
Yes.
Now don't josh. This is a very big day for you, Paul. Here. You just sit tight, and I'll set everything up.
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written.
What's the matter? I'll tell you what's the matter. I go out of my way for you. I do everything to try and make you happy. I feed you, I clean you, I dress you. And what thanks do I get? "You bought the wrong paper, Annie. I can't write on this paper, Annie." Well, I'll get your stupid paper, but you just better start showing me a little more appreciation around here, Mister Man.
Don't be silly. You'll be brilliant. Think of me as your inspiration.
You better. Oh, Paul, when Ian realized that the reason they'd buried Misery alive was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma--
Yes, to Misery. Let me pour you some more wine.
What?
I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
What? What is it?
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
Yeah, I understand he's been up here the last six weeks.
You think he might be missing?
No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary?
I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
If I can.
You're still a writer.
Marcia, why are you doing this to me? Don't you know I'm scared enough? Don't you think I remember how nobody gave a shit about my first books? You think I'm dying to go back to shouting in the wilderness?  I'm doing this because I have to.  Now, I'm leaving for Colorado to try to finish this and I want your good thoughts--because if I can make it work ...  I might just have something that I want on my tombstone.
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes.
- right -  - don't go too far ahead of me now -
From her point of view or mine?
Magic...
I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
To do what?
What are you talking about?
In downtown Sydney for a start.
I knew where it was.
Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together.
May I say something, no offence?  You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?
Where did you get this number?  I don't even have it!
Your help?  What are you talking about?
That they're lying.
I don't know that they 'pinched' it. Don't even know that they're blokes.
Damn, you're beautiful.
I'd like a little more conviction..
Something like that.
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
Look, would it make you feel better if I didn't want you to do this?
Probably that I needed him in some urgent way..destitute - in serious trouble..the kind I couldn't possible sort out myself..
Very funny..maybe he has heard and doesn't want to know.  Maybe he's lost interest.
Ethan, you take care of yourself, I'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove, I'm gonna bail - and without giving two week notice.
Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money --
Ethan, tell me -
No...
Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.
Well, then I mislead you.  Or you made the wrong assumption.  Either way we're asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn't already done.
Well it's not mission <i>difficult,</i> Hunt. It's mission <i>impossible.</i>  Difficult should be a walk in the park for you.  If you can think of a quicker way to get to Ambrose, you're welcome to try.  Oh, by the way, you might want to take a look at these..if you have any further qualms about getting her to do the job.
We think we've got our finger on the buyer.
No.  I can't afford to be curious.  And neither can you, Hunt..
Where is she now, by the way?  Do you know?
The satellite doesn't work as fast as I do.
Right.  I guess there aren't many flu epidemics in the middle of summer.
Left jacket pocket?
Nyah, Ambrose is heading back.  There's an enveloped inside --
Yeah.  Why else would he come back to Australia?  If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.
Nyah still on the property?
I'm not waiting 48 hours.  When we're done at Biocyte, if she's not out of Ambrose's, I'm going in and getting her out.
By asking me.
Dimitri Miediev...Dimitri Miediev...
Let's not waste time chasing him.  Make him come to us.  Everybodys got pressure points.  Find out something that's important to him personally and you squeeze.
Same thing he wanted in Prague!  Same thing he's always wanted!  The NOC list!
I dont know.  It didnt say on the tickets.
I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
What?
How about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and I wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole.
Certainly Ethan.
I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
Profitable.
You're all kidding yourselves. Even with top of the line crypto.  Cray access. STU 3's --
Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?
The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.
Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss being disreputable.
Why should I?
Mm - Hmmm...
<u>Ten</u> million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.
Bank?
We'll see.
Always.
What about my coat?  I'll freeze.
Why?
You misunderstood.  No one sees Max.
He won't be back in a hurry?
<u>Negative</u>, Golitsyns on the move.
If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me. Ill have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train.  Marcel Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in Paris.
Youre probably right.
Dont flatter yourself - six was for <u>Eastern Europe</u>.  You made a lousy deal - ten for the world?  What is that?  But I needed you for the transfer with Max.  I got a little extra change;  and you got a little extra too.
And a lonely ass.
Twenty minutes.
Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
I forgot to wave. We'll have it at the wedding.
Nobody. Loretta is getting married.
Why you drinking so much?
I don't know, Rose. I don't know where I've been, and I don't know where I'm going.  You should have your eyes opened for you, my friend.
Thank you, Rose.
You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
And that's how much I'm saying.
Bed.
More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?
Let's go tell your Mother.
What are you doing here?
You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp!
I brought you something.
You have too many dogs.
What's wrong can never be made right. 
Yes.
Yes. Do you want...
That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood.
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
I'm telling you your life!
Because I have no Luck!
Me neither.
All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny.
I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
You don't get along with anybody!
I thought I'd try it.  You look good.
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
I couldn't believe it! I didn't think she was going to die. I knew she was sick...
I'm here!
You're late!
We're here.
That's right.
I'm really afraid.
Why?
I was.
No, I'll tell him.  What am I going to tell him?
Alright. A month. In a month.
Sure.
We should talk alone.
I have no secrets from my family.
Where's the ring?
Pop don't like Johnny.
Not yet. That old lady makes him sweat.  Where's that card?
Where's pop?
Upstairs. Johnny Cammareri showed up last night.
Oh God, that's too bad.
What sins have you to confess?
I have heard that Johnny Cammareri got down on his knees in The Grand Ticino and proposed to her.
He owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none.
If I hit the stick too hard, the apple will split. If I am too timid, the apple will fall off the stick.
She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you.
That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
What happened?
None of your business.
Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
What you don't know about women is a lot.
Yes.
I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?
What? What?
What would he be doing down there?
You're using coconuts!
Well, it doesn't matter.   Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
The Bridge of Death? ... which leads to the Grail?
NI!
What?
I move for no man.
So be it!
You're a liar.
I'm invincible!
My liege ... forgive me ...
Who ... Who breaks out?
No.  No.  No!
That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden O Tim.
How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
Man!
Well ... I AM king.
Yes.
Shut up!
Shut up, will you. Shut up!
Come on, patsy.
Course it's a good idea.
Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes.  He won't be long.
That's all right.  See you on Thursday.
Camelot?  Are you from Camelot?
Listen, Alice ...
Until you, or anyone else ...
Make sure he doesn't leave.
Why?
Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
Back to your bed!  At once!
Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
Not down south you don't.
Not bad, not bad.
If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
She'll think it's her fault for keeping me.
You've got three broken ribs, man!
Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
You wouldn't happen to know what the Queen's reading for recreation, would you, Mary?
Yeah.
Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --
Well, I'm sorry, but I really do think it's too much that the gentlemen of the house should be dictated to by a servant.
That's a tautology lad.  If you say the Queen arranges something, you've no need to say she's done it personally.  That's understood.
Her Highness' Equerry.
Aye, do.
I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.
In matters concerning the Household, I act on her behalf.
Yes.  I do.
That can wait till the weekend.
Don't think I can't persuade her.
The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public.  John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense.
I am.
I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
And I intend to be there when she's ready.
Are they worth reading?
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
I do not do it for others.  But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you.
I heard something.
I ordered it.  It's for your own safety.
I was told you were in a fight.
Have I ever let you down before--?
Because I have to! 
The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
Well, both.
I hope he got his mother's permission.
Just them?
I understand he was in a fight.
Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
How'd you know it was us?
It's the game, ARCADE.
Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
Everybody's sick, huh?  It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that.
So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
No.  Look, I know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway...  I think the game's alive somehow.
It's the middle of the night.  They're asleep.  Phone didn't wake them.
All of them?
Sure.
What?!
Like the fractals?
The Police, then...
Dante's Inferno.
Got it.
Yeah, that's what worries me.
Good.   Cause I'd freak if you weren't.
Fucked up.  That's what they said I was.
I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.
Who fired everyone?
Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls.
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.
So why did you idiots bring me here? ... I'm in the middle of making a picture.
Whatever.
That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
I understand.
I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
Yes, he is. He raises corn.
Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
Wow!
His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.
She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.
She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that.  I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel.
All right, but...I'm going to check on you.
I'm...I'm... oh no... I thought when I woke up... I thought sleep would do it ...
How do you remember how to talk?
Unh, unh.
When you think about them... the money... the key ... does it make you remember anything?
Mulholland Drive?
Not that I can see.
"Before what?"
I'm all right.
Let's see if we have a pass for Betty Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good luck Miss. Elms.
You see what I mean...
Right then.
Could be unrelated.
Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.
Oh yeah.
Interesting.
No...
I made this place..... now listen to me. I'll get out of this room, we have bigger troubles than this....
Leave him, he's dead.
You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
You've been doing a bang up job so far. Right now Matt is probably dead and it's your fault.
Excuse me ?
Is this really the time ?
Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.
It's poison gas, this is the antidote. Drink it.
Well, I'll see you at the next staff party.
Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
I'd get out of the water if I were you.
Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
Excuse me, sir ?
While I am not morally against these little, shall we say "hobbies", as long as I am on the payroll, but why not something like a yacht club ?
I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
Do you think the assistant, what's his name...
I'm just looking for our best interests. May I have the tapes, Bruce ?
No I am not.
Bruce has just awaken.
Of course, this one's a gimme. Just be patient, even Ol' Bruce can't outwit some of these traps.
Ach ! How will you know if they've made it ?
What happened ?
The power went out in half the park.
As appealing as that sounds...
Thank you.
Fine, fine, I feel like a chicken McNugget.
Maybe all that testosterone plugs his ears.
We just having our first date when you showed up.
Where are we ?
Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.
Look, Miss. I know you're still upset about that incident in Chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business. We don't have time to play nursemaid to every single Tom Dick and Harry.
Maybe we should make the time. Especially considering the sixteen million dollars we have set aside expressly to settle law suits from these very events.
No, I'm writing to the phone company because they keep charging me for calls to Caracas, Venezuela...do you know any know anybody in Caracas, Venezuela?
UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.
What about living in the real world pal?
Look, sergeant I know I said some things last time that I shouldn't have said at all but...
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could... talk.
Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.
Seriously?
What boy likes you?
It's just a question, it's not about anybody.
Thanks, I needed that.
Yes I know, it runs in the family.  New book?
I'm sorry, it's just...I've been taking all these seminars to get in touch with my feelings and...sometimes it gets out of hand.
What're you saying?
You are?
Yeah, come on, let's talk.
Special effects?
Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when she was talking about lightning...audiences love stuff like that. And your mom knew how to work an audience.
We performed on the beach one summer...ha...everything went wrong.
I guess what I mean is, my mother married my dad after you...and then I was born, so I thought that...maybe you got divorced because of me.
She didn't wanna miss out on anything...especially motherhood...it got to be a real problem with us.
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
What can I do for you?
O.K. Thank you very much.
I'm sure she did. 
I want juice!
Well look, I know that all you care about is your precious mini-bike. It's obvious you have no sense of historical perspective, I think we're here.
It's not funny! I mean what am I gonna do? Without that yearbook I'm lost. I can't just walk around town looking for someone with a Wilson High School Letter sweater!!!
Just remember the needle in the haystack.
Change my name.
What if you don't wanna be found?
May I use the phone please.
This isn't just a mood ring.
ehh...Okay...but be careful, it has a lot of sentimental value.
Just come and get it...right here!
In the tar??
He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
Okay.
Sounds great, well you give 'em both one of these for me.
Come on...I'll show you where you're gonna stay.
Oh I see, 'cause usually that doesn't require such a lengthy consultation.
I'm saying he asked me out for coffee, like a real date, when was the last time you did that?
Wha...what do you mean? We have a date every night.
Well I'm sort of involved.
Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike.
I know, I guess it's just sort of preparing you for the rest of your life. It's not easy being a woman.
You're telling me.
Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.
Yeah, it would be kinda great.
It would be fantastic.
You leave your father to me.
O.K.
I would have tried to show her a good time. I promised her when she left that I would never forget her and I never did. Stanley Rosenfeld does not forget.
I like to buy off all the railroads.
You're such a baby.
Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy.
WHAT?
Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
What?
I'm impressed.
God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.
The bee stings! I can't breathe!
Yes they are.
I need the job.
Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...
Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....
I wrote that.
Oh, how do you mean?
I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.
Okay, sure.
No, why?
Did she ever see Vada?
This is where we are.
Is there enough room?
Yes.
I don't know which ball's mine.
O.K. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of the fridge.
It's for school, for summer writing class.
I love this guy! 
Sorry.
Soon honey, soon.
I know, I know, let's go on the &quot;sit on the bench and rest&quot; ride.
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked.
I'm very nervous.
Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.
Why do you think she says that?
Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but he made me laugh.
No.
Come here, sit down.
Are you here to take Shelly back?
Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.
Hi Mr. Bixler!
Big deal, I can do that too.  Thomas J, you got something!
I don't like touching fish, how do you pull the hook out without touching it?
Uh huh.
Who's that with your Dad?
Do you remember her?
Sorry.
Go???
Stand back.
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
Hi Vada, can you come out?
No.
Well, then, I'll take it up with her.
Part of being a New Yorker.
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w...
... I don't send you men, anymore. You don't know what to do with them.
It's called the Law of Love, asshole.
I can see why.
I noticed.  I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons.
Because I realized.  When I see him say "I do," that knife will be in my heart.  And it will be there every...
The man you love.
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
I'm moving this book to Viking.
Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing.
Which was the disqualifying factor?
The twin part.  I like to remain impartial in my contempt.
What? Because I'm a little understand...
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
After two weeks of cataloguing all his faults, I made a command decision that changed my life.
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
I've missed a step.
He has you on a pedestal.  And me in his arms.
Bad games, bad towns, bad pay, bad flights, bad hotels, real bad food. Homeless, rootless, lonely, maybe your copy gets into one issue out of four...
... unless he has a hump.
Then it could all come out, sooner or later.  Nobody should be in on this.  Just you and me.  Or, more correctly, I.
First girl I ever knew.  Who lets me give her a bath.
Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?
Boy, those were the days.
Like I said, dazzling.
Except for that.
That's my point!!
It's over.
I came here, looking for her.
This is where I proposed.
... and you knew about this.
Grand Old Opera --
Then why are you listening to her -
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
You get her those Vitamin E right away.
I got them right here.
Oh, sure.
Everybody likes to be as good as their word.
That's pretty close. He's going to be on the bill. Why not put Barbara Jean on with him?
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
Barbara Jean.
Yes. She's pretty rested up.
Okay, then we'll see you there.
Okay.
Stop it!
To the bathroom.
It's the den mother.
Not yet.
Can I help you?
She's been in the hospital two weeks yesterday.
All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.
Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.
I said, maybe I'll change my name again.
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
That Tom sure is cute.
Replacement party.
A guy named Walker. Amazing person. He's developed a huge following.
I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and...
We don't mess with accessories.
What kind?
Sixty-three.
I feel really good.
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
I don't know his first name.
No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog.
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
Yes.
I can't.
Oh.
Not me. Ain't never loved anybody. Ain't never been married. Won't either.
Linnea?
Eight-thirty in the chapel.
Don't you worry about Sueleen Gay.
Glad to meet you.
Might be good for you.
You're not.
I mean...
Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?
Just a minute.
Hello.
Well, I really think he's got a chance.
Peter Finch -- he's English.
I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
Well, you just remember, if you can't kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you're kicking... Ten minutes, okay?
Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.
You think it will?
Sure thing.
May I see your costume?
What...
When ya had it, did ya like it?
I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long.
Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time... Very good. You do keep up with the headlines.
I see.
Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.
What?
Okay, Wayne, step forward.
Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
What I'd like to do---
How 'bout Manson?
Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.
Songs. 'He's A Rebel', 'Leader Of The Pack', 'Town Without Pity', that Dusty Springfield song 'I Only Want To Be With You'. That's what I hear anyway. Her behaviour was the main thing the doctors' report used against you. So even if she would see me, which she won't, I couldn't put her on camera anyway. If I ask her, 'Mallory, are you insane?' And she starts singing 'Dead Skunk In The Middle Of The Road', that blows our whole case.
Don't worry about it.
What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun for starters.
Then was it worth it?
Was what worth it?
Describe Mallory.
Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory.  What's up here?  What's in here?
Sure.
No.
We are.  Your camera.
I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here.
It's like this, Wayne. Two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. These two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there. Now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move.
Unfortunately, yes.
Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'
Survival of the fittest.
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
I hear ya. Play.
Roger, no.
Rockin'!
Wayne Gayle!
Okay.
Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry. What's your title again?
Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you.
Scott, genius cameraman, Roger, magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I could sooner do without my arm than Unruly Julie.
I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.
Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more.
Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career.
And me.
Thanks, Duff. You' a nice guy. Not like Frankie.
No thanks.
I still don't know what you're talkin' about.
Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?
All right, then. All I want you to do is tell these boys here you didn't mean what you said about stickin' together an' all.
Anderson.
Name's Duff.
Looks like you're doin' a good job.
Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
Okay, I will.
Went to college, huh?
Oh yeah? That's my home town.
Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.
That's why you come back, huh?
You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
I wouldn't have let you.
Oh yeah, and then what?
Yeah, it's just a coincidence.
I thought you wasn't comin'.
Yeah?
Am I as good as they?
Hmmm - good coffee.
I don't want to hurt you.
How come you keep askin'?
We can always do that, Duff.
Well, that'll be the first time.
What's so hot 'round town?
Like a home, for one thing.
You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!
Yeah. That's right, Jocko.  Those white guys sure shoot up at you like a yeast cake if you just cock an eye at them.
Nothin'. I just figure you were the right man for the job.
Who're you?
Workin' a saw mill.  Here's to.
What's the matter? Don't smell so good, huh? Must'a broken some records.
Didn't I tell you to beat it - huh?
He's been hitting it pretty hard. Got high blood pressure, too. I guess it's hard on him, having you around.
Don't be too hard on him.
All right, son.
Thank you.
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
I doubt it.
I see.  Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.
And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter.
Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
Is that right?  Think you're gonna make it with her?
Anything you say, baby.
Omar, listen to me--
Enough talking!  We been talking for eleven fucking hours, man.  My throat's fucking raw!
No. I only needed the code from you.
What about her?
The Elders, mon...
What does this have to do with me?
I know.  You ever work with ghosts, Case?
I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
Stick with her. I want the process to become second nature to you. We fly for Freeside at dawn.
He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?
Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
The antitoxin. I'm not waiting until this is over. Give it to me now or there's no run.
Are you even really alive?
What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.
Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
It's Case. Remember me?
Fine, Dixie. Fine.
I an' I, man. I an' I.
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
What are you talkin' about?
How's the ice?
One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.
I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.
Why would you want me to kill you?
No, It's you that is full of shit. And blood. And bones. A typically imperfect organic being. You've been hopelessly predictable all along, but you're going to have to do better than that now.
I'll give it my best shot, mother fucker.
Why should I want to meet him.
... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition.
What the fuck... are you serious?
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
Petty good.
Yeah, I know.
You're Pam?
I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.
OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
Who told!
And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?
That is lingerie.
I am not letting you out of the house in that, young lady.
Anita!

Her dad sold a car to Leonardo Di Caprio's uncle and before he picked it up, her dad let us all sit in it and take pictures.
Uh uh. I'm Disco Barbie.
Transitioned?
You've done five of my ideas.
A flack jacket.
Uhh, no.
My sword.
You said that already.
For your information, I am very happy. Deliriously happy. I lead a very happy life!
Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.
That's the spirit!
I know.
So what are you thinking for college?
Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college.  We just go right into sheep herding.
Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
Of course. I remember everything from your class.
I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
Do you think you'll find her?
Wait, I was going to tell you--
But now you don't have to--
The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
The poem! I knew he liked the poem!  Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
It's really hard to do. Some kids try for all of-high school and never make it.
You so do not deserve to be prom queen.
<i>                      Now in the box, we'll wait and hide Until his curiosity Entices him to look inside...</i>
Barrel.
And heavy...
Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
That's twice this month you've slipped Deadly Night Shade into my tea and run off.  People might get the wrong idea and think you're unhappy at home.
Good.  I'm hungry.
There's nothing more suspicious than Worm's Wart -- it distracts one from every other taste and smell.
Can't you make other creations?
<i>                      -- A bow? --        But why? --                  How ugly! -- What's in it? --                What's in it?</i>
<i>                      -- It's a bat. --              Will it bend? -- It's a rat. --              Will it break? -- Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake.</i>
Oh, come on Dad...
What are you talking about?
Could be all night.  Guy gets his rocks off like this. Hangs out in queer S & M joints downtown.  Likes prettyboys like you.
You got a problem with me, Grady?
Listen to me, Grady, this is serious. Something really weird is happening.  It started out like just bad dreams but it's getting real bad.
I believe you.  You had some scary dreams, okay?
You mean a shithead.
Yeah.
Wow...
Fred Krueger.  The guy in her dream who's coming to kill her.  Seems he was a real guy, ten years before who went around kidnapping kids and killing them.
You don't have to.  You just have to believe in energy.
Well, what am I supposed to do?
Uh-uh.  Wait...
I don't know - a sharp pain.
you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here.  You had another nightmare, didn't you?
yeah, I had a bad night.
'Morning, honey.
Sure...go ahead.
All of them.
We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night.
I'll get it.  Please, I don't mind.
It's okay, I'm not tired.  Really.
I've been good.  When do I get cigarette priveleges back?
If Simms catches you in here after lights out, she'll chew my ass ragged.
Just tonight, please?  I can't handle the nightmare.  Not tonight.  Not after Phillip.
No, she's right.
I -- I think so!
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
He's real.
So?
The dispensary.  I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club meth.
Shit, that's what keeps people alive.
Yeah, but here you are.  How'd I get so lucky?  I thought you were trying to forget I was alive.
That's not true.  You're the one who's trying to forget.
You'll get to meet them all tomorrow. They're...survivors.  In a way.  All severely sleep disordered.  Insomnia, narcolepsy, bedwetting...
My mother's dead.  Died in her sleep.
My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
We're gonna try.
Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?
Anything?
I'll be okay.  Just give me a minute.
We can't get to her.  I've tried.
The by-product of guilt.  Psychological scars steaming from moral conflicts and overt sexuality.
There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
My God.
C'mon.
I'm a vegetarian.
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
I'm an actress.
Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?
Yes, we couldn't stop him.  If you can find an unsigned copy, it's worth an absolute fortune.
Really, no.
No.
Do you always say 'no' to everything?
You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.
Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
Hello.
You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
Okay.
You know, I'm not sure.  I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it.
I was.
There's no 'unless.'  No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
A bath would be great.
I have thought about you.
I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
What do you think?
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
You and every person in this country.
Oh.
Damn, I forgot the jam.
You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'
I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
Well, don't over-do it.  I don't want people saying, 'There goes that famous actor with the big, fat girlfriend."
Yes.
Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
He wouldn't say.
In a depressingly asexual way.
Yes, I think that one may be.
Is Miss Scott staying here?
Me?
Blimey.  What's that?
Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
Ahm... Bernie.
The others?
Yes?
No -- did you?
Buggered?
Really?
She's perfect, perfect.
That's not fair.
No, don't think I do.
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
Right.  No one else?
Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.
Yes.
Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.
Let me help.  We don't want all this shit cluttering up our lives.
Yes.
What book?
He also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere, but he didn't say how. He has been heard to say to his wife, 'I hate you, I don't ever want to see you again. You've betrayed me.'  So. Does anyone care to touch upon this further?
Yes, that is correct.
No. Mister Harding, that is not true.
Y-y-y-yes...
Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us.
All in good time, Mister McMurphy. All in good time.
On this ward?
Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group therapy.
Yeah, yeah, the hell with that crap! The World Series is goin' on right' now an' that's therapy also!
Ma'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy dog. Why, I haven't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks! Hi ya, Doc!
What did I see 'cept a grown man gettin' whipped so bad he can't laugh anymore.
Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay!
Shhh...
Wh-wh-where ya going, M-M-Mac?
I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R Ratched g-g-g-g...
Well, shoot, man! Whadaya say we take ourselves a little spin around the place.
Go ahead! Go back!
Just fine, Billy boy, just fine. Full of piss an' vinegar! They checked my plugs and cleaned my points...
Good boy, thank you, Billy.
Thank you.
Shit! This is too much!  Chief, I tell you we're gonna bust outta this place an' make it all the way to Canada before they know what bit 'em.
Whaddaya talkin' about? There's at least twenty guys in there. Let's wake 'em up and get this party on the road.
What for?
They went that way.
Come here a minute, Cheswick. You, too, Sefelt. Hey, all you guys, come over here, I wanna show you somethin'.
I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you!
Did to you and all the rest of you guys.
Now, what would I be trying to say?
You're fuckin' A-right, I am!
You heard me the first time!
Yeah... Okay, stand aside, you guys! You're usin' up my oxygen!
So why are you talking to him?
I'm busting outta this place.
Plan?... Oh, yeah, the plan... Yeah...
What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
I was open! Come on, let's play ball!
Who told you that?
Hit me.
Yeah, it's cold!
Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.
Poker!
Doc, what can I tell ya?
You bet, Doc!
It is worth considering... Miss Ratched?
Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
I'm not upset. All I wanna know, for the lovva Jesus...
Are you a doctor?
I'm the next one.
Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy!
Okay. Who else?
Shhhh. See ya around the ball park.
He's in charge.
What?
P.A. What the hell is that?
This way, Mister McMurphy.
No way...
Yes, Miss Ratched!
At this hour?
I don't know anything about that, Miss. I would have to examine you first...
Si.
You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
So.  How do we get to Rome?
Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
Sure-- But, before you do that, since we're putting all our cards on the table, I have a confession to make, too.
Exactly.
Ha un numero di telefono?
But, Faith--
No, you gave a very convincing performance.  And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
Does he love you?
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
Tell me.
I'd really rather not say.
Please.  I need to know.
Mickey Spillane?
NO.
Nice dress.
I don't know if that's such a--
The Sun Also Rises.  For Whom the Bell Tolls.  The Old Man and the--
The Boston Pops.  Season tickets.
Yeah.
No.  I just came by to apologize.
Are you asking me out?
I sabotaged it?  You're the one who lost him, remember?
No, it isn't.  I called off my wedding all because of you.
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
Uh huh.
Yes?
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
It's a pleasure to meet you, Faith.
And more...
Mommy, this is Faith.
You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.
No.  He smokes.
But somebody wrote those songs.
Is he married?
No.
Is he gay?
Yeah.  I guess you're right.  I really like the wallpaper we picked out for the den.
Larry brought me flowers last night.
No...  I can just tell.
It's still the new year...
That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
I don't think he understood what you were saying.  What's the airport number?
A phone message.  Only--
Sorry.
You think he misses me at all?
And you know what I thought then, Kate?  I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much.  I still hope that.
You're right.  At least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself.  Smile.
Okay, okay.  You join him.  But first will you ask if he's here?
Okay, here's what I think.  We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--
Like a detective.
And he is living proof.
Yup.
When you could've found one in America.
Oh.
He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
Giovanni.
No, why?
He missed me.
Faith.  Larry has something he wants to tell you about Damon Bradley.
She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
No!  That's not fair.  That's not it at all.  Look, something somewhere got screwed up.  Maybe some metaphysical wires got crossed.  I may not have the right name, but I was there.  I'm the guy.  I'm-- skywriting??
The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.
So look, kid, you don't think we c'n afford to be boxed out of a deal like this a deal I sweated and bled for on account of one lousy little cheese-eater, that Doyle bum, who thought he c'd go squealin' to the Crime Commission? Do you?
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
Confused kid? First he crosses me in public and gets away with it and then the next joker, and pretty soon I'm just another fellow down here.
But my own kid bro
Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.
But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
Let me explain you something, kid. Stooling is when you rat on your friends, on the guys you're with.  When Johnny needs a favor, don't try to figure it out, just do it. Now go ahead, join the congregation.
Mmhmmm.
A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
Boss loader!
Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals you know what they're worth to us?
Well, then, you know Cousin Johnny isn't going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubber-lipped
Don't say that!
...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me who?  -- who?
Give it to me my Pop's job
Things 're lookin' up on the docks, huh, Jackie?
Which side are you with?
The moment I saw you.
I remember you were in trouble all the time.
When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home I'd get into bad company.
I go for this stuff. You know this city's full of hawks? There must be twenty thousand of 'em. They perch on top of the big hotels and swoop down on the pigeons in the park.
I don't know.
It's quite  nice.
Hit me again, Mac.
Describing you. A square from out there. I mean you're nowhere.  Miss Four Corners.
I'm not lookin' to get crucified. I'm lookin' to stay in one piece.
And when things get in your way or people you just knock them aside get rid of Them is that your idea?
His racket?
You've been off in daisyland, honey. Everybody's got a racket.
I don't want it. But why don't you stay and finish your drink.
I know... I know... .
You... .
You think I stink, don't you? You think I stink for what I told you?
Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.
Edie, for years we pushed quarters into a cookie jar, to keep you up there with the Sisters, and to keep you from things like I just seen out the window. My own daughter arm-in-arm with Terry Malloy. You know who Terry Malloy is?
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
And learn about charity and justice and all the other things people would rather talk about than practice? Pop goes up to her and holds out his two arms, his right one closer to Edie; he trembles with emotion.
See this arm? It's two inches longer 'n the other one. That's years of workin' and sweatin', liftin' and swingin' a hook. And every time I heisted a box or a coffee bag I says to myselfthis is for Edie, so she can be a teacher or somethin' decent. I promised your mother. You better not let her down.
Let me by.
Tell it to me in there and my lips are sealed. But if I dig it out myself I can use it where it'll do the most good.
Give me that gun.
Yeah, considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball!
Are you on the level, Father?
Baseball bats that's just for openers. They'll put the muscle on you, turned-around collar or no turned-around collar.
I thought I recognized you. Saw you fight in St. Nick's a couple of years ago.
Really?
Sure... .
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.
My ain't we touchy this morning?
He's got his nerve, gum-shoeing around here after what you told him.
Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug somebody put on somebody... .  You think I should turn him in?
I'll bring him up to your loft.
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
OK skip it, Einstein. How come you never got no education like the rest of us?
Well, no, Johnny, I just thought I should've been told if
From where you stand, maybe. But I'm standing over here now. I was rattin' on myself all them years and didn't know it, helpin' punks like you against people like Pop and Nolan an'... .
One little dime you don't need.  I know you you're Edie Doyle. Your Brother's a saint  only one ever tried to get me my compensation.
I can't believe it a small fortune.   You can't buy me you're still a bum!  'Bye, Edie. Lord have mercy on Joey. 
Patrick, me lad, I'm ahead of you.
Definitely! Nolan, my boy, you're a walkin' distillery.
I wonder how many Hail Marys the Father'll make me say at confession.  It'll be worth it! The pallet is loaded now. Terry turns and approaches Nolan.
If I could get my hands on you...
You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
There's an old cemetery on this road. I've been there before.
You've got a right to be. We're trapped by a bunch of fiends.
Nothing is worth your life.
I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
You love me then?
The moon is almost gone!
There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
You mean...!
Is there time?
You know better than that.
I repulse you?  Very well.  It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!  I should say <b>die</b> with it!
Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn. AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...
Yes, it is.
Uh-- sorry.  Wrong number.
From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I left with Glenn.
Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
Did you know that when you married him?
Till they got busted.
Yes.
His assistant.
There's some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink.
Just that she got away.
So call her up.  Tell her don't talk to any Cubans.
Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from Lompoc?
Forty-five minutes.
You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again.
Yeah?  You think he'll let us in, we got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole with us?
I saw Karen Sisco.
Yeah, I did.
Whatta you wanna do?
All you gotta do is get in.
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
Coming to the Okeechobee exit...
That's all I wanted to know.
Oh.  Then this must be Adele...
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
What do you want to bet?
Excuse me, Adele?
Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.
Just like it.  Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?
Hey.  You learn from doing.
I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.
You must see yourself as some kind of Clyde Barrow.
Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...
Bleeding on a country road.
You'd probably tell me.
Really.
Uh-huh.  Well, but if --
Shit...
I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
Because you're having too much fun.
I like your hair.  And that suit.
Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
Yeah, but in a nice way.
Really?  I was thinking the same thing. If we could call time and get together for a while.
I don't know about that.  You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.
You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!
Oh, nuthin'.
You don't take 'em off, I'm gonna throw 'em off the overpass while they're still on your head.
I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.
In the trunk?
These guys, man, they're crazy.  Shit.
Looks like tonight.
First of all, if he kills you, he's not gonna get any more money out of you.
The next time I walk into a bank.
What's to think about?
How are you, Richard?
A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were.
The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622.
The flight?
Meaning?
And so now you're off to Glades.
You're not?
I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
Why would I do that?
We went out there, full SWAT, two choppers, the whole bit, but Linares started shooting anyway.  We put him down, but somehow Chirino got away.
You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
You find him, tell him the dog got run over and I'm out of grocery money.
He said he stayed here last November.
Technically.  They're separated.
Oh, he's moved out?
Can we change the subject?
What're you doing at Glades?
Dad...
Off a tip?
Hello?
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
The combination is three-ten-forty-four.
Hide them?  On a date with pilots?  I'm talking about how you make them show!
You liked that?
I don't buy that hot dog shit.  So you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to Haleiwa.
They'll all fly, but -- oh, shit...
Good shooting, Rafe!
I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots.
Yeah.
How sweet.  Is that when you put the move on her?
What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
We'll be loaded with 2,000 pounds of bombs and 1,500 pounds of fuel.  I got another Chinese phrase for Doolittle. "Mug wump rickshaw mushu pork."  It means "Who the fuck thought up this shit?"
Home of the Brave.
The brass is afraid of sabotage.  This makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service.
What about easier to hit in an air raid?
I swore not to talk about him tonight, but there's all this stuff I think I ought to tell you, that he didn't get a chance to.  Rafe was...he was lonely.  He had such high expectations of himself that he always felt empty.  The week he met you he told me he felt his heart had always lived in winter, and for the first time in his life he has seen the spring.
No baseball diamonds, Red.
Don't get smart with me, son.
We can explain, Colonel.
I know.
Our doctor's gone too.
Wait, let me look at that... You better come in here.
Boxin'.
Maybe not.  But I need you to know.  I love you.  And I will come back.  I'll find a way.  And then we'll get a chance to know if what I felt the first moment I saw you, and every minute since then, is real.
I'm so sorry for what you must've gone through, but I'm back.
There's nothing you can do here, they'll die or they won't, we just --
Brilliant, Admiral.
So those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel.
Fook ya!
The time has come to strike!  Or to sit and let the Americans cut off our oil and our future.  I know what you whisper to the others, Yamamoto -- that the Americans are strong.  Yet look at their leader.
It looks great. Don't change the subject. You know how busy Saturdays are. And I can't do the icing. I always mess up the roses. You're not being very responsible.
Peggy Sue!
You're probably the only one who could carry it off.
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
Jesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not used to that stuff. You always did the bills. Blame the damn post office.
I know. Put Scott through college.
I'm not going.
No. You are the undead. You will live forever if you give me your Twinkie.  Come on, let's have it. You hate them anyway.
Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today.
I can understand that.. But please don't start crying again.
You really love me, don't you?
But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait.
Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
Why?
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.
I will be happy if I have you. I love you.
I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
Just take a look at it. 
If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?
I thought you were...for a while.
What about Janet?
You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
He's very interesting. For all his pretending to be a tough guy, he's really got the soul of a poet.
A writer's life is his work. Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. He's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life!
Coffee and a donut.
Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
I hate chickens.
Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
Yes.
Wrong, Dad. Your idea.
Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool!
Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
Mom!
I had a dream that Grandma died.
She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?
What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
I don't know.
There's one way to find out.
I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
Not for you. Okay, there's lots more.
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
Wait! I'll go with you!
It's been a few years.
It sucked.
Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He got hurt again. I'm going over to take a look at him.
All set.
Why not?
What did?
You have to bury your own. That's the way the Indians did it. It's like a rule...
He was dead. You know he was.
Right here, Mom...
Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight...  I mean... he misses you, Mom...
You know everything, don't you?
In a word, Bob...
Charles is right behind me.
What's wrong with your face?
Yes, Bob, I do.  Excuse me? Am I being fired?
A reaction to AZT...
You're not going to like this. Please try to smile...
I said, "Everyone's going to die, Jimmy. But Drew's not going to die of AIDS. There's a cure around the corner, and he plans to be around to take advantage of it."
We're not skipping this treatment.
Fuck you.
No.
Maybe you should think about it.
Of course.
He's upset, he's sorry.
Uh, yeah.
Continue.
Correct. I don't.
One of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead.
We're friends of Beckett's.
Sure. It's fine.
Beckett?
I know a good probate lawyer.
You didn't look then, the way you look now?
I'm late, I have to pick up Amy from her afterschool but I want to talk to you about that Hansen thing.
Do you take risks?
Yes.
Do men have sex with each other in that theater?
That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.
You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?
And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.
Answer the question, please.
All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.
Yes.
Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease? So you tell me, today, there's no danger, and I go home, and I hold my baby, and six months from now I hear on the news: "whoops! We were wrong.' You <u>can</u> carry it on your clothes, your skin, and now I've got to worry about my kid. What are you doing?
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
Right.
Uh.... No. Not really.
Were you pleased with his work?
That's correct.
I might.
Second.
You're the asshole, buddy.
How many do you know?
Since when?
Is there some kind of expression I've picked up from Beckett?! Some kind of fairy attitude I've unconsciously adopted?! Am I walking different?! Some kind of vocal thing?! Have I picked up some kind of homo <u>vibe</u>?!
Very funny. I had a box of Pampers under my arm for Chrissake!
Yeah... ?
Going on... like...?
Like... two sailors playing hide the salami.
We stuck his head in the latrine, after ten of us had used it.
Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
Hold it, Joe.  He wants to come back to work, Chuck.
He was doing a great job.
He died fast. And if we got any choice, that's the way we should all go out.  Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.
It's a fucking staircase! Go over it! GO OVER IT!
It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just....
What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta. What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt, so I used it to catch a little run-off. Metallic taste to it, human blood. Coppery. But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. Course, that's more for winter. Summertime, I take mine straight.
Show me your eyes.
Look deeper.
Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.
So everybody huddles together till the lights burn out? Until you can't see what's eating you? That the big plan?
Riddick? How close?
But they...they could still be....
I know what's in here!
I think I twisted my ankle running backwards like that. And I'm not sure I can....  Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to be alone back there anymore. If you could just give me a few minutes up front here --
I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
Probably right.
Shut up.
Like what?
Thought you didn't believe his story.
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
-- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we <u>know</u> we're ready to launch.
<u>You</u> made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.
Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact.
Because you're 79 kilos of gutless white meat, and <u>that's</u> why you can't come up with a better plan.
So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
You mean that "load" of passengers?
He will be with us. Nonetheless.
All deserts have water, somewhere. God shall lead us there.
Please...this solves nothing...please....
Listen to her? <u>Her</u>? When she was willing to sacrifice us all?
Here's the deal. You work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. You help us get off this rock....
Said "looks clear."
Like who, Mr. Chrislam?
Yes, sir, so it was -- thanks to you. But not before I discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the Sacred Scrolls were written ...
Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
And now you know the truth.  Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have.
Remembers what?
Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
Zira, listen to me. We've got a fine future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise --
Good question.  Landon -- check your communications kit.
No.
None at all.
Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.
He's trying to form words.
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
It's a fact, Landon. Buy it. You'll sleep better.
I'm prepared to die.
Oh, and one last item. Immortality. You wanted to go on forever.  Well, you damn near made it. Except for Dodge and me, you've lived longer than anybody. And with Stewart dead, it looks like we're the last of the strain. You got what you wanted, kid. How does it taste?
Zira doesn't want your female.
I'll start by following the shoreline.  And my nose.
All right...  Get in...hurry.  Put this on.
I know it's a man. And you know the rules. No animals outside the compound, and most certainly not without a leash.
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
Then you admit --
I don't know.
If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.
Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
That's lunacy. I can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that's equally as inventive as yours. But it would be conjecture, not proof.
Cease fire! Withdraw!
Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.
No, thanks. I'll take freedom.
The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.
She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant.
Except that he's also the Chief Defender of the Faith.
God bless you.
Where are they now?
YOU AIN'T A FIRING SQUAD, YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!
C'mon man, didn't I do you right that time I give you the turkey loaf for the ham and lima beans shit.
Whaddaya talking shit for man. Hey Junior! Y'ever smoke any shit?
Sure, you probably stick it in tween her knees and think youse there.
Fuck this shit! I ain't dyin' in no white man's war! Ise didi-ing this motherfuckah!
I got one...
Over here!
Hey take it easy man. They're scared.
Dawn...
And you, do you believe?
No... I move faster alone. 
Here have some of this. Won't feel a thing.
Go on, whatcha gotta lose, yo' here now...
Who gives a shit!
Y'ever get caught in a mistake King and you just can't get out of it?
Not just me... it's the way the whole thing works. People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it! We just don't add up to dry shit.
Forty-two days man and a wakeup and I'm a gone motherfucker. Back to de WORLD. 
Found it. Growing in a garden.
If you're gonna do it man, 'least do it right.
That's what he is... Baaaa!
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it, Mr. Mitchell.
Vancouver, B.C.
Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.
Maybe you're going to have to like me.
Whatever you say.
Do you think I don't?
He doesn't even know half the people who come up to drink his liquor.
There's one less tonight.
How did you meet him?
It's always a mistake to run away. Always.
I'm different. I like it fine.
From you, I like it.
There's another man--right outside the booth here.  I never saw him Before.
Larry Mitchell found out.  So you killed him.
So could you.  But our records were a little against us.
I guess I'm a little screwy.  Maybe I could believe it.  Should I try?
Who'd believe it but you?  I took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  Even if they find him, what connects him with me?
Would I want to?
If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself?  Oh, I don't mean with the gun. This is no trick.  When I wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either.  It's not so hard for me as you think. I'm not crying about it, I've been skating close to it for quite some time.  The water is cold down there--  But so is everything else.  And there's you.
If I did-I don't-now.
Beer?  Well, all right.
Beer or ale, Miss?
That's an evasion and you know it.
Where's you get it?
Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.
You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.
The police always do, don't they?
There isn't anything you can do.
Very ridiculous.
What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself.
That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?
You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
I don't know whether to knock your teeth down your throat--or call the police--or just give you twenty bucks to go out and buy yourself a clean nose.
For five hundred, what do I get?
The new ones are fine. The last set I had gave me all kinds of trouble.
That's what I thought, at first.  Maybe somebody else ought to have thrown this party.  With my liquor of course.
Could we discuss that some other time?
Or just drunk enough.  He was with her when she registered.  He knew where her room was.  You were out most of the evening.  There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going, the door standing open.  Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just below yours.
You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
What?
I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners.
Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
That's not enough.
I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.
They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.
Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.
Recently, then.
You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.
Thanks, Inspector.  What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
Go live in a tent.
It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
Talk English.  How do I know you're you?
So the shell ought to have gone over?
Unless the gun was slanted up.
Gigi, huh?  Sounds French--one of those fancy ladies.  Must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold.
If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.
You've got a dead man on your hands. Like this.
I've handled it.  Mitchell's handed it.  If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide.  If I leave it here....no suicide.
Thank you very much, Mrs. West.
She might.
So-so.
She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
You ought to know why.
Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me?
It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
I have no intension of being nasty, Mr. Mitchell.
Tom, Daddy would like to see you in the garden.  And will you ask Betty to bring us some coffee. And remember to say 'please'.
If we leave the remembering to historians then the struggle is already lost.  Everyone must have a memory, everyone needs to be a historian.  In this country, for example, we're in danger of losing hard-won freedoms by dozing off in a perpetual present.
If you like.  But don't be too modest, James.  The citizen's duty is to remember, not necessarily to write books.  You are highly qualified.  You're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job.  Every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history.  A genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you.
Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends.
She'll be here next weekend.  Why don't you come too, James?  I'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.
We'll see you next week, and if--
Yes.
Thank you.
Freshman and sophomores...
I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
Too bad.  What did your father do?
That must be rather nice, in a way.  I mean, you don't have any--
Who?
Well, you know...
Two or three years ago I would have stayed.  And fucked you.
I haven't really thought about it.
No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
What did he want?
That'll be fun
The torture of small children--
I'm waiting for your mother.
She said awfully sorry, make yourself comfortable, she won't be long. .
Why not sit down and wait?
Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?
And Joe Ramage - do you remember him?  He comes and helps out in the shop.
Well, it's worth seeing.
Now listen...
Two years of surgery.  I missed my window.  Limped through law school instead.
Only make bets I can't afford to lose.  Only way to be 100% committed.
Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
Yeah, I noticed you limping.  But don't worry about it, brah. Don't worry at all.  We're not gonna land on land!
After you, Alfonse.  I insist!
Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can I do for you?
Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over.
Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
Got it...
Patience hotshot.  Patience.  It'll be subtle, if it's here at all.
No way.  Not yet.  Come on.
Nothing.
No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--
This gonna take long?
No.  I'm sorry.  I have to go. I'll, uh... I'll call you later. I'm sorry.
Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
You never did know when to quit.
Like the old days, Dillon.
Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.
Anytime.
Those eyes... disappeared. But I know one thing, Major...  ... I drew down and fired right at it. Capped-off two hundred rounds and then the Mini-gun; the full pack. Nothin'... nothin' on this earth could have lived... not at that range.
I saw it.
Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
Thunder's a horse.  Come on.
Who indeed...
I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
How are you, Mr. Kross.
What's that?
You're not from L.A., huh?
New York.
Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
So do day jobs.
They should be.  They're both good at it.
Vivian... the meter's running... cooperate.
If I want you to turn me on I'll pay <u>you</u> three hundred.  Just lay back and let me drive.
Don't drown.
The Rex.
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
Shush.  Of course you can.
You mean, besides Elvis?  I'm a human being.  Sure.  Once. First time I ever ran away from home, I got as far as Atlanta. I met this boy.  He'd been with his parents on their way to Chicago.  They stopped at a gas station.  He went to the john. When he came back they'd split. We sorta started looking out for each other.  Aw, he was sweet. And boy, was he good looking, y'know, dark hair and eyes. The chicken hawks were on him all the time.  He hated that. Sometimes we'd find a safe place to crash nights and we'd curl up together and we'd talk about all these crazy things.  The two of us getting married someday. Having kids.  Stupid stuff.
But don't they have it in English?
Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know.  That's the fun of it.
I more than liked it.
I know.  Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being stupid.  I'll think about it, okay?  It's a real good offer for a whore.
I've never treated you like a whore.
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.
Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.
Vivian...
It's not your fault.  You're right.  Kit's right.  But I want the fairy tale.
I have a message for you from your "niece", sir.
Apologize to Elizabeth for me.
Come on, you can tell me.  I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this.
The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions.
Doing what?
Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.
We'll be there.  Listen, if he's really caving in, we'll go from there down to the office.  I want him to commit his stock to us this morning.
Edward, we've been together ten years.
I bet.  That was our rent!
I will.  I'm trying.  Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high?
He's not gonna want us.
Why'd he want you?
Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
What do you know?  You look <u>good</u>. All dressed up.  You clean up real nice.  You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do.  Not that you ever did anyway.
You think I fit here where they just about chew your food for you?
Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
Certain ladies make that very easy... Vivian.  John, call a limousine for our guest, please.  Have it take her anywhere she wishes to go.  Bill the hotel.  See you again sometime soon.
All this must be quite a change from Hollywood Boulevard.
You survived the Fire Swamp. You must be very brave...  ... but nobody withstands The Machine. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           69.
May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
I suggest a deal. You write four copies of a letter. I'll send my four fastest ships. One in each direction. The Dread Pirate Roberts is always close to Florin this time of year. We'll run up the white flag and deliver your message. If Westley wants you, bless you both. If not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide. Are we agreed?
You're a silly girl.
Should I be?
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you
He knows I do not love him.
As you wish.
Hear this now: I will come for you.
I will never doubt again.
You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.
What?
It never happened. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
-- I do not accept excuses.  I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini.  Which way is my way?
Yeah?
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
What?
I'll be right back.
Oh. Well, thank you very much. It's very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right.  The Princess Bride, by S. Morgenstern. Chapter One. Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin.
-- well, when does it get good?
What is it? What's the matter? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.
Yes.
I don't mind so much.
Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
Try ruling the world sometime.
I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
The loser ran off alone.  The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder!
Of course.
Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work. But, I've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75.
I thought he was with you.
-- offer me money --
Sorry.
Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so.
You know what a hurry we're in.
For the Princess?
I will. And I choose --
Nobody's hearing nothing!
Congratulations.
Well, sir, it seems ...
It's nothing ... nothing.
What???
What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you?
I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
Two pistachios, my good man.
You found a flop!
What is she gonna do here?
But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.
Why don't we go over to the theatre and see what's really happening? After all, we've only heard from a small portion of the audience. Let's hear what the majority thinks.
Shut up.
What are you doing?  We're trapped. It's either the show or us.  There's no way out.  What can we do, blow up the theatre?
We loved it.  We thought it was a masterpiece.  That's why we're here. We want to produce it on Broadway.
Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
That's exactly why we want to do this play.  To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart. 
Yes.  We would!
I'm not crazy.  I'm inept.
Yes.  Amazing isn't it?
No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.
Thursday.  Thursday.  We'll play Thursday.  We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.
Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.
Good.  That's enough.  We'll do the rest on Thursday.  That's a good girl.  It's always such fun to see you.
I shall count the minutes.
Goodbye, my angel ... My angel!  Hey, touch me ... wait!  Hey, uh ... Lucretia, Lucretia!
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
We can't... we keep our money there!
No! Of all...
How do you know she didn't make a call?
My mother.
Of course not.
Now, look...!
All right!  Might save me a lot of leg-work if I could just talk to your mother.  But I'd need a warrant for that, won't I?
Of course not. Please.
Well... heck, this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred.
I'd like to be ready when he gets back.
It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
A lot?
Forty thousand dollars.
With the forty thousand dollars?
Go out there! Find somebody, ask some questions!  I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to you. I keep thinking... something's wrong. I have to know what!
I don't know.
I want to know if my sister is here.
Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...
I was getting to that!
I hate tears. 
No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.
I ought to call the police right now!
She'll need both of us.
Where's the old highway?
Arbogast said...
Alive.
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?
There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy! 
We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!
I thought I'd gotten off the main...
I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
You should... mind it.
I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to sound uncaring...
You're not going to... to your room already?
You slept here all night?
No, m'am.
Is anything wrong?
Norman took a wife?
Arbogast.
Yes.
And now that your mother's dead?
And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
From what?
What--special autopsy?
Just before she died she came to--
Did she talk?
[Was it] &quot;Meirschultz&quot;?
Indeed, he has often told me.
[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
Then you knew of the inheritance?
Dr. Meirschultz, too?
Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night.
Sure, got thousand cats, too. Look at 'em-- Points to cages of cats.
Oh, nothing. He is crazy, that's all. I had a little trouble with him.
The wound is bleeding!
Yes!
Another fragment of the diary is shown [having to do with vampires].
But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
Yeah, but they leave you plenty.
Well, I do say it.
They are.  My boy, I think you are right. Everyone is tired out today and now that we have seen my doors open in a new country, I am beginning to realize that I am a little tired myself. You can call that fellow in from the front. I think we'll close for the night.
And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
Are you giving me this straight?
You mean he was colored?
Great. Consider yourself crippled -- financially. See if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on.
Well, anyway, he couldn't have copped that body -- he was in jail.
Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
Well, no one would ever suspect it. You don't sound right.
Now don't that call for an extra!
About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
What do you mean?
You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?
I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
Come on, old man, that won't do. You know you're innocent until proven guilty.
Cry-baby?
My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back. 
That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
Dysfunctional --
Oh, Mother, not the castor oil.
Buddy, I am wandering in a wilderness, lost.  I just feel awful. Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?
Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
What did you expect?
'Course it does.
Well, nothin'.
Rose, if you don't keep your boyfriends away from the house, Daddy is going to fire you.
But I don't know who they are.
You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat.
He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?
Yeah, I'd believe it.
You won't die, Rose.
What are you going to do, Rose?
Five hundred rabbits?
Yep, we had 'em in orange crates all over. It was Daddy's dream. He was goin' to get rich raisin' rabbits. It was what killed Daddy. He didn't drown hisself till a long time later after Momma and Lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him.
She's got somebody in there, Brother! His shoes are on the back porch -- there they were, naked and smiling at me!  Rose, open this door immediately!
Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!
No, he doesn't. Not really.
Boy! Wow!
He kissed her.
Buddy, that was my place.
So am I.
Rose says she's goin' to have a baby and she sure looks it, but I don't think so.
Yeah, they're in the snow.
I'm older than hell, boy. But this Yankee whisky is mighty fine, I'll say that.
Well, if it isn't malignant and she can get through the operation all right, it might be better than her really being pregnant. She doesn't even know who the father might have been.
Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
I have of course observed the girl in treating her.
I think we both know her.
Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.
There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why.
Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
It's because of the children she's got to go. I don't want to be holier-than-thou, but the girl doesn't have the same outlook we do. Morals don't mean a thing to her, not a thing, and we can't have a girl like that in this house.
Something has got to be done or Rose is going to be in this house forever.
I can't believe you really meant it, if I did I'd want to die. You aren't a male monster, that man is but you aren't. Look me in the eye and tell me, do you really want to take Rose's womanhood away from her when it's all she has got?
I'm afraid it's my fault. I made her feel guilty this morning --  Brother, what are you doing up?
Who?
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
Yes, sir. I had to go to the bathroom.
Oh, I'll just mosey around here and there.
Yes, sir.
I'm not hungry.
Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled.
Oh, no, sir.
Yes, air.
Where is he? Where have you got him hid?  Ah, ha!
Well, it's Billy.
Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very poor, he don't have no money and there wasn't no place else to go.
Well, it was a silly question.
Yes, sir.
Mine.
Perfect, wonderful, good as I ever felt! Except for a big old scar on my stummick, I wouldn't even know I been in the hospital.
Well, we know you were there. The bill that hospital sent was absolutely horrendous.
What was it, Mr. Hillyer?
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
Near Alexandria. It isn't in Alexandria, it is outside it.
She's te reason -- cured me of women once and for all. Oh, I got rid of her, Buddy, I didn't waste no time kickin' that bitch out. Hell, she was screwin' everybody in Savannah. I caught her in a motel with this long tall son of a bitch and boy did I beat the everlastin' piss out of him!
I'm only trying to help him, Mother.
Afraid of the hospital?
I beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? Do you mean "epi-zoo-ot-tics," an animal epidemic?
We make our own lives, Madam. As for malignancy, I don't think so, it's very unlikely. I probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her.
Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
Rose, really, you shouldn't act like that.
Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...
Careful she doesn't hit her head on the way.
Lay off once, would you?
That wasn't my fault.
No you can't.
Hands off the suit, monkey-boy. Close your eyes if you're scared.
I can not even begin to imagine how much that must have hurt.
You're just saying nothing!  Tonight is the night.
The ones you got in that fist-fight with a couple a weeks ago... ?
Name one.
Dean Martin.
It's just the way things are, kiddo.
Bullshit.
What was I supposed to do?
Just keep an eye out till I get this rig up and running.
Okay.  It doesn't smell as bad in here as I remember it smelling.
General Jim Beam, then.
Where have you been?
You mean taking bribes, and skimming busts and letting hoods walk? You mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest Joe?
Well, sir...
Don't bother.  This behavior's gone on too long.  You're suspended.
Till the last firework fizzles out tonight, detective, you sit a desk. And, after that, I'll decide if you keep your shield.
Second of all, the Declaration of Independence was all for liberty and equality, but it didn't do anything about slavery, did it?
No you're not.
No, we are <U>not</U> going to do that.
That's not true.
I know it is, even if you don't.
There's not even enough places to stash it in a car.
We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.  Told you they'd do it!
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
Leia! Leia's my sister.
Jabba's palace.
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.
Hold me.
All right, hang on.
Let's see.
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
Here goes nothing.
Then you know why I have to face him.
I will not fight you, father.
Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for...
Your father he is.
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
Didn't we pass a castle back down the road a few miles?  Maybe they have a telephone I might use.
There's no point both of us getting wet.
So come up to the Lab.
Free to try and find a game
Dealing
No no no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Ain't your fault -- Here's the problem.
Shell-shocked!
I think mebbe we're early or somethin' --
...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after.
I sold them to you.
I should leave.
But I'm willin' to make the best of this uncomfortable situation.
Ya puttin' me on, right?
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
Don't want weak legs.
Paulie, please --
Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop 'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.' Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn monster movie!!
I'll carry him 'till the third.
People nothin', you in a fight, my man, -- ya best believe what you hear... Knock that boy out soon an' let's go home.
He's movin' to your left -- don't let him no more -- dance and stick, hear? Don't play -- I know what ya feelin', but don't play.
Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?
How 'bout this Big Chuck Smith?
Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor --
That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
...No wine -- Bad for ya' brain.
Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
...Yeah, give 'er the Blades.
Charge it.
Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.
Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.
What about for food an' stuff?
It don't matter. It's my reputation. These guys think they can get off light. It's bad for my reputation -- It's bad for business. See ya killer.
Yeah.
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
Hey -- if a good man can make a better life, let him make it.
I feel bad about walkin'.
Same thing. Ya know, Rock, remember when we was kids, we fought together. An' I wasn't well an' ya had to beat up that Irish kid -- what's his name? -- Gallager -- I bought a suit and became a businessman. You put on gloves. An' I remember Mama almost cried, may she rest in peace -- an' our ol' man who said ya had no brains --I'd like to lay hands on that bastard. You ain't never had any luck. Even when I owned you in '66 you never had luck. But now I think you might be gettin' some luck kid. Whatta you think?
...Thanks.
Mr. Balboa --
Rocky.
Sure, an' I'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the Champ. He's just there to help condition the man.
What?
Ya, somethin' like that.
'Night, Marie.
Yeah.
Listen, I'm gonna take a steam -- Did good last night -- Shoulda seen it.
Think about it.
Ya puttin' me on?
Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin' here? Here, sit down.
Yeah.
Rocky, d'ya know what I done?
...What?
Heart, but I ain't got no Tocker.
Rocky, I'm seventy-six years old. Maybe you can be the winner I never was -- your shot is my last shot!
Whatta you get outta this?
Yo, can I have my locker back?
The owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago.
I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
Gazzo's gotta come to you -- Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job -- Do what you do now.
Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd break his lips.
Ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know.
Without havin' good people around, ya won't have such a good chance.
The story -- what's happenin'?
Feel? I dunno... Happy.
Listen, I wanna say hi to my girlfriend -- Yo, Adrian!
I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
That's right, a tweeting bird.  But what does the script say?  'Rabbit gets conked.  Rabbit sees <u>stars</u>!'  Not birds, stars!
Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?
Maroon, right?
I'll bet.
The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
Earl... it's me, Valiant.
Toon cops worked me over.
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?
So what?  He's already put me three weeks behind on the shooting schedule!
You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.
Aren't you the lucky one...
Frankly, I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years.
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
Take it easy.
Divorce?  Never!
Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will.
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?
My brother.  Get inside.
What is this, Twenty Questions?
Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.
I rest my case.
Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
[Aside to GREGORY] Is the law on our side, if I say ay?
Uh? Uh?
Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh! O, Romeo that she were An open ass, and thou a poperin pear! Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed; This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
Why, what is Tybalt?
Am I like Such a fellow?
By my heel, I care not.
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here's much to do with hate, but more with love. Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O any thing, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness! Serious vanity! Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! Feather of lead-- [Benvolio Snickers] Dost thou not laugh?
A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
Teach me how I should forget to think.
Art thou hurt?
The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.
Here is my gold. Worse poison to men's souls, than these poor compounds that thou mayest not sell.
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter now. We must entreat the time alone.
What if this mixture do not work at all? Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
Goodnight.
O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your messages yourself.
Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
A thousand times good night! Exit, above
Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
Peace, good Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing.
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
Courage man, the hurt can not be much.
A Plague o' both your houses.
Could you not take some occasion without giving?
Is she a Capulet?
Always in a rush, you are.  All these years I've known you, you could never wait for anything.
Of course.
Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
We weren't real thrilled about it either...
You don't have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre.
I don't know...  Well I don't!  It's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you.  But I do know who we're working for.  My people, and the Russian mob.
Exactly.  Gregor, he was the Russian's man.  It was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the Russians who had the capital to finance it.  Gregor, he was their insurance, and I was ours. Everybody else was supposed to be neutral.  Gregor must've got to Swede...
Bloody fucking hell...
In this business, your life and your reputation are more often than not one and the same.
Don't do it, Sam!
I take it you still want the money...
Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.
I don't have it with me...
Then where is it?
I sent it to myself in Paris.
What I do is none of your concern.  What you should do is wait for my next phone call.  I'm going to find a place where I can tilt the field in my favor.  When I'm ready, I'll call you and tell you what I want you to do.
I hadn't thought about it.  Understand me, Gregor -- I take no pleasure in killing.  It doesn't bother me one bit, but I don't get off on it.
What's that?
Nobody's going to do that!
Really?
If he hadn't you'd have put a bullet in his head a long time ago.
But first you have something to take care of?
Something important?  A thing that cannot wait?
A Samurai has honor, a Samurai live by the code of Bushido, the way of the warrior.  I'm just a killer for hire.  The world isn't about honor, anymore. It's about survival.
All in the stomach, though.  Your man might live.
Long enough to shoot back.
Is that right?
What makes you think we're here to meet you?
Who else would you be?
I know cops -- and you're no cop.
I asked if we could give him anything else.
Jujitsu.
Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
There is that.
Know what?
I've seen a lot of people die before.
I haven't.  Not like that.  How do you get used to it?
My job, Vincent, a job you don't need to know about.  I can't go to the local cops -- they'd never be able to get close enough at this point.  It's me or nobody, and I've been on this job too goddamned long not to finish.
Yes.
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
It's my job.
It is at that.
I never made that claim.
I don't know...
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
Something like that.
The mark of a true Samurai.  What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do.  We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job.
You better get some sleep, alright?
What happened to it?
I guess that's for the best.
Just to keep me company, Sam -- I hate smoking alone.  How about you?  I thought all you IRA types smoked.
How is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us?
You put everything on the line because you...
Doing well.  This is?
A friend.  I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
I hear you.
He would have won more but he blew it at the end.  Didn't know what Cash and Carry was.
They're out of towners... Arizona plates...
Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
Because...I know.
Maybe.  Who cares?
All right we will.
What are you gonna do?
You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
That's not what I mean.
Forget it.  We're going to bury it, and we're not going to even think about it until everything dies down.  And no one, I mean no one hears a word about it.	 Understand?
Man take it easy!  You're sweating like crazy!
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
What are you thinking?
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note	or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's just a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
For Christ's sake, Booth, I just needed to take care of a few debts is all!  You got my word on it --I'm not going near it again until everything cools down.
No.
Well what are we supposed to do?
I don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. Booth looks at Earl --
You killed him...
Then Sally comes too.
I'm all ears.
Hello.
No.  Why?
Are you sure you're OK?
I love you too.
Dwayne got a little tipsy is all. He doesn't handle pressure well.  It's over.
I used to think he was something, once...  I was eighteen, I didn't know any better, and he had something steady to offer.
I swear to you, it's true...
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
Well I don't know...
I mean at least pick a more discreet place, the scalp, under the armpit, under the tongue, someplace where the trained eye wont immediately look.
Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
About what?
I  have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
Forget it.
Watch that.  Watch that tone.
Not much to tell.  Nothing really happened.
Save me the sermon.  I've heard it all before, it's boring.
Dwayne -
Then what the hell are you all about?
What?
Listen -
Well you can't have it.
Yeah.
Money.
There was more than that.
What do you think?  Heart attack?
Those are five hundred dollar chips.
Two-hundred thousand!
And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how that works out.  I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down.
James, you see my kids back there?  You know how much I'm paying for private school?  How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather?
Is this about the funny money?
Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
I don't want to play games with you, Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes.
Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
The real question is, where are the plates?  If we can find the plates, we can stop the whole operation.
That's Chief Inspector, he got promoted.
C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won, now just put the gun down.
Never leave home without it.  Lee, this one's on me.  You save your money.
You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.
Mu-shu?  You're hungry?
You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner last night.
You.
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.
No.  She's a school teacher.
-- but if somebody gave me the chance to square up my father's death, I'd go to hell to do it.
He'll be back soon.
Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
Excuse me?
I'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice.  You want some ice?
I don't want to hear this.
No, I don't believe this shit -- it's a microphone.  Lee, she's wired...
There's people up here!
Get it out of here!
You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly.
You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.
I'll remember that next time I'm fighting a box.
Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass from here to Compton.
What is Mac out?
I'll give it my best shot.
No problem.
It's okay, I got lots more.
Amen to that, brother.
I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?
Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
I'm undercover.  I had no choice.  You have to trust me.
Just trying to make it look real.
Now you know.
Let him find out on his own.  I want the Hong Kong police handling this.
Don't.
Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong.
Put the plates down.  It's over.
I know, Master, but...
Put a diaper on him, Chin.  I want to talk to the great Inspector Lee.
So was I.
Witnesses.
Let me just clarify a few things.  I don't care what kind of cop you are in China, you have no jurisdiction in America.  Without me you are just another tourist.
What plate?
He was trying to kill me, not you.
What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama.  So where the hell am I from? Kenya?
It happens.
No, no.  I'm full. Too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas.  scuse me.
You know War?
Excuse me?
FBI calls up my ass, says they need help in Tokyo.  Like I'm supposed to drop everything.
No shark fin, no camel hump.  What you listenin' to?
In Charge.  Just me'n him.  No interference.  They don't even want to hear from us until we're done.  I love the F.B.I.  I love the F.B.I.
It's okay. For restaurants.
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...
And your buddy, Mr. Lee, is on his way back to China.  Now, get out. Before I file obstruction of justice charges against you.
Shut up!
Or somethin'.
He is very good.
And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?
I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.
I was trying to find the right time.
I'm just bragging about how great you are.  I'm the luckiest man alive.
Got any last minute advice?
Good one!  Thanks.
Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.
See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
Or a vegetarian?
"Paid vindication"  That's what I call justice.
Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?!
Why do YOU think she ran?
Oh, please!
Good fact.  Well, you let me know.
Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --
Oh, come on.  You're practically family.
Nervous?  Not at all!  No.  I've never been more certain in my life.  Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams.
I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got to get back to work.  I still have my job.
Twice...
Really?
Nothing like sharing your nuptial bed with two Sherpas and a yak.
I'm not a boastful man.  What's your point?
Done.
I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
Still sweet.
Wrenches.  My dad's gonna love that one.
That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
No you don't.  You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem.  You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say.  Am I right?
Me?
I'm listening.
Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
"And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance.  So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground"  Holy moly.
No.
Nope.
Boats.  All anyone talks about is the wind.  Is it up, is it down.  I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
It's not a boat boat.  It's really a house.
It's delicious, trust me.
When you get back, I'll be gone --
It's just like my grandmother's china.
At the top of the Empire State Building --
That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.
"Dear Sleepless and Son..."
I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
No.
Turn on your radio!
Definitely.
No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
He said hello.
"Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."
Okay.
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
Come on, Jonah --
Yes.
Howard.
Annie, when you meet someone and you're attracted to them, it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious, subconsciously.  So what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match.
You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
Magic.
Hello.
The cabinets have to be redone --
And I don't want to invade your privacy --
It's not that late in Seattle.
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
I'm not asking you to set me up, Jay.  That's not what I need your help for.  I want to know what it's like over there.
You mean, like, "He has the cutest butt"? Where did I hear that recently?
I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.
What is it?
This is going to be tougher than I thought.
I don't get it.
It's a spice rack.
Dad --
She's willing to fly anywhere.
Good.
Not now, Jonah --
WAIT!!!  -- "and while we're on the subject, let's just say right now that Brooks Robinson was the best third baseman ever. It's important that you agree with me on that because I'm from Baltimore."  Dad, she thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
There she is.
I was thirsty.
Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
Are you going with her?
You're kidding --
I've already solved it.  I've hired a hit man.
He's good at it.
Why didn't you give a warning signal?
There's nothing stopping you.
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
So? What does he want to do about 'em?
Hush... not a word about the cake, hear?
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
Aaah, what's the use?
He'll have it good. Some day.
Sure.
I've had them since the day they were born.
Shut up, you're talking crazy.
And if you can't understand this you're a fool -- because you can't win this strike without me! You can't win anything without me!
Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
Me, I'm a camp follower -- following this organizer from one mining camp to another -- Montana, Colorado, Idaho. But did he ever think to organize the women? No. Wives don't count in the Anglo locals either.
Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?
Papa! We seen 'em! Two scabs! Over there!
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...
My kids don't have enough to eat!
You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
Are you Australian?
How about in the house?
Now that's down-right insulting.
Everything go?
This man sounds like a real catch.
Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?
You get off on abuse or something?
Fuck you.
Because he'll kill me.
I can't. I've got a kid.  She lives with my parents.  Quincey knows where they live.
Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
It's me.
I'm kind of busy.
Find a new job.
Look, maybe you oughta' leave.
Danny, it's not what you think.
Your daughter needs you.  Go.
I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.
You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.
I hadn't noticed.  I've seen you around.  What's your name?
Well, Jimmy the Finn, let's go score some gack.
I guess there's just no substitute for good genes.
Can you set that up?
You mean, like to throw 'em off?
You're going to have to explain that one.
Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.  It's for you.
That was my idea.
Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.
The good stuff.  Can you handle that?
No, I'm good.
If you say so.
Why do you say that?
Uh-uh-uh ...
What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0?
Somebody has to help you lazy bastards.
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
Standard vig.  Minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory.
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
To who?
And what does this have to do with me?
Several possession charges, but nothing major.
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
Worse. Much worse.  A teacher.
I was talking about Miles.
Just no pleasing you, is there?
We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There.  You happy?
Yeah.  This could be the one we're looking for.
Better than drugs.
A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.
There's a Private James Ryan who parachuted in with the Hundred-and- First near Ramelle.  I want you to take a squad up there.  If he's alive, bring him back to the beach for debarkation.  Take whoever you need, you've got your pick of the company.
Spit it out, Captain.
We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County.  I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry.
Hell, no.  I think he's the best officer in the whole goddamned army, bar none.
Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain has a mother.
I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent.
That's not all.  There were nine gunners on the eighty-eights, one had a broken heel on his boot, two had bratwurst for supper last night, one of them is named Fritz, the other, Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard to tell.
I've been humming it.
The men said, nine.
What do they know?  I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.
I changed my mind.
Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
Okay, Wade.  Translators?
Fresh out.
We in radio contact with anybody up there?
Hell of a mission.
Tell that to Private James Ryan. We've got our orders.  Let's go.
Nope.
Good news?
How about you shut up and take your position?
About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal.
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
Let's just find someplace.
Trust me, you're the best.
Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?
We can't leave it here.
Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.
Get back to your positions!
More tanks...  Ryan Lot's of them The fear on their faces turns to resignation.  They know that they are dead men.  They settle into their positions, and prepare to fire and die.
Alright, come with me.
No, private, I want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid.
...for you to blow up, yeah, yeah, we heard that.
Captain, he's fast!
We know.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
It's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example...
You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
Mr Court, be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates...
Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?
He's a mess!
I just washed this shirt, didn't I?
Okay, I got it.
I am.
Come on, it's graduation.
He wants to leave things on a good note.
Well, where Mr Carroll uses the word 'love', I look for a new word.
And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.
Alright.
Oh no, no, it's... it's wonderful.   It's... no, don't worry about it.  You're very funny.  Go back, that's great!
No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?
We'll worry about that later.  Now come on, tell me that you're special.
Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
Dad.
Dad, I'm sorry.
Do you wanna make things easier on me?  Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit.  You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.
Well then don't pick it up. You know what's best.
Alright, alright.  Go ahead.  When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.
No, I will.  I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you.  You're a liar, and a thief.
This is me telling you about me.
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
Yeah.  What a day.
Look Diane, I'm sorry, but I can't allow you to leave the country without going to Valhere's graduation party.  This gentleman, he's twenty-two, and he comes out of hiding once a year for this occasion, and he dresses up as the Lakeside rooster, and he,
I'll go.
They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.
No.
No, I'm serious.
Yeah, I've had it forever.  I used to have this thing with marking the words that I looked up.
Mmmm.
Me?  Sure I do.
Friends with potential.
Yes.  Are you shaking?
I don't think so.
Say what?
No I didn't.
No.
You told your dad?
What, I'm sorry I said that.  Forget I said it, it's what I thought I meant, but forget it.
Then don't do it.
I love you.  How many more times do I have to say it?
Good to know.
No my brother, you have to go buy your own.
Oh.  Okay then... Lloyd Dobler, 555-1342.
How do you pay for one of those?
Seriously, Lloyd.
I know.
I know
Very talented.
You're not a permanent part of her life.  You're a distraction.
Just her name.
What?
We'll just make an appointment for you at Seattle Junior College.
How many people really know what they want though?  I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know.  But I know that I don't know.
We're full on bonded.
Things worked out.  I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.
Itzhak Stern?  He's on the list.
I'd say I'd get you one but the guy who made it, he's probably dead, I don't know.
They're mine!
It's good for me - I know them, I'm familiar with them.  It's good for you - you'll be compensated.  It's good for the Army.  You know what I'm going to make?  Artillery shells.  Tank shells. They need that.  Everybody's happy.
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
Wine?
It kind of looks that way.
Pistols, rifles, carbines ...  I'd be grateful.
I think most people right now have other priorities.
Yes.
The war could end.
There's a machinist outside who'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job.
Ah, yes.
Thank you.
Well, I'll talk to somebody.  I'll take care of it.
They're withholding payment.
You don't?  I do.  I see a difference.
You did so much.
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
There's taking money and there's taking money, you know that.  He's taking money.
That doesn't work, sir.
Take the neighborhood.
Broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre. This is too much fun for one person.
Where?
That's smart.
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
Who is this?
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
I did that.
Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo.
I'll get my jacket.
Youre not going to get away with this.
Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?
He hates Oliver Stone.
Youd me amazed at how many of us there are out there. Its a whole world, Sid. Youre really popular amongst the demented.
Youre the one who got away.
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
And now, drum roll please...
Miss Weathers.
I know that.
Billy had alibis too.
The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Humor me, Sid.
I'm everywhere.
Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way.
The safety what? Fuck that!
Is Sid in therapy?
I'll cover you through rehearsal. Derek when do you get outta docu- drama?
I'd really just like to be alone.
It's not a good idea, Hallie.
Easy black boy.
What's your favorite scary movie?
I gotta coupla of those buttons myself.
Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.
And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either but I'm really concerned about my safety now.
Do I?
What?!
No! You listen to me, if you're not where I want you in fifteen minutes I'll hollow her out. Do you understand?
Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?
He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!  DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!
Alright, calm down. I'm going to radio in for backup right now.
Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something?
I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' know who my mom was.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.
Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news.
Oh yeah, how?
Yeah. A real tragedy.
What does this have to do with Sid?
What Rielly?
Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
Where are you Dewey?
Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?
You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
You used to say that was our strength.
Someone stole Sid's file?
Has anyone else every used your phone?
I work better alone.  Why don't you do some snooping around the set?
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
Honestly, my life.
I dunno but I can tell you that your's will be the home video footage of me sticking my foot up your ass! Now come out and fight like a real man you pussy!
You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
Bitch.
Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go. It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.
Are you saying she was-
I know! He killed Kincaid!
Huh, fine.
Page 22..  Ring ring.  Hello?
Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number.
It is in my script.
SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. "What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".
Who is this?
How do I know their voices are --
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
No I need to call you. Just you.
Who the fuck is this?
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending.
She looked dead. Still does.
I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay...
Then what is it? Is there somebody else?
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
You lost your mom...
Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?
To apologize.
You're forgiven. Bye now.
Wait, wait, don't hang up.
Do you like scary movies?
Gotta go.
Don't...
To talk.
No-bored.
NO, YOU LISTEN, YOU LITTLE BITCH. IF YOU HANG UP ON ME AGAIN I'LL GUT YOU LIKE A FISH. UNDERSTAND?
Or else what?
Sure...
So you better leave.
His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?
Turn off the light.
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
You never know when or where a story will break.
Mind if I join you?
Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.
Sidney's father?
You can't be here, Tatum. This is an official crime scene.
Don't be so self-righteous. It's just a little blow out -- we'll be perfectly safe.
Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.
Yeah.
How is everything?
What were you doing out here?
She's tough.
Yes, sir, sheriff.
She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
As long as it records I don't give a shit. We're not doing a remote.
I owe you shit.
Have you talked to Cotton?
But couldn't it have been someone else you saw wearing that coat? The same person who planted it in Cotton's car, framing him? The same person who really killed your mother?
Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed them both in a jealous rage.
Uh-huh.
LEAVEMEALONE!
You coming tonight?
You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
The why'd the police let him go?
Because he's probably dead. His body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere... eyes gauged. See, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time. There's formula to it. A very simple one. Everyone's always a suspect -- the father, the principal, the town derelict...
He came to make up.
There goes my chance with Sid.
You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
What happened?
How do you gut someone?
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
I'm not worried.
He was there, Tatum.
It's alright. I'll get it.
It was him, Tatum. I know it.
Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve.
I don't know, they just did.
Okay, but whatever you did -- the entire student body thanks you.
Tits -- see.
This can't be my last duty here.  It will go on and on.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
Can't you feel it yet?  Can't you feel that feeling... ?  You're not going to be a cop anymore.
He's not finished.
It would be too hard.
What?  What?
I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?
Her pretty head.
NO!
Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder.  You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.
All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
I realize that.
Have you found any plastic scrapings near the stove or sink?  Near the food?
You always have to find one singular thing to focus on.  There's always one thing, and it may be as small as a speck of dust, but you find it and focus... till it's an exhausted possibility.
This was one sadistic motherfucker.
What about them?
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
Well, his body was found Monday night, okay?  But, get this... the office was closed all day Monday.  Which means, as long as the gluttony killing was done before the weekend, our killer could've gotten in here on Friday.  He could've spent all day Saturday with Gould, and all day Sunday.
This is just to satisfy my curiosity.  I'm still leaving town Saturday.
We put her in a safe house.
Yeah.  Parts of them.  Anyway, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who sinned...
I know.
Bear with me.
No.
Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.
We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom.  It's like collecting diamonds on a desert island.  You keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.
Yes we do.  Here...
It was him.
I'm trying, alright?  Just tell me what we've got.
Looking around... I've got a bad feeling these murders are his life's work.
No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.
It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.
Wrong!  I sympathize completely, because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you... you become like John Doe.  It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it, because it takes so much work to love.  You just have to make sure you don't stop to think about the abuse, and the damage, because you'll risk being sad.  Keep ignoring.
No I'm not!  I'm talking about common, everyday life here.  If you let yourself worry about one thing, you'll worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. In this place, ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a matter of survival.
Listen to yourself.  You say, "the problem with people is they don't care, so I don't care about people."  But, you're already here.  You've been here a long time.  So, there's a part of you that knows, even if everything you say is true, none of it matters.
Kiss me on the lips.
What are you talking about?  What happened?
Don't do this... please...
I don't know...
Don't argue!...And stay close... Maybe they're rustlers...and maybe this dodderin' old idiot ain't so far wrong...
An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!
What, Ben?
Why don't you finish the job?
What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
I ain't wearing no gun.
Now, now...let's not grow dis- putatious...
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
<U>Captain</U>...Nope, wouldn't say that... Likely you had your reasons for killin' Futterman...Probably needed killin'...I'm speaking as a ranger now, not as a reverend...Fact that all three was shot in the back is the only thing that's raised some question -- that and a missin' gold piece known to have been on him just prior to his demise.
Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...
Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
Yesterday, one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with Scar till only two days ago... He talks crazy but I brought him along...Says he lives here...keeps mentioning a rocking chair.
But...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection...
We ain't goin'! We ain't goin' without you, Debbie...Ethan, get the horses...I'll try to keep her talkin'...
You lie! All white men lie...and kill...
These are my people...  Unnt-meah! Go! Go! <U>Please</U>!
Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...
You got it with you?
<U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?
Well...I know there were some captives recovered...
Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points.
How should <U>I</U> know...She's YOUR wife!
Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....
We won't be here...Come on!
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
I got your boy killed.
You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
I'm a woman, Martie...  We wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives...When you're little we even wash <U>you</U>....How a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman I'll never know...
Shush!...Time for bed anyway...  Likely these'll need some takin' in...Oh, Martie, you're that gaunted! ...Ma's havin' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and...
Come on, say it.  You know...
Well then, I guess I'd better leave the two of you alone.  But don't forget...
My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
Making our very own solstice fire.
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
Come on, this isn't about honesty. You just need a good night's sleep. The way you toss and turn all night, even I hardly get any sleep.
Oh, baloney.  You should just hear yourself talk!
...So he's dictating you a new bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's not our son.
What?
I had the Christopher Marlowe in my boat once.
It's for Henslowe. He paid me.
Ten pounds.
Done.
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
Interesting.
So now you are free to love
That's me.
Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake.
A share of the profits.
It is all locked safe in here
As soon as I have found my muse
Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?
Well, I am a dead man and buggered to boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful -
Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona.
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
How will it?
How goes it, Will?
Not new--my Doctor Faustus.
Yes, that's good. Until he meets
His best friend is killed in a duel by Ethel's brother or something. His name is Mercutio.
A different one you haven't written?
A comedy of quarreling families reconciled in the discovery of Romeo to be the very same Capulet cousin stolen from the cradle and fostered to manhood by his Montague mother that was robbed of her own child by the Pirate King!
You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig!
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty
They are not acted for you, they are acted for me.
There was a wager, I rememberas to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love. I think you lost it today.  You are an eager boy. Did you like the play?
Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts.  How much was the wager?
"Madam!"
Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?
But your voice  Have they dropped?
A lowly player.
Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart.
You can bring them with a word.
Well perhaps better than my first. 
There is time. It is still dark.
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
Oh, but it will end well for love?
I have spoken with your father.
So my lord? I speak with him every day.
Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.
I do not love you, my lord.
Lady Viola isyoung in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.
Oh!--dear God, I did not think it would be me to tell you. A great loss to playwriting, and to dancing.
No, sir.
Of course you have not! I have not written it!
And her voice? Like lark song?
I was a poet till now, but I have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the Tower.
Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry.
You're a bad loser.
I can't do it.
I'm just telling you I can't cut him up.
Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.
But not quite.
Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.
After.
How much?
I don't know.
Security.
Oh, that'll come in useful.
They can know all they like, it won't do them the slightest bit of good --
Not at all.
Parked outside?
Cameron?
She hated you --
-- which is --
A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
Yes.
Who was it?
Then let's spend some money.
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
It tastes different.
You know we're right.
And the money?
Alex.
Of course.
No, nothing, sorry.
I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
Yes.
What?
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
If I think you're lying --
I should hope so.
In this firm.
Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
Here?.
Oh, him. Well, he died.
You must be Juliet.
Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
No.
A little bit. Is that good or bad?
The human condition.
I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
Yes.
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
My keys.
Why not?
I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.
Your husband?
No.
Chopped liver?
Yeah.
Why?
Yeah...
Well, I do Barbara Rush.
Pardon me?
Buffums?
You promised you'd do the show.
And?
Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
I just have to do one little thing.
Did I what?
You did, didn't you?
One of my few virtues is discretion.
Yeah, baby...
What are you talking about?
-- this guy with Jill.
C'mon, cunt, you're going for a walk.
-- why not? C'mon, take me out of here, somewhere I don't have to lie to anybody and I'll fuck your brains out, you little fiend, I adore you --
You were great.
You don't think so? I do.
-- well, if you feel like playing, go play...
-- do you want ice?
Why?
I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.
-- Otis?
Hey, stop by the shop.
Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy I divorced last summer.
Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
Where?
Well, it's a big canyon.  Honey, I'm sorry but I've gotta get back... just for a minute.
Well, like what?
What?
I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm gonna open the shop. I'm getting it together.
Right now -- I'm at the epitome of my life. Right now I feel so good I'm afraid something's gonna happen.
Honey, what happened?
Do you really mean that?
Yeah, baby.
We live together now.
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
Great.
Hello.
How did it go at the bank?
Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
Honey, have they offered you the job?
I'll call you.
I'll call you.
Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
... Okay...
Ha, ha.
-- she's a very compulsive girl.
I didn't want him meeting me here.
Yes.
You told him I was here and he wanted to know if I was beating you up.
What did you say?
-- A wash and set.
No?
I'm better than the guy I work for.
Thank you.
I know it, I know it.
Oh, hey...
All night.
Well... who are those guys?
What do they look like?...
Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
I said sit down!
Then don't... just have 'em beat me up or whatever you're gonna do.
What, do you think I planned it?
Do you think Lorna hates her? I don't think she hates her. I mean she may resent her a little...
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
Well, I don't know.
Have a drink.
I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't.
No.
Come on by.
Then you were talking to him.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You know what's wrong.
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
I guess not.
It must be something.
We don't think marriage is important.
-- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
... Mmm-hmmm.
-- He reached up and tore them.
That's right.
Not with your hairdresser.
I don't think so.
-- oh I don't know --
You're going.
-- his car. They have it blocked.
Jill.
Thank you.
Well you should have eaten your breakfast.
Okay.
Yes.
Do you like this hotel?
French Fries and Ketchup.
Who says you ain't supposed to?
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
Try to think what it was.
What about Room 237?
Nothing.  There ain't nothing in Room 237, but you ain't got no business going in there anyway, so stay out!  You understand, stay out!
Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.
And you're gonna lose.  And I'm gonna get you - you betta run fast! Look out - I'm coming in close. All right?
I won't, Mom.
Danny... what's the matter, hon?
Danny, come here!
Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up, wake up Danny, wake up.'
Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
Yes sir.  Look um... I think the best thing is to come along to the gentlemen's room, sir, and eh...
Fine.
Yes, sir.
Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
Hallo.  My name's Dick Halloran. I'm the Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel.
Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?
This is Dick Halloran, our Head Chef.
Oh, that's just great.  How do you folks like our hotel so far?
Well one thing for sure, you don't have to worry about food because you folks could eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice.
Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
Yeah.  We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.  But how did you know that?
Pleased to meet you.
What line of work are you in now?
Well this ought to be quite a change for you.
Thank you for saying so.
Uh...huh.
I love it.  I really do.  I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
I dreamed that I... that I killed you and Danny.
You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
Go away.
Wendy...
Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.
can of itself be a problem.
Great...
I'm intrigued.
I don't suppose they eh told you anything in Denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970?
Well, my predecessor in this job
Royalty?
All the best people.
Oh, I'll say.
Jack is a schoolteacher.
I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
When me and sissy were kids, we were just like you two.
You're a real booger, you know it?
Okay. Have you got enough gas to get home, Marty?
Piss on him. Piss on all the Red Sox.
What if it's some kind of monster?
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
I don't get you.
What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
I saw what I saw.
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
I am sorry for all my sins.  And yours.
Look at that.  Get a gander.
Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in.  You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the warp.  Is that clear?
Just about.  Show me again.
No way.  We're a choir, right? Headliners.  The big room.  Two days a week won't cut it.  Every day.
It's a rhythm section.  The beat.
So use it.  When we sing hymns, they're usually about rejoicing, right? Celebration.  Most music is.  So don't hold back.  Let all that joy go right into your voice.  Make me happy.  Let me hear it.  Perk out.  Perk down.
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
What a shame!
Were you wicked?
Enough jabber.
You re okay -- for a civilian.
Five a.m.?
She said that?  Reverend Mother?
We must... get you some experience.  We must... leave this place.
Right.
This is your neighborhood.  Your turf. You should get to know 'em.
Right to Hell.  Just kidding. Where is that bus?
I WAS HELL-BOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING
What is your full name?  Your Christian name?
Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.
What? 
Your cigarette -- out.
Check your driver's license.
Of course.  But it's almost lunch.
Would you like that?
Like to who?
Right.  So what do we do now?  Ping- Pong?  Row over to the monastery?
I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
But you can't kick me out!  Guys want to kill me!  You're a nun!  A big nun! Aren't you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep?  I mean, I'm a major sinner!  All-time great!  Hall of Fame!  Aren't I, like, your dream come true?  Your Olympic event?
You're my Olympic event.
Please let me try.  I'm begging you.
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
The majority has spoken.
I must go where I can be of use.
Okay, so I just got things started.  But you could build on that.  You could keep it going.
You saved my life.
Really?  And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other.
It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
But Vince has contacts all over the place!  This is San Francisco!  They'll be looking for me!
Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
Really?  Lieutenant?
You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes are shining.  You're rea1ly different...
You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
We didn't tell you what?
I'm telling you!
Which one!
Neither did you!
We're losing it.
Which convent was that, Sister?
That was exciting!
It's better than springtime.
It's no use.  She just isn't here.
Yes?
Are you nuts?  She's not a nun.  It's Christy.  She's a babe!
Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town.  What about breakfast, woman?  Or, am I to starve to death?
You need to sleep.
Wallowing in sin and lust...
Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.
I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...
How could he?
You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
Man or woman?
All I saw was their lantern.
What does it mean?
It might have been more.  Might have been positively grand talk.
The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once.
Are you so superstitious?
There is no such thing as magic.
You are funny.
The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
I apologize if I worried you.
I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
Call me a liar, then, and a murderess. Say it, out and out.
His horse.
Yes, actually.
Yes... yes.  I think I will...
Yes.  Here...
You want to see into the nether world... I can show you.  Whatever you see, do not move or speak.  I will hold him.
Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe you did tell me that one before. I've heard that a bunch. Long time ago.
Now it's minimal wage and there ain't nothin' but a army cot and a toilet back there.
I'll let you off while it's still daylight.
He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid.
Okay, stop back by. Don't worry about your boy here, he's doin' good.
What you got that's good to eat?
I got a mama, but she's at work over at Ben's Dollar Store. My daddy's dead.  He got hit by a train.
How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
Karl's my name.
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.
Frank, why don't you go off and play in your room if Doyle's gonna talk nasty.
Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.
You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.
What do you want, hun?
Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I?  Was I?
That ain't none of your damn bidness. Besides that's the way friends do one another. Fuck it, I'm gonna go call 'em. Honey, find my guitar, I think it's out there in the garage with that loony tune.
I hate you!
I'll kill you, you fuckin' faggot! You mind your own business. Now get out! Now, before I get too mad to turn back.
Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
Childers.
But maybe just for awhile --
I'm closing the door now. I told you, I'll see you later.
Yeah.
You told me to come by.
Naw. Didn't have too much. Enough to scrape by on, I reckon.
He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.
You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.
It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.
All right then.
Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they?
If you want me to.
I bet he will. I got a little money if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye.
That's real good. You ort not to if ye ain't married to somebody. Bible tells you that much. Hit tells some things that don't seem right too, I reckon. I guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though.  You don't touch yourself, do you?
You ort not to pull on yourself that away.
'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin' it. When you run real fast tryin' to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else. I ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any brothers and sisters growin' up to play with?
Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with.
I didn't feel right about doin' that. I takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more proper to me, I reckon.
I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.
I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do.
I'm tired, too, Frank.  If I ain't around no more, it don't mean I don't care fer ye. I care for ye a good deal. I care for you more than anybody they is. We made friends right off the bat.
Yes sir.
Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all. There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop.  He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
I know he does.
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
I stay on my feet all the time at work. I just can't find shoes that's comfortable.
Yes, I guess you are.
I want to come back and stay here.
Well, you can't do that. You're a free man. You've been let out to do as you please.
I reckon I can just walk around till the mornin'. Or set and read me a book somewhere.
Yes sir.
My history.
Where'd he go? What's goin' on?
He wanted to go off and play, I reckon.  You go in there and you and that Doyle eat ye dinner. You don't have to worry yourself none.
Yeah.
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.
You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.
They turned me loose from the state hospital.
I've heard it said that way.
Anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. I've wanted to leave many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. Anyway, I'm rambling. If you're going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. Doyle is a monster. Not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. A dangerous person. I've told Linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I see it in his eyes. I'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle will make your life hell. You're a perfect target. When I first saw you I was afraid of you. Not really afraid, I guess, just taken aback. But also, I felt a real sensitive feeling from you. And for some reason, Frank has adopted you. Much like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. In a good way. Anyway, I just want you to know what you're in for. I have a good feeling about you. You're good for Frank. Maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a bad way.  There's one more thing. It's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. Everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something -- terrible. But what I see before me is a gentle, simple man. All I want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around Linda and Frank. You know. You would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?
Vaughan, don't get pushy.
In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?
The other thing is I told your boss on the phone to send a man. Karl won't talk to women.
Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.
And what are you, his chaperone?
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
I'll tell you all about it...  ... but not here.
Not Elizabeth the Second, Elizabeth the First.  Did you ever hear of Sir Walter Raleigh?
I wouldn't think of it.  See you around, fellas.
I didn't know you took pictures.
A photographer ...
That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.
It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.
Hi, Auggie.
Yeah, probably.
I lied to her, and then I stole from her. I don't see how you can call that a good deed.
Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now.  Was that your idea to call her Felicity?
You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.
You're a cold-hearted bastard, aren't you? How'd you ever get so mean, Auggie?
Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you to do a little favor like that. Besides, you might even learn something.
She looks just like you.
You told me you wanted to meet him. Well,here he is.
She's just a kid. There's time for more babies later. After she grows up.
Five thousand bucks.
Shit. You should have been married to someone by now. You know, settled down somewhere with a kid or two, a nice steady job.
They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
Okay, my man. Love to the wife and kids, et cetera, et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you can remember the address.
This way, gentlemen. Let's retire to my office, shall we?
What do you care where it comes from? It's yours.
What difference does it make?
And how much are these?
Thanks for the tip.
You mean Rashid?
He doesn't go to the Trinity School?
And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, "I don't have a father. As far as I'm concerned, that son-of-a-bitch is dead."
You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
I don't know what you look like, boy. As far as I can tell, you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night.  You live in this town -- or on your way from here to there?
Just passing through.
It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.
Son-of-a-bitch. You're some piece of work, aren't you?
Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, I'm going straight down the skids. What do I want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay my own wages.
It was just a thought.
You know, health insurance, dental plan, paid vacation. It's not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up for their rights.
An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."
Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?
Well what?
Aren't you going to say anything?
I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.
You still have that watch Auggie gave you?
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
It's okay, mister. No big deal.
I don't drink coffee.  On the other hand, since you insist, if you offered me a cold lemonade. I wouldn't say no.
Just one bottle. I believe in moderation.
In Manhattan?
Of course. Where else?
Except that there's no bed, is there? And no breakfast either.
People don't do that kind of thing. Not in New York.
This is the first house I've been in without a TV.
Eight-thirty?
It just won't do, will it? I go two and a half years without being able to write a word, and then, when I finally get started on something, when it looks as though I might actually be coming to life again, you show up and start breaking everything in my house. It just won't do, will it?
Appreciation for what?
I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood.  To make sure I don't run into him again.
The man has friends. And they're not likely to forgive me if I testify against him.
It might not be far, but it's another galaxy. Black is black and white is white, and never the twain shall meet.
It looks like they've met in this apartment.
Let's not get too idealistic.
Come on, just a little hint.
Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are open, you might as well take advantage of me.
His only copy?
If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
The water was dripping, see... I turned it off, but it was still dripping, and then Auggie had to go out, and so I left the back room ... And later on ... well, later on ... when Auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded. His Cuban cigars got all messed up ... You know, soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits....
He was out five thousand bucks, he said.... He kept saying it over and over.... Five thousand bucks down the drain.... He wouldn't stop.... Five thousand bucks, five thousand bucks.... He was like out of his mind with those five thousand bucks....
Good. I'm glad that's settled!
Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?
Everything is real in here, honey.  As real as the color of my hair.
You want another one of these, too?
Keep it tonight.  We'll catch fish. I'll see ya back on the docks...
You don't.
Now, how is Miyamoto gonna know in <u>advance</u>?  That Carl loses two batteries.  Must happen once ever' 20 years or so.
So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news.  Yes?
I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
More than eager.  He was out to make a point.
But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
He didn't want to lose any more.
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
Well.  It shows the prosecutor was wrong.  It was <u>Carl's</u> boat that was dead in the water.  Or he'd never have put up the lantern.
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
It's a rare thing.  Takes a turning point.
I was checking the cables.
Apparently.
I don't think so.
The damage was considerable. But she's insured.  Thanks, again.
What else could it be?
<u>You</u> said that.  That was <u>your</u> testimony.
Is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was.
I wouldn't say encouraged.
Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed.
Whatever the latest jargon is.                                   MEKUM Much better, much higher.  For example, where your old ones expressed ninety percent of their sexual energy in aggressive physicality, these new ones are ninety-nine percent without sexual inclination.  It's <u>all</u> aggression.                                   SLOAN                          <u>Real</u> men!                                   CHURCH                          At ease, Lieutenant.                          What if they fought?     A sudden silence.     SLOAN raises her eyebrows, gives RUBRICK a look.     Frowning thoughtfully, MEKUM looks up. MEKUM You mean up there?                                   CHURCH                                             Go ahead, Rube.  Tell Todd to take him. MEKUM No!     They all look at MEKUM.  Is this the chink in the armor?  The new soldiers can't fight?                                   CHURCH                    "No"? MEKUM Not fair.  No contest.  Send two more of your old ones up.     Now CHURCH, RUBRICK, and SLOAN are stunned.  They exchange a glance.                                   MEKUM Go ahead.
That's the way I like 'em - big and sassy.  And get rid of your roommate.
Clarinet - drums - trumpet - trombone -
Now cut that out, girls-none of that rough talk.  They went to a conservatory.
Stop, or I'll burst out crying.
Like I was telling you - Little Bonaparte is getting soft.  He doesn't have it here any more.  Used to be like a rock.  Too bad.  I think it's time for him to retire.
I told you - it's a sure thing.
But, Joe - three weeks in Florida!  We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.
With those legs?  Are you crazy?
I never did like the name Geraldine.
When I was a kid, I used to have a dream - I was locked up in this pastry shop overnight - with all kinds of goodies around - jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts -
You'd better go fix it.
But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
Good night, Josephine.
It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.
You wouldn't hit a girl, would you?
I'm tired of being a flag.  I want to be a bull again.  Lets get out of here, Joe. Let's blow.
What's the beef?  We're sitting pretty. We get room and board - we get paid every week - there's the palm trees and the flying fish -
You can both go take a flying jump.
I'm just borrowing them.  You'll get them back tomorrow.
I'm engaged.
Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?
Jerry, listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it's just not being done!
But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
We'll walk.  And if we have to, we'll starve.
There you go with that we again.
Yeah, but they're not watching yachts. Come on - you're going to call Osgood.
If it hadn't been for you, they would have kicked me off the train.  I'd be out there in the middle of nowhere, sitting on my ukulele.
It must be freezing outside.  When I think of you - and your poor ukulele -
Sssh.  Sweet Sue.
I'm not crowding you, am I?
What did you say?
No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
When?
You're so flat-chested.  Clothes hang so much better on you than they do on me.
If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him.  Wait till I tell Josephine.
Neither can I.  Come on - lets go up to her room and tell her - right now.
Yes.  He wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he's going to pick me up at the pier.
Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones -
Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?
Yes.  For a whole year.
- you got to be blonde -
- and you got to be girls.
What's with him - he drinks?
I am Osgood Fielding the Third.
You don't say.
You're not sure?
You know something, Mr. Fielding? You're dynamite!
Yes, Osgood?
Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.
Why not?
Well - nobody's perfect.
Just the two of you?  What about the crew?
We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -  Come on, Jerry.
Oh, it's you!  You got a lot of nerve -
Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
My car?  Why, you -
We'll take it!
You got it.  It's six dollars a man.  Be on the campus in Urbana at eight o'clock -
No - funerals.
Would you mind rejoining the living? Goose it up a little.
All the girls drink - but I'm the one that gets caught.  That's the story of my life. I always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
Have you ever been with a male band?
That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years.  Oh, brother!
I'll say.
You can't trust those guys.
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
You know - I play tenor sax.
You are?
Thank you.
No, my flag steward.
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
- Inauguration balls -
I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play.
If it's at all possible -
Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute - collects shells.
Oh, Josephine - just imagine - me, Sugar Kowalczyk, from Sandusky, Ohio, on a millionaire's yacht.  If my mother could only see me now -
It's not how long you wait - it's who you're waiting for.
I wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of Long Island is fogged in.
My dad is more interested in railroads. Baltimore and Ohio.  Which is the port and which is the starboard?
Yes - now let's see - where do you suppose the steward set it up?
You're flattering me.
Oh, it's not your fault.  It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.  Something goes wrong inside.
What happened?
Is it that hopeless?
It's like smoking without inhaling.
Thank you.
Where did you learn to kiss like that?
Good morning.
But you have.  You've given me all that inside information - first thing tomorrow I'm going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of Venezuelan oil.
You'll forget him, Sugar.
That's right - pour it on.  Talk me out of it.
Show the gentleman to the chapel - pew number three.
Booze.
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
Come on, Spats - we know you own this joint.  Mozarella is just fronting for you.
Toothpick Charlie?  Never heard of him.
Why?
I sleep with my spats on.
I come to Grandma's funeral.  Here's your admission card.
Why wouldn't I?
What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
Oh, I wouldn't say that.  You were nice enough to recommend my mortuary to some of your friends...
No, Spats - no, no, no -  NO!
Bacardi 151.
Sure, disappear. Weve been walking away our whole lives.
And she wonders why I swim to the bottom of a Lemondrop every time I see her.
Sir, yes, sir!
Other than, hes shagging your exgirlfriend?
No.
Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
Doesnt look like nothing.
Exactly. I want us to look like we fit, but not like were trying too hard to look like we fit.  Its welcome cocktails, not prom. With this level of matchy-matchy, we should be drinking peach schnapps under a bleacher somewhere.
Youre funny.
Yeah, but I feel like crap. And if you feel like crap, its way better to look hot while youre doing it.
I dont know.
That wont be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  No offense.
Its okay. Hell, Ive never paid for it. But please dont feel like you have to explain yourself to me.
I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
When youre ready to let go, to be unsingle and unmiserable, you will. Until then....
My sixth-grade science project was entitled, Love Hurts: The Heartbreak of Human Papillomavirus. Trust me, Im careful.
I disappear. Its not about me.
Sure, but its never easy. They say theyre okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, theyre not.
Im so sorry.
Oh, well, then. It probably wont work out.
Will do.
I don't know, he's in a prison camp.
I don't live far from here. You and your dog can come home with me and have yourself a hot meal and then we'll talk about how to get you back home.
I try...
Dr. William E. B. Dubois. 
I have a mother and her name is Rebecca -- My father's name is Nathan Lee Morgan, and...
It was the best thing I ever been to, Miss Johnson!
Nothin'...
Go on...
Me and my little sister, went down to the water hole, last Saturday--
Yes mam...
Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--
Now look, Rita, I don't make the rules -- you puttin' yourself on a limb, comin' here, askin' me to do a thing like this. And I be damn if I'm going to jeopardize my job because you are in love with a little colored boy!
No buts, Rita!
You had a rough time out there tonight -- so you stay home from that school tomorrow.
He'll show up one day.
Just do like I tell you -- I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.
That musta been afta they sent me to this place call Clayburn. That was the hardest workin' camp they sent me to. The work was so hard, you had to look for somethin' to laugh about to keep from feelin' the whole pain in your body. Like one time, it was in the middle of the day, and there weren't no sun -- you hear that?
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
Will you help me to find out what camp they sent my father to?
Where all meat come from -- now git yourself washed up and be snappy about it -- you got six miles ahead of you to that school.
Yes mam...
Same as we -- they pray.
Children, come here...
No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.
No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
But who's gonna help me here with the house and in the field?
It's the heat.
Hi, Mrs. Boatwright...  I'm sorry 'bout the way I acted the other day, Miss Boatwright.
Maybe soon--
Is he gon' be gone long?
Hope it don't freeze out our baseball game today!
Yeah. I feel real up to it right now. Come on, David Lee, you and me'll do the loading.
To the commissary to get this boy some clothes! I'm gon' get everybody somethin'!
That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.
I got to see my husband, Sheriff Young!
Behold my glory.
What... are you?
Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me.
There are more important matters right now...
YOU JUST DON'T CARE!
BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
My head hurts.
Good. Now 'Pillow'.
How would you like to go to the principal's office?
What? Fuck you guys, I wanna get out of here.
How the fuck should I know!!
Okay.
I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME! I'M NOT LOU FERIGNO FOR PETE'S SAKE!
'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.
No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him!
Dude, they cut out 92 minutes!
What?
More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
Sure, dude.  On the face of every child, on the smile of every baby...
What Cartman?!
If you went down on a horse... You'd tell me, right?
Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.
Eric, you're not watching your mouth!
I am not a prickfuck, mkay? You little asshole!
The rest of you are graduated. You can go home today.
No, Eric... I'm afraid it's phase two for you...
A hunger strike? For what?
Children, I know ALL there is to know about women.
What?
Uhh...
Mph rmph rm rmph rm.
I wouldn't bullshit you kid! Snacky Smores are now available in stores everywhere! No biggie!
Dude, what the hell is going on?
You boys need help.  There are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language.
KYLE BROVLOFSKI, YOU WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!!
Uhh... I don't know.
Sheet.  Did you bring ze mirror?
Kay.
Oh... Alright, back you go.
Where do they come up with this stuff?!
Aw, God Damn it, he's singing that fucking song again.
I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
YOU BASTARD!!
What's the difference?
Yeah, they suck.
He was killed doing something he saw in the movie. It was Terrance and Phillip... THEY killed Kenny.
Huh?
Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
This is NOT a place for fun and games! This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!! We at MAC have a trial to go to!
<b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-</b>
This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  You are a bad man!
Don't believe the hype!!
I know, Terrance.  This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time.
No! It can't be!
Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
You don't get it Stan... You just don't get it.
Really? Where the hell do you keep it? It's huge.
What do you think this is kid?  Lick Barney the Dinosaur's pussy fucking kiddie hour?  Huh?  This is real life with consequences you take to the grave!
Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -
It certainly is.
Oh he did, did he?
Well you did the right thing Mac.
My...wings...
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
Well, maybe I will.  You sure you don't want anything?
That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
You better start making sense!
Who said I'll re-enter in the pod? I got friends out in space, Ryan, friends willing to get me back unnoticed.  Thank God for deregulation huh?
We have the codes here.  How do you want to receive them?
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
Fat chance of that.  Even if we had C4 and a laser torch these doors wouldn't budge.  That son of a bitch...that stupid son of a bitch.
Just considering our options... sir.
Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.
Simulated space walking.
I'll do my best.
We don't have time.  I'll explain later, hurry!
It did.  It is.  There's nothing we can do about that.
It would matter to us.
Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.
The engines!
Certainly.  I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.
That's affirmative.
No. I'm from Akron.
He's my dad.
I should've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one.
No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.
Think he bought it?
Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
brainstorm, Buzz. I admit, I thought it was a rotten idea, but I put up the scratch.  And now we got a beautiful thing.
It's a beautiful thing.
Miles, I've always been on the square with you.
I know your face, you're an up-and-comer. You bowl on the tour.
They suspended me for 100 years.
I ain't nobody's father!
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
I'm your blood.
You got a better offer?
That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split.
What about bowling?
You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call.  Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn.  Don't say I never gave you nothing.
You see what you did?  Take your ball and get out.
Hey man, welcome to our parking lot. Lemme give you some advice, if she asks you to dance, make sure her brother's not around. Somebody blew out Junior's pilot light, if you get my meaning.
Uh...over easy.
That's right, didn't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament,champ?  Now go take out your "big four", darling.  Come on, we're making her nervous.
How Mr. Kastle?
Why would you help me?
I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.
He killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he's gonna kill you next! Sid and Breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's MURMUR increases. Kastle turns and yells over his shoulder.
How do you want it?  The eggs.
Isn't this technically a scooter?
When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person.  Better than any sex I've ever had.
He follows me, he tries to have sex with me, and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me, he tries to have sex with me, they send him to the nut-hut for a while...
It's a vicious cycle.
The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.
I'd rather you didn't.
I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.
Why should I help that old fuck.
Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.
We would have sooner or later.
You don't get two chances with Junior.
I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.
What about plan C?
Fuck plan C!
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
Basement bingo?
Basic English?  There's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet.
I said back away.
How long will that be?
Nobody move!
Do you see it?
Pull it, damn it!
Press?  No, I haven't.
A thousand?  An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- I don't want to sound pessimistic here, but I assume there are no survivors.
Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --
Maybe older --
-- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.
What?
If it is alien, maybe we shouldn't try to open it at all.
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.
I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
How drastic?
At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.
What am I -- a dog, now?
... it raises a very serious question: <u>What happens if Jerry</u> <u>gets mad</u>?
No.  I think we should shut down the communication lines inside the habitat.  He might be listening now.
Jerry?
Harry?  Can you copy?
Yes, Harry.
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
Who is that?  Where's that coming from?
We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it?
He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge.
If the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic.
Nobody goes inside, until we know <u>what's</u> inside.
Considered what?  That it's American? How would you think it's American?
Maybe we didn't want to come back.
Give him a chance.  He's speaking our language, not the other way around.
What?
Too big?
C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.
Yeah.  Drowning.
No, thank you.  I hate jellyfish.
Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived.  Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  Then jellyfish?
What are they?
In Edmunds' things.
He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.
You told him about me?
Beth, I didn't.  Hold it together. Alright?
I have to reset the sub.
You, me and Harry?
But I don't know how --
Still clear.
We must've had it delivered then.
I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
What?
How can the sphere do that?
Which I told Barnes was attacking --
Sintag.
I'll just boost the doses.
How fast does it take effect?
Look, it's either him or us, Norman. Another attack, and we go down with this place.
In the sub.  Resetting the timer. Why?
Your watch.
Am I afraid of them?  Not during the day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch.  This is quite good.
But --
That's when you went in the sphere.
Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman.
You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  That's right.  But you can't remember going inside, can you?  No, of course not.  Harry couldn't either, could he?  "Like everything's on the tip of my tongue", he said.
That's bullshit.
Shut up, Beth --
Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!
You think I care?  You think I care if I die?  Would I put explosives around the habitat -- set on vibration sensors -- that can trigger automatically, if I cared about myself?  Would I? I've tried twice before, Norman, why wouldn't I try a third time?  I'm not thinking about myself -- No, Norman, I'm thinking about you.  Your safety. Protecting you from your own self.
You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?
Leave me alone, Norman.
C'mon --
No I'm not.  I'm not star--
We can refuse to talk.
Won't make any difference.  The tapes document everything.
You sound defensive.
I don't follow you.
Gimme another explanation.
What noise?
That far in what, Harry?
You don't remember that?
Wisconsin?
Hold on.
I heard!  I heard!
Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
What is it, Harry?
A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  Someone went to a lot of trouble.  Try again.
Is it?
It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.
The others, sir?
They're in the sub, sir.  Waiting.
You've heard of me?
Huh?
What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash?
Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.
I don't see anything.
Not that I know of.  Why?
I'm not sure.
Of course he did.  He's been isloated for 400 years.  He wants someone to talk to.  Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic.  We're talking about 400 years here.  An alien that shows emotional responses.  I think we need to address him, before he reacts further.
Four.  Four years --
How are you getting to the airport? You need money for the bus?
What?
Was it a military crash?
They never used to send a Navy car.
I'm beginning not to like you.
Fear is their greatest weapon.
Is that good or bad?
Oh, so you're a warrior then?
Of course.  I'm a Bendu officer.
What do you mean?
How can you store an energy field within you?
He's bluffing...
These are doubtful times.  The Empire has grown bold in its disregard of the...
I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.
What's that?
Yes, sir, but I can get him...
Send one squad up.
What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
We have a little business to take care of first, but it shouldn't take long. We'll be back shortly.
Why didn't you say so before.
Move out of the way!
They'll find its weakness.
He'll be well cared for.
If you're as good a pilot as you are a swordsman... We're the ones who have been rewarded.
I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.
You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here...
I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.
Good.  We're right above you.  Stand by.
Hey, don't laugh. Everyone oughta have a friend like me !
It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...!
Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
Yes, sir !
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
I don't know. It's my last night as acivilian. I ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.
Zander, please... Let's go !
If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?
Funny...
You're upset, that's alright.
That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
Your turn...
Who ?
Carl can wait.
Yeah, sure, I guess.
You're right. Let's never stop...
I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will.
Johnny... Life is so different from the way it was. One day you'll see what I did was best for both of us.
Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.
What happened to your eye ?
How are you, Carl ?
Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.
Thank you, ma'am.
Ibanez...LET'S GO !
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
You're the best.
You saying you didn't ?
What's that, Diz ?
It's alright 'cause I got to have you, Johnny...
AAAAAAAAAAA !
I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform.
Hi, mom.
Saddle up, boys, that's our trash !
Let's get some armor on her, and the we'll get outa this stinkin bug hole !
Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
Is V'ger the Captain of the alien vessel?
That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise.
They have repressed the Creator.
Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement.
Very well, Mr. Chekov, see to it. Viewer off.
They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
Yes.
Program set for standard Warp entry, Captain...
Yes, sir, I'll do that.
Mr Decker....
That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.
I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.  But it's the only game in town.
And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this...  ... point here, Captain. It should pick up even a tricorder playback.
That would presuppose a feeling, Commander... compassion. I sensed <U>no</U> emotion, only...  ... pure logic.
This served the purpose.
It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.
Unidentified small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us, Captain! Directly ahead...!
Aye, sir.
Sit down, please.
That inquiry invades my personal life, Captain.
But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack.
Exact patterns. The energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them, stored them. But why?
'Is this all I am? Is there not more?'
The point is, Captain, <U>twenty-two</U>    
Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
To you, sir?
I intend to be there following that meeting. Report to me. One hour!
That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!
He'll eat potroast and like it.
Well, it had sentimental value.
"Anguish."
It's...
First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642.
Yes.
Yes...
Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
And you're the only one who'll ever hear that speech.  Just you.
I live there.
Really.  With the porch swing and everything...
I love your script.
How can you <u>say</u> that?
You bet your life.  "The mill wheel goes around...some times it's even under water -- then it rises up, as high as it can go..."
...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very important.
That's for sure.
What are you doing down there?
Better'n new, cause it's got a <u>story</u>. Want to do the other part?
"Room Service!"
I don't drink.
Oh.
How about, he sees her on the street, he wipes the soot from his eyes.  He goes up to her.  "What happened to the horse?" She looks at him.  She takes his hand...
I hurt you?
She <u>realizes</u> -- it was not the fire which <u>hurt</u> him...that the <u>true</u> hurt was her. Was her...
...what...?
It does?
Well ain't you amazing.
...you think that's right...
Water or mineral deposits.
After Drama Group.
That's so beautiful...
Where have you been...
Well, I <u>know</u>, because they <u>told</u> me you were with that writer from the, you see, this is what I mean, the whole <u>town</u> has been warped by the, by, by the presence of the movie company, they holler, and we jump, you have a <u>date</u>, they call, you're doing business nine o'clock at night.  It isn't...
He works on the movie.
That a fact.  Now, is it a good play?
Hi.
Can't...can't you build the Old Mill?
It's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise.
They know what her tits look like.
Whatever it is.  GO <u>do</u> it.  How you doing on the permit?
I will.
What is that in fingers...?  Just kidding, get me this horse.
Tell the guy, get me the horse, I'll give him an Associate Producer credit.
You know who the <u>father</u> is...?
They think it's your First Wife...
She wasn't in the...
...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...
I never touched her.  My mother's gr...
Bourbon and Milk.
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
Bob, Bob, stick to the business, will you?
And you go start with <u>that</u> stuff in <u>this</u> town...
Scene <u>twelve</u>...arrival at the mill.
There's other things to be learned.
The Mayor's outside.
Who is it raped you?
We know that you weren't.
<u>You</u> know...Where's your bathroom?
Will you help me out...?
...we had a script conference...
I just...
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
And you know what...?
The minute I read that script I said...
He treated me as if I were a child...
Well, Joe said it, and he's right.
Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?
Doug...
You've got nothing, you don't have a witness...
He didn't have to tell...
I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.
Mmmm.  You have children?
He should be put in jail.
Half a buck I'd put him in jail...
You should.
He saw the girl in the car...
You bet he did.
You go in her room, take the lilacs from the water, dry them.  Go buy some cellophane, wrap em up, and get a card from <u>Marty</u>.  What's her problem?
Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up...
I...
You built an Old Mill in New Hampshire...
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
I know you do.
...she keeps her back to the camera...?
To the contrary.  I want you to tell the truth.  The truth is, you can't tell me, to a certainty, that you saw the thing.  You don't remember, a gun to your head, which glasses you have on.  And you have a fertile imagination.  Imagination wants to fill in the blanks.  Now.  If you aren't <u>sure</u>, then they have nothing.  Bob walks free.  As he should.  Joe:  wasn't long ago they buried actors at the crossroads with a stake through their heart.  You know?  The people who are talking to you about the way we live though we may praise them, we fear them. And they fear us.  Because we tell the truth.  About our lives.  Now, this is a damn roust, and everyone knows it; the guy is looking for a case, he wants to make a name for himself.  If we let him do that, if we let him do that, then we're being false to our community...to our community, you understand...?  To our world.  Cause you are a part of that world, now.  You have to take off the Steel Rolex and put on the Gold Rolex.  And be part of your world.  I got a five picture deal with the studio.  And you stick with me.  You write one, two more, you stick with me, and you'll <u>direct</u> the third one.  You are a part of this world. It's in your blood.  It's you.  You have to do the right thing:  we're out in the Provinces, the Sheriff, <u>literally</u> is at our door.  You have to stand with the troops, Joe.  That's the bottom line. You <u>have</u> to...if you had the leisure to think it through, you'd see it for yourself.  The girl wasn't in the car.
I can write it.  I can't type it.
What did you say to them...?
How do you know you saw it?
That's thoughtful.  Ziz good, you try this?
Did you bring Bob's weights?
I'm gonna' bring it off.
How are you getting on with these fine people?
That's why I <u>want</u> it.  Type it up and get it back to me in...
I don't got the money.
NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF.  DID YOU HEAR ME?
Gimme Howie Gold.  Howie?  Thizz...I neee...I NEED EIGHT HUNDRED GRAND.  I...I don't care where it comes from...  It comes out of our end.  I...I need...JUST GET ME THE MONEY. I...JUST GET ME THE GODDAMN MONEY...Look:
You tell me what to do, I'll do it.
And we're glad to have you here...
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
Bet you did.
I NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie!
I don't <u>want</u> to be Lady Godiva anymore, no matter <u>how</u> much I like chocolate.  I want to be a stud.
I live.  In the same country.
Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual...
But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
Like a big sister.
I could help with the debate.
Great.
...they all yell 'There goes the Virgin Queen' or the 'Ice Princess', or some <u>really</u> clever cut like that. Like it hurts my feelings.
I'm not.
You lost Ben?!
Of course not.  Does he look lost to you?  BENNNNN!!!
Great.  Big ears, too?
There's worse things.
Thank you Ben.  That was so sweet of you.  Goodnight Annabelle.  Sweet dreams.
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
I think she's pretty, Mommy.
Yes...if you like big hair...
Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.
Thursday's fine...
Is your bad?
Where Ben?
Heaven.  I have to tell him he's made a mistake.  He should take Grammy Martha first.  Or Grandpa Norman.
Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.
Have you still never told him?
Duncan.  My work is everything to me. This'll never happen again.  Now stand back -- this session's gonna make you remember why you hired me even though I wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper let's get these penguins dancing --
They're losing one mother.  They can't lose two.
Remarried.  There is no move.
Not to me.
Don't do this.
Partly.  But partly, you're mad.
Never stand between that kid and a meatball.
Maybe the problem is your <u>kids</u>.  Maybe they're spoiled, coddled <u>brats</u>!
But it's not on the schedule!
I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration.  I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...
I'm sorry.  Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but...
What?  And have Federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders? How many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors?
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
Fine, forget it.
Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
Yes?
When I twisted hair like this it means I'm intimidated by you...
I was looking for Annabelle's book, and I found your tickets.  And the note.  From your new boss.
We can't live like that.
You're not dying.
You're a cross-dresser.
...going out, yeh.  I had kids of my own, once.
Right.  Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.
And you said...
It's the same choice you made.
Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
And her...?
Give 'em my number.
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
Right down to the ground.  Let's get to it.
You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
So you became the hero.  And I became the schmuck.
Come on, a wuss like me?  The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?
What do I have that you don't?
Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.
No you don't.  And I'm not gonna screw with my kids heads right now --
Uh.  Annabelle's video report has been switched again.
I know that.
...while she watched the kids.  Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...
Because you've changed so much.
Something came up.  C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...
Nice to have you here.
I did not go to high school.
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
My baby.
He wasn't.
I am sure.
I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.
No, you don't.
You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
What's an audience going to tell you?
I'm serious! What happens if he blows up the school?
What?
He's right.
How was the class?
Look, Vi, I don't blame you. You feel You feel pity now. The pleasure isn't there any more. The kinkiness has gone...You've become kind.
You know he hated my story also.
Gee, you're home early!
Thank you.  So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
Nigger.
OK.
That's what I was gonna ask you.
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
Can I see what you have so far?
Thanks man.
Yeah and we don't have much ammo either!
I wasn't angry with you I was angry with him.
They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?
You're talking about committing suicide!
I don't know.  If you gave me a reason to...
You're going to pay for this...
Like where--in your dreams?
I don't want any...
I said I don't want any, goddammit!
Chemco's been developing nerve gas?
She's as good as gone...
I don't think you--grasp--the situation, Mr. Myers.
Is there anything in there that can blow?  We have to be ready for any contingency--
I know what I'm here for-you don't need to remind me.
Excellent.
Good.
Agreed--let's move it.
We can't--it's power driven!
They must have got their hands on a test vial!
What does that mean?
All right, Mister Ambassador!  But you must treat General "Buck" Schmuck with the respect due him.
Now, Mister Ambassador.  In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone.  I intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.
Did you get that, Kulnick?
That's preposterous!  We have no such program!
That's nonsense, and you know it!
And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.
Oh, yes, that's right.
I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.
What do you think of this, Mister President?  I told you we shouldn't let him in here.
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
On your feet, fella.  I've got to get outside and see how my men are.
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz...P...I...E... T...R...A...S...Z...K...I...E...W... I...C...Z.
Now look here, Miss Pietraszkiewicz, this is Air Command Headquarters calling.
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
I want him upped to Brigadier General, and recomended for the D.S.C.
Yes, sir.
Condition Red!
Major, that's all I've been told.  Just got it on the red phone.  The base is to be sealed tight.  And I mean tight.
No calls at all.  With or without my say-so. My voice can be imitated too, Major.
And lastly, all privately owned radios are to be immediately impounded.  They can be used to issue instructions to saboteurs. Air Police will have lists of all owners.
That's a good question, Major.  Maybe if you think hard, you can think of the answer yourself.
Well, I think I remember reading the report on that.  Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?
Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?
Where, sir?
Well, sir, like I said, for the same reasons we do.  I mean, all the experts say the most likely way for War to start nowadays is by an accident, or a mistake, or by some mentally unbalanced person -- 
Major, you're talking like one of them!
And you'd like to see that?
Major, I hate to say this, but I think you've been enemy indoctrinated, and you don't even know it.
I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.
Well, what about the Positive Control, the safety catch?  Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?
Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.
Mister President, I know you think I've let you down, but we had to have a Plan-R.  If we completely centralized the command and control, all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the Capitol, and we'd be out of business. We'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered.
Hello, are you still there?...Uh-huh...I'll be right back.  We're still working this thing out.
Well, just common sense, sir.  Thirty from thirty-four equals four, or my name's not "Buck" Schmuck!
Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
What?
We'll worry about that later.  Okay, I'll take damage reports.
Look, I'm shot - it hurts.
Sure, I'll take her up to eight hundred.
I just got another blast on the CRM-114, and the damned thing decodes: Wing Attack, Plan-R.
Skip it and jump, damn you!  This flak's so close, I can smell it.
Sure!  Sure, I'm on my way.
Like hell it does.
Come on, King.  That doesn't make sense.
I'm okay.  What's up?
There's no other way, boys.  I'm going to have to take her in...the hard way.
I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
Can I have some?
Intense.
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
It was pretty bad, huh?
Behind me. I'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff.
Typical male.
I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.
Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
Shut up! Aw...
That's the rock star thing.
No, no.
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
No, no.
No. Life is too short.
No, I'm not worried.
What, they're looking for her?
She's dead.
I'm so burnt-out.
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
I will.
Yo! Your spitting rice all over us! God.
We're your customers. We're not complaining.
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
Please.
I could.
Uh, you know, just admiring the scenery, you know?
Okay.
Hi.
He is.
I'd like to.
Really?
Mm.
Erica.
I'm sorry.
We were?
Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
Yeah, she, uh, works for the record company and takes care of interviews and, you know, shit like that, Uh, we were actually just doin' an interview and Erica said she's like to see Burnfield, so...
Mm-mm.
Always two-fifty, my friend.
He's drunk.
Good. That's good.
Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
Yeah, fuck 'em.
Well, you know, all I can say is, you're a fucking fool.
Oh no, no. You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to me. You lied to me because you're gutless. You're a gutless, drunken looser.
The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking.
What are, what are you doing? Look, Tim, just go home. Alright. Go home and sleep it off.
What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit.
Complicated or not, life moves on. Hm?
Look, look, just get off my property.
Man?
It's a piece.
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
Tim!
... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
So what do you wanna do?
Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
No, no.
I don't know.
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry.
Mm.
Well, what about us?
Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?
Oh, no, no, no.
Just go.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...
The road's hell, you know? I mean airport, hotel, show. And airport, hotel, show. Airport, hotel, show. I mean, fuck, man, you know? You still living at your mom's?
I dropped out. I mean, uh, you know, this semester I'm taking a, a class, you know, three nights a week. But I'm just try-trying to think and work on stuff., you know? I've been doing some writing, though. Short pieces, you know.
What?
Like songs?
Really?
Yeah.
I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine.
Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.
Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!
Hey it's your roof. It's your fucking problem.  Hi, uh, there's an emergency down at the Circle A on first Street, Yeah, Okay.  You're fucked now, pal!  Um, send an ambulance 'cause I, I think it's an overdose or something. Okay. Okay.  Jeff, they're coming. Just wait here. I'm gonna go over to Scuff's and see if he's got his truck.  Listen, if she dies, you're gonna be so sorry that you ever showed your brown face in this town!
You did? I love him. Yeah, you know, I'm thinking of moving to New York.
You have to go. You always did such, uh, you know, great work. I still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall.
Yeah, we'd have to fly you out for meetings, you know.
You done?
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
Yeah. God, you showed up at such a weird time in my life.
Where do you get your ideas?
So, like, your dad's a big deal, right?
I called Bucky's. I got her a cab. Is there any hot mustard?
Don't do that.
Your manager?
Oh that's nice for you.
No car.
Look, it's really not my fault.
Kansas is right.  We're like sisters -- we're closer than sisters.  And you don't turn your back on family.
Wayne Gretzky.
Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
It's off... I can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility. We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls!
I've got to get that.  Relax.  I'll see you tomorrow.
Well, if I had to guess...  I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own...  Jack, do you know what I see here?
Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.
But Di, all this food reminds me of how much I want to teach our baby.
If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
That was gas, Sweetie.
Oh... What are you working on?
Jus some girlie things for the squad.
No.  Wait!  Did I say Promise!  Cross-my heart and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in my-eye we'll never miss a payment?!
Uh, yes.  Yes you did.
Sorry.  My hands are tied.
Just call me later.  I gotta get some smokes for Grandma.
Kim-Lo?
Wrong number  Nooooooo!
Ammo?
Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.
Am I the only one who cares about this? At least I watched "Dog Day Afternoon!"
Uh...maybe?
What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!
Stop it!  This is crazy!
Listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough?
It's from hunger.
I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it.
Exactly what kind of material do you recommend?  James Joyce? Dostoosvsky?
Well....
You don't know how glad I am to see youl
What teacher?
Into something for Barbara Stan- wyck.  They have a commitment with Barbara Stanwyck.
So long.
This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place.
It's just impossible.
And don't make it too dreary.  How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes.  He teaches at night.  Right?  They don't even know each other, but they share the same room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.
Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
Constantly.  No, in all serious- ness, it's really good.  It's fun writing again.  I'm happy here, honest I am.
I'll say.  This is solid gold.
It's that old familiar story, you help a timid little soul across a crowded street.  She turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.
Saddest thing I ever heard.
If you please.
That's it -- there's nothing like being twenty-two.  Now may I suggest that if we're ever to finish this story you keep at least two feet away from me ...  Now back to the typewriter.
He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there.  It would kind of save us a honeymoon.
No, no! I haven't heard any of this.  I never got those telephone calls.  I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here.
Don't play innocent.  Somebody named Gordon Cole.
Nothing.  I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio.  I had no idea how I'd missed it.
Sure.  Wait a minute -- haven't I seen you -- ?
And you have written pictures, haven't you?
Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures.
Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.
I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
They'll love it in Pomona.
I wrote that with my heart.
Of course not.  But it ought to be organized.  Just an editing job.  You can find somebody.
December twenty-first.
Thank you.
Oh no.  I couldn't let it out of my house.  You'll have to finish it here.
Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script.  There's nothing in the deal about my staying here.
Okay.
Tails.  That's ridiculous.
Cut out that us business.
What you're trying to say is that you don't want me to love you.  Is that it?
That's between you and yourself, Norma.
De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
Goodbye.  Norma.
Go on in.
You did, sir. GILLIS' VOICE He goes out.  Gillis     I pegged him as slightly looks after him, hangs   cuckoo, too.  A stroke maybe. his coat over a chair,   Come to think of it, the walks over to the win-   whole place seemed to have dow, pulls down the      been stricken with a kind of rickety Venetian blind.  creeping paralysis, out of As he does so, he looks  beat with the rest of the down at:                 world, crumbling apart in slow motion ...
The doctor suggested it.
She is upstairs.
How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
Sure you are.  And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out?
She never will.  That is my job. It has been for a long time.  You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.  I made her a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed.
Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
Don't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach?  Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo- Romanoff rut, you're through.
If it was a quarrel, how come you had the gun right there?
Who?
I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners.
Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
It's a warning, that's for sure.
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
What's that?
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
That makes it worse.
I can see through walls. I could surprise her. The only thing I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't see the Power Source at the amusement park.
Remember me? We were in a disaster together.
Forget her, you're mine. I saw you first.
I could force you.
If that worked, you would've done it already. No, you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one again.
I'm ready for her. I'll show you.
Why George, are you proposing?
George---I thought you'd never ask.
I knew it ! He's working on a  hot scoop !
You bet your ass.
You're supposed to guess.
It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.
It doesn't seem right.
You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over.
I have to talk to you.
Not doing this for you. Just sick of this place, that's all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling at you. Boring!
Zaltar!
Buddy, are we in trouble.
A natural athlete can play any sport. Any sport.
For reminding me, I mean. Can you follow me?
I didn't --
Old ties are hard to cut.
No. I mean, yes they are, but I was talking about that.  Wheat King. Bet your bottom dollar that's a Wheat King thresher. 
Uh-huh.
Me too. That's why I put this one up.
Kent!
Mmmmm . . .
Nope, but --
Thirty-five.
'Cause I know about getting' them half-centses?
What?
Not "What." Don't need a genius to figure out "what." Need a genius to figure out "where."  He says I'm a genius, your don --  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!  See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into.
Fair's fair.
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
Exactly. Stoned mother.
Join the party, genius! Come on up!
We gonna crash?
We've already met.
And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice, o.s.
I'm in no rush.  So what do you have in mind?
Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
It isn't much, really, you see, there's this little boat. Well, not so little, really. And it's not going where it's supposed to go and...
But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.
Where did it come from?
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
Who needs Gus?
Like fish he is.  I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame.  Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do -- I'd sooner kiss a pig!
Yeah. I'll check.
She'll be fine.
But this should be exposed. They get	kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says.
I didn't think I wanted to.
Let's go to my place.
I know that, Lois. And I wish he were here . . .
Oh, when it comes to you I am. Not that I don't understand why they all need you. but they can't need you more than I do.
Oh, I'm not blaming you.  I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity.  Some rival, huh?
Clark, stop feeling so threatened every time you hear his name. Nobody expects you to be what you're not.
Does Lois know about this yet?
What else is ballast for?
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.
Sensible enough.
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
I didn't ask her anything . . .
Certainly. But - Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice.
We will bring him to his knees!
The bomb! It's in there! Any second now, its --
Oh no.  I really like it sometimes.  And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you.
Listen. Have I got a proposition for you, Superman. I mean I owe you one, you know? Now don't say yes or no till you hear me out . . .
Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
Don't worry, I've got you.
You haven't been at work . . . you didn't call the office . . .  you didn't even call me. How could you not call back?
And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
Do people die in Italian Operas? Gentlemen, if all goes to plan Nuclear Man will return from the sun with power awesome enough to do what none before him has ever been able to . . . pierce Superman's skin. He'll be mortal, he'll get sick . . . and we'll dance on his grave.
I'm sorry.
Absolutely!
N-no...I mean...you bet.
Mr. White, come with me I want to see
I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . .
Daddy . . . ?
Yes, darling?
Our other dinner guest.
That hair contains a sample of Superman's genetic material. The building blocks of his body. With my genius and enough nuclear power to mutate those genes, I will create a being with all his powers . . . but with absolute allegiance to me!
What?
Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
Wait! Not yet! Back!
Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better  --  he needed more energy, more power.
Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
Otherwise, you're a Mongoloid idiot.  It's reasonable to assume that fragments of the planet were shot out into space by the force of the explosion, and  --
Yes, Mr. Luthor. The XK101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected. It also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it. It just goes around it or over it.  The XK101 never quits! It will not stop until it reaches its pre-targeted target!
She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.
No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
I just took a shot at it.
Of this...Superman.
Oh.
You think he's for real?
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.,
Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
See? I see. It's you who don't see. Doesn't see. I cannot believe it! How you people fail to grasp the long-range significance of this! Y'know?
I'm going to bed.
La de da da...
Is that an innuendo, Miss Teschmacher? Because if it is, you are about to experience the heady thrill of being hurled from a moving vehicle.
I know...
Baby -- I'm going to take you higher.
What are you going to do to him?
I'm wearing it.
an Ode to Spring. are there one or two "T's" in bloodletting?
Guess I'd better hitch up the rig and come back to get that...that thing he was settin' in. What do you make of that thing? Martha? You listening?
Yes, true. But on other worlds there would be other problems - heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...No, Lara, believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong.  He will be fast, He will be virtually invulnerable.
Well, physiologically, he...	won't quite fit.
Enjoyed it?
There are none of them any good anyway.
He is. Usually.
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.
I guess I...uh...regressed.
Right, right. Where was I? Ah, yes --
I know. I know.  I never promised myself a rose garden.
For the first time today, Superman I must tell you that you're wrong.  But how could you know that -  Oh, well. I guess I could tell you now. Y'see, actually...but this conversation is becoming rather dry, isn't it.
I'm just fine, Ally.  What about you?
And what does he do again?
He used to work with you.  Until you found out he was having an affair with your wife.
And Zoe?  How's Zoe?
She didn't.
Nothing.  We made it to the hospital.  I didn't have to go as far as I was prepared to.  But I was prepared to go all the way.
I will.
I hope she gets better.
Why are you telling me this?
Okay.
I'm not sure.
She's resting.  In her room.
Well, Sam, I might as well tell you the truth.  It's this lawsuit you've gotten yourself all involved with. I want you to drop the damned thing.
Why not?
That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...
Billy, do you have to smoke? Wendell can smell if someone's been smoking.
Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.
You believe that?
Well I don't.
Oh yes.  Like I said, they always came out together to see him off to school.  It's like he was their little treasure.  He was such a beautiful boy.  That's a picture of him on the wall there, behind Abbott.
For rabbits?
No.  I saw it on his face.
Berries.
Were his parents...attentive to him?
Because I'd be to blame, right?
Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour.  Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.
Yes.  He does.
I don't know.  But it was weird in terms of what happened next.  Sean was still watching his mother.
I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.
Isn't it a lovely day?
Your Dad spent all his spare time in here.  He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.
Oh.
Yes.
What, Mason?
Yes.  Like Bear and the Ansel twins and Sean and...
Crafts.
Wanda does these photographic things.  That's one of her pictures on the wall.
No.
Why are you calling me, Zoe?
Yes.
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
If you could pick the shrimp off, as well as anything that touches the shrimp...
Yes.
Yes.
Positive.
I was scared.  And there wasn't time.
You remember this?
I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything.  And that's all.  I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all.  Then I was in the hospital.
Of course.
Nothing.
What about insurance?  Doesn't insurance pay for these things?
Nothing good on your T.V.?
Great.
But of course...
The next time you want information, Falco, don't scratch for it like a dog - ask for it like a man!
You don't like it, do you.  I think she will accept, but I'm not sure. She may be too dependent on her brother.
Give me a chance --
Nuts!  I'm not here as an artist! I'm here as an average Joe, who happens to love your sister Susie!
He's here, isn't he?  Do you think, sir, when he dies he'll go to the dog and cat heaven?
I'm trying to get Susie to stand up to you.  But your manner is so threatening that she's afraid to speak!
No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...
J.J., Steve isn't...
We're friends, Harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don't we?
I have a message from your sister.
You just had a good example of it. A press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna.
You print them, don't you?
Not "we", Sidney, you!
Ha!  My right hand hasn't seen my left hand for thirty years!
When?
Then maybe you can tell me if he's as solid as you say, why does he rap me every chance he gets?
What's this boy got that Susie likes?
Why give her real proof?  You nearly ruined her with her first husband - and you were right, J.J., - but she almost followed him out the window.  What do you want - a chronic invalid?
Talk to her yourself...
And why should I bribe the woman who holds most of my heart?
No.  That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do.
I don't know - it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed.  In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened.
This sort of thing!
The renting agent and the tailor.
Help me with two minutes of silence!
I know you do, Sidney.
Frank thinks I shouldn't have come here -
Dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife.  So how do you get him doing J.J. a favor?
Good!  We're all off to Utica, so excuse me, Mr. Frannis-on-the- Portisan.
I know that bit - you're a girl; you need a man to give you strength! So what do you pick such weak sisters for?  Don't you know yet that you fight fire with fire, not with tear drops?
Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...
You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
I can't
What chip?
In the bathroom.  Danny, can you get them for us?
My mission is to protect you.
What does that mean?
You sure?
No.  Only an object of equal size.
It can't form complex machines.  Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  It doesn't work that way.  But it can form solid metal shapes.
That is one of my mission parameters.
Prove it... stand on one foot.
No, no, no.  You gotta listen to the way people talk.  See, you don't say like "Affirmative" or some shit like that.  You say... no problemo.
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
I order you not to!
Where'd you learn all this stuff?
Yeah, she's a total loser.  C'mon, let's check out the 7-Eleven, whatya say?
Oh, God... Kyle.  I need you so much.
I'm sure it feels very real to you --
I don't know.
was born here, in Leipzig. I escaped in '36. My parents, they sent me to my uncle in Philadelphia. They were to follow. But they delayed and...
I guess it's possible.
'Dim-shits'?
So what is it?
Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
I've had two meetings with him. He's a great musician. Maybe the greatest conductor in the world. His Brahms, Beethoven, Schubert - unequalled.
No can do.
What's not right?
When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
Why were they going to arrest you?
He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me. He read a report on me - everything I said was quoted word by word.
I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost.
Tell me about von der Null.
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
Now, that young conductor what's his name?  That miracle kid, you know who I mean. Von Karajan! But you called him something else. C'mon. What did you call von Karajan?
Yes, that's what happened.
Hans Hinkel was in the Ministry of Culture; how could I know such a man?  I
Do you know what's in this archive?
Show you?
Yeah, show me, I want to see you do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same.
One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one'?
Fuck that, Helmuth. You want to discuss symbols here?  This guy was a front man. He was the piper, but he played their tune, you get my philosophical meaning?  I'm not interested in small fish, I'm after Moby Dick. Come on, Helmuth. Hard facts.
No. But that's why we hated him. We admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didn't have to join the Party and yet he had a better life than any of us. He didn't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad. He got everything from them, everything. He was filthier than any of us Party members.
Never heard of him, who is he?
His private life?
Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor?
Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?

You must have a girlfriend.
That's none of your business.
No.  Not yet.  Not for about forty years.
John gave me a message for you.  Made me memorize it. 'Sarah"...this is the message... 'Sarah, thank you.  For your courage through the dark years. I can't help you with what you must soon face, except to tell you that the future is not set... there is no such thing as Fate, but what we make for ourselves by our own will.  You must be stronger than you imagine you can be.  You must survive, or I will never exist.'  That's all.
About what?
About where you're from.
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.
No.  Never.
Oh, Kyle.
SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
Yes.
Can't.  Nobody goes home. Nobody else comes through. It's just him and me.
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
I guess so.  You're a doctor?
Six shots at less than ten feet.  Weapon was a large caliber--
I put a cigarette out in it.
Send a unit.
I just called.
Admittedly...
Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter.  We're up eight cents per share.
It probably will.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time.  Why should I settle for that?
There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.
You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
Then, you kiss his ass.
I apologized, I offered to help.
Clean out your locker.
What's going on?  I'm going on my second job this month, and now I'm going on unemployment.
Don't explain.  Fuck off.  Goodbye.
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
I'm sorry, about this...
How thoughtful.  The gift of inconvenience.
This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?
I'm not wearing underwear.  Okay? There, I said it.  Satisfied.
What's C.R.S.?
I think not.
Come here...
It was left in my hotel room, well, not really mine.  You're saying it's not you?
I think I would remember.  What makes you think it's me?
Not here!  They can see.
I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.
I didn't say anything.
All I mean is... someone like you...
What?
Nicholas...
You call them...
What are you doing?
I saw them kill him!
Please, Nicholas, let me show you...
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Single?
About me?
Never better.
Nowhere in particular.  Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
Fun?
This isn't an escort service?
You dodged a bullet.
How do you know?
What?  Connie...
It always is.
Happy Birthday, Nicholas.
No, thank you.
And if nothing's lacking?
How do I find them?  Their offices are empty.
They own the whole building.  They just move from floor to floor.
Where'd you pick up your checks?
It was a different floor then...
Like, this way... sort of...
Not much, I think.
You're not like him at all.  I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.
Look, where is he?!
No.
Let me think...  Hordes of men in tuxedos.  Everyone's droning.  Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick...
It's what they do.  It's like... being toyed with by a bunch of...  Depraved children.
Greetings fellow sheep counter.
And what kind of sleeper?
I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
Yeah.
Go ahead.
Do we still get paid for the week?
You get your money.
She got the child labor stuff from me.
Nah, you're going crazy with doubt, all of your mistakes are coming back up the pipes, and it's worse than a nightmare. --
Luke.
No.
And after she was thrown out, she needed a job.
She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.
That smell... oh, God.
What happened after you smelled it?
Like she smelled it too?
I got more scared.
I wish I were.  I wish I had done it, then I could confess and you'd be at peace.  That great moral philosopher Frank Sinatra once said to someone he loved, I wish you had an enemy, so I could beat him up.
It was a stupid thing to do.
It was.
Nell.  You will come here now.
Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
No --
Test it.
That's a good question.  What is it about fences?  Sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable.  Why would that be?
Who?
No one will come any nearer than that.
What did it cost?
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
What do you do?
Come on!  Why are we waiting?
It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.
It must've been a time.  A golden moment.
Come over here.
How'd you like to kill someone for me?
Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
I don't know everyone here.  He was so traumatized he split.  Maybe he was Gordon's <u>pusher</u>.
No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.
I wouldn't talk.
You're in gun country now, my friend.
Been to the Boat Show.
Packs a punch, but it's compact, has accessible features -- makes a nice concealed-carry piece.
I mean, what has it been -- six months?
I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles.  She had her life, I had mine.
Y'what?
This ain't your lot?
She didn't know what to say.  I thought someone should say something. To someone.  With me it was, I don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason.  I felt like I owed her.
Well, there you are.  Jen must've liked him.
One thing I need.
No, why did you come here?
What was that, then?
Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
Yesterday.  Afternoon.
Nah, accommodation address.
Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.
You don't believe it was a car accident.
Tell us about it.
A jeweller's up the West End.  We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- <u>after</u> we'd made the grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.
From pursuing your chosen profession.
Who remembers.
Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill.  Watching Doris Day.
A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.
Well, I'll tell you.  I believe this Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money.
Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.
That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
It was you.  Downtown.
He had urgent business in the north.
You're a reluctant traveller, then.
No rest for the wicked.
But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.
Sounds like you need a rest.
Five thousand.
Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.
Something's on.
What?
"He ain't wrong."  Listen, I know this asshole who <u>did</u> just go to work for him. Full-time.  And this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast.  <u>That's</u> the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job.
I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.
Walked.
You walked.  What the hell are you doing here.
Looking for a bloke named Valentine. Know him?
What do you think?
Ann--
Hello, Birdy. I thought that was very good.
Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest--
But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...
Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
Ah, but that is just what I cannot teach. I cannot teach her to have a soul. Look, monsieur, play the piano, is not about the fingers. *Done* with the fingers, yes. But the music, she is inside. Inside, monsieur...
It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.
That's right! Dry cleaning--remember the name. It's going to revolutionize the laundry industry, and those that get in early are gonna bear the fruit away. All I need is $10,000 to open my first store, then I use its cash flow to finance another, and so on-- leap frog, bootstrap myself a whole chain. Well, me and a partner. Cleanliness, friend. There's money in it. There's a future. There's room to grow... Say, that's looking pretty good. Let's see it with the hairpiece on...
Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--I want the dough; I don't take attendance.
All right.
Uh-huh.
Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
Well, you know what that would do to me.
Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.
Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.
What happened to you?
Don't tell 'em anything. We're getting you Freddy Riedenschneider.
I took Doris's keys.
Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth.
...a puny player on the great world's stage...
So--
Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?
Sorry, I just didn't remember.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare the kid.
The hell with it, Eddie!
Uh-huh.
Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing well enough to turn away business! More power to ya, brother! The public be damned!
Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here.
Homicide.
As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. Does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious?
Under arrest for murder.
Anything missin'?
Behind you.
The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito.  Why don't you just tell me how this space station works.
That's great if you're stopping a burglar.  Not our goal here.  Are there motion detectors?
They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story.  Nice touch.
Oh.
Apparently it's huge.
Dr. Green has to see you!
You're asking me?  I don't even know how to load this thing.
Now Margo, don't overreact.  Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow.  My leaving makes perfect sense.  This isn't exactly early retirement.  I've overstayed the party a bit.
That, apparently, is the problem. I'm yesterday's news.  Who needs a Curator of Plant Biology in a museum with one exhibit on plants?  Monsters and dinosaurs, cannibals and shamans are the new currency of the realm.
Let me help.  I can take care of everything.
You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.
You're right.
That's not so unusual.  Many plants carry viruses.  Like the burls on Maple trees.
So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
"Dear Louis, Tomorrow we go to the south end of the tepui where we'll be in the greatest danger, so I'm sending Carlos back with the crates.  You always believed in me, Louis, even in the darkest days.  So it gives me great pleasure to tell you your faith has been rewarded.  We've made an incredible find.  I enclose a representation of Mbwun.  Note the exaggerated claws, the reptilian attributes, the hints of bipedalia. It's beyond belief, but this statue is accurate.  I know because I've seen the beast."
I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?
Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
She's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs.  That lady said they were on the fourth floor.
Don't be a wuss.  Come on.
Not that big.
Like this.
It's alright.  I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone.  What is this place?
But at what a price.
It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.
Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.
Yes, he's fine.  Greg... take care of yourself!
The people killed were mauled and their brains were eaten.  Just like Beauregard.  One part of the brain was extracted with surgical precision.  The hypothalamus and thalamus to be exact.
A legendary monster called Mbwun.
What happened?
My God.  Then it was an animal.
I'm in town on a case.  Dropped by to see Vince and we thought we'd see the new display.
One.
As you know ratings have never been our primary goal.  I imagine we'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment.  However, I'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal.
I think I've studied enough.
<i>Spare room</i> - I can start thinking about selling up...and I'll be gone.  Up and away on that big steel bird.  I'm going, don't you worry about that.
I think it's got something to do with my dad.
I think he's alive.  I'll tell you about it later.  I'm definitely being followed.
Could be.  Beard looks phony.  It's when I'm unpredictable.  They can't stand that.  That's why we've got to get out of here.  Can you come with me?
Yeah...
Truman, you're gonna be late!
I bet you did.
--What the hell are you talking about?!
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
Truman, stop it!
--Truman, you're gonna be late!
Good.  Good.
You're not FBI agents.
A woman?  Work.
When was that?
This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.
Of what?
We have a situation. The members are assembling.
No. Don't bother.
Have you examined them?
No. Just fossils, far as I know.
What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
You know my work?
You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
What?
A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.
Yeah, well I don't have them all.
You didn't know my father --
What's wrong, Scully?
I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.
How's that?
Oh yeah. Had you big time.
Scully, I found the bomb.
Nice try, Mulder.
Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
What? What are you talking about?
I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
Why?
I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
They were the ones that put us together.
There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore.  Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.
Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.
I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense here --
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
It looks pretty green for this climate.
I don't know why I think they went right.
-- of what exactly?!
Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --
I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --
You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
I've got no allergy. Something... this... Mulder... I think... I think you should call an ambulance.
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
About what?
-- if it looks bad, it's bad for the FBI --
Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
I'm not taking any chances.
You're lying.
The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years.  Or it may not.
What alien environment?
Well, without a cure for the virus, we're nothing more than digestives anyway.
No, you need only take away what is most precious to him.
Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.
Lucien Baines?
She thinks I can bring Edward back.
Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?
Okay.
Four and twenty blackbirds...
I know.
Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.
You're the shrink, you tell me.
What happened to Charles Gish?
So you say.
's broken.
They took care of that, thank you, Henry. 
That was with Edward.  She's accustomed to his world.  Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  She's "lost."  Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening.  And get her out.  Until then, she's at his mercy.
No.
Let's give old Carl a call.  Tell him he's got company.
No, he never told me about his friends. Would you like some tea?
That was the man that brought me some money when Harry died. He said Harry had been anxious at the last moment.
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
Yes.
There's something wrong. Did you tell Calloway about meeting Harry?
Why are you lying?
They're Harry's.
That's the reason.
What can I tell you but that you have got everything upside down.
Poor Harry, I wish he was dead, he would be safe from all of you then.
That's all right, miss, don't worry. We're used to it - like doctors.
Well, I'll be saying good night. Good night, Miss.
Martins.
Holly Martins.
What are you trying to say?
Are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder?
Yes, yes, yes, and then he vanished out there, I suppose with a puff of smoke and like a clap of...
I'll be your dumb decoy duck.
No, I don't know...
Yes, Cultural re-education Section Propaganda. Very important in a place like this. We do a little show each week. Last week we did "Hamlet" and the week before we had something...
I know a very good dentist.
Oh, he's very goad, sir. I've read quite a few of his books.
Listen...
You've got plenty of contacts.
I can tell you very little. He was run over by a car. He was dead when I arrived.
You don't mean that doctor?
Suppose I take...
Das hat man davon wenn man freundlich ist mit den auslandern...
I am not a bad man.
Joseph Harbin? No...no.
Not when I get interested.
His name?
I thought he'd be here to meet me.
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
We moved rooms because of him.
One or two kilometers.
Not too bad.
The Zionists aren't Nazis.
They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....
We'll go to the country sometime, okay?
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
No, you don't.... If you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. You know what tefillin is? Tsitsis? Shotness? You know the kaddish from the kiddush?  Eichmann? He went to Israel. He studied the Torah, the Talmud, the Mishnah, the whole bit. He hated Jews.
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
V'asitem lechem pessel to-monat. And make no graven image of the Lord, or the form of any figure, or of man or woman, or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything. Because He's not like anything. Not only can't you see Him or hear Him, you can't even think about Him. I mean, what's the difference between that and Him not existing?
And belief follows?
Okay...  Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish.
Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.
Lina, come here!
Nothing.  Why are you doing this?  I thought God didn't exist.
I don't. I was just curious how full of shit you were.
How would you kill him?
What about Mrs. Moebius and...?
A week or so. There's something I want to do here first.
The other night you said the modern world is a Jewish disease. Could you elaborate on that?
Danny, what about the Jews?
Did you ever fuck one, Guy?
Jewish girls like to give head, right?
I don't know. Is that right?
Because the Jew is essentially female.
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
Those aren't Jews.
Do you know who you're fucking with here?
Give me a reason not to.
Does that mean you deny what he says is true? Yes or no.
No.
How do you reconcile the two?
Who killed Manzetti?
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
The arguments, anyway.
I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.
I can't say that.
The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
I don't do that.
So what Jew would you kill first?
Fine.
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
I just came to get some stuff. I'll be out in five minutes.  He doesn't want me around.
They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.
So what do we do with the device?
No, it has to be tomorrow. You won't get this many of them in here for another year. It'll be fine.
So that's what? Nineteen thirty minutes...what time is it now...
Okay, that's it. You're going back to --
Look, if you want to kill Jews on your free time, fine. We need you to raise money. Will you do that for us?
... You take care of yourself, Johana.
The documents are forged.
No!
I tried him, he can't go.  His son is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow... I'll go, boss.
Italian is practically the same thing.
I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
You're right.  You're fired.
The Italian, I presume?
No.  He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
Congratulations.
Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!
Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
Okay.
That idiot!
What does that mean?
Very chic.  Anyway, you don't have anything else, do you?
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
And where did you say you were from?
And... does the voice come back?
Hey!  D'you have any other complaints?  Just make a list and we'll stick it on the porthole! Okay?
Fine!
Me neither, 'cause of my Mother. She's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado. Stubborn as a mule!  I was engaged... for a week.  After that, Mamma was so mad, I tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls.
People say that?
If we don't... I'm going to beat you.
Driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road.
Yes.
In the lake?
Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
Ah?!
No, no.  Johana is visiting me.
It's my apartment.
Louis, we were French!
Again?
Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed?  I've been a jerk, right?  I should have stayed!  I was supposed to be in love... I was in love!  I am in love, why did I act like a bitch?  He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy.  It was too good to be true.
I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
What's your first move?
About an hour ago, we received this transmission from the North Pole.
I love her sir. If I don't help you, I won't be able to make her my wife. Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim has agreed to come with me to the North Pole on a rescue mission.
How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
C'mon follow me.
Now we wait for Santa to make his next move.
Afterwards they'll make the decision as to whether or not they'd like to continue their religious studies in Israel. Because, hey, after all we'll have practiced the highly effective assertive democratic style of child rearing, sprinkled with a healthy dose of liberalism.
I forgive you.
Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos.
...So you saved Hanukkah Mr. Big Shot. I mean, let's be honest Mordechai, it isn't even one of the high holidays.
Yeah, I'm going to be out of the office from 1:30 to 3:00 on Sunday. I have a terrible yeast infection and I need to see my gynecologist.
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.
He's still working out some identity issues.
Offscreen gunfire. That Jewish Atomic Clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget.
The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive.
Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on me Hammer. I'm too strong for it.
Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples.
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
I can't understand that fancy talk.  You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?
Who's Carlos Dom-what's-his-name?
What about me?
You get your money from your husband.
If a leopard didn't do it, who did?
I drink.
That's just it, Charlie. That's what I'm driving at. You could do anything in that time.
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
What arroyo - how did you get to it 
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
The elderly man I told you about.
What are you doing that for?
Let me see it 
Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches 
Hey  I'm over here.
I'll miss you too, honey --
You're worrying about its killing someone else?
Don't feel so concerned, Jerry.
Caged animals are unpredictable. They're like frustrated human beings. I can't answer your question.
But he would have to know about leopards - have access to leopard claws and hair.
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
I don't know.
But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
All right -- the dead, then.  In history there must have been men like that -- men with kinks in their brains --
Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.
I thought they came right past here 
Something's wrong with this whole setup --
On his back, I suppose.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
On his back, I suppose.
And I never will -- you know what's between us - we're a thing -- But this is serious -- big competition.
Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
You remember the fellow this morning -- Galbraith. You've got time before the supper show.
You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.
That's funny -- I never knew you to lose that much before --
Well, Leon does not need money for prints, Mr Lombard. Does his own printing. Wouldnt want anyone to interfere with his Art!  Which, as he subsequently vanished, raises the question: what was the money for? Perish the thought.
Can it be that you want your brother found?
I need the money to smooth my way, you understand? Now, have you got that sort of cash here or do we need to meet in the morning?
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
The man who sold the boy to your brother.
The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...
Whats in the bag? Underwear? To seduce your husband? Or is it for your own recreation?  Tell me, how come such a handsome couple sleep in seperate bedrooms? Is it because he does it with little children?
Youre mad...
Adonis thought your brothers bodyd be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didnt he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
Is there anything to understand?
Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.
Five years of it. Surely, youd have divorced him if he disgusted you?
You splendid bastard...
...Were turning in circles.
And you still havent told me why you sent me after Friedman.
I didnt intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that youd been back.  That wed argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldnt help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
Youre a long way from home...
Im fine standing, thank you.
The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
I thought youd never ask... As I was having my coffee and crescents at the Mondrian the other morning I spotted your photograph in the Los Angeles Times... Theres a tough lady, I thought. Just the kind who might help me...
Did you call me up here to enjoy yourself, Emily, or to let me use your phone? Because we seem to have a slight problem...
Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
I think so. And if it comes to it, tell the cops anything you think will make them move. Whatever you came up with couldnt come close to how bad it is. Bye now.
Italian? The Mafia...?
A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think Ill get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, itll be too late.
I see. How much?
Fifteen for a straight delivery. Twenty with the provision of a safe place. Visitors tend to find the second option more convenient.
Where are we?
Finsbury Park. Were in Finsbury Park.
And who does Friedman work for?
Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?
Must be your lucky day then. Ive got your accounts - you dont owe much tax for last year.
Thanks for cleaning my flat and sending my money, all right?... Come on, I need you. Its important.
Thank you, Jane.
Ha... No, Mr Lombard. His monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us. He knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate.
Fine. One more thing, Mrs and Mr Spitz; may I ask what is or was your occupation?
Does it matter?
Clients come and go.
Maybe the thought of people like you going on holiday bothers me. Come on, lets go...
Could someone have hurt you that bad?
At what time will you be available?
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
Ill be alone.
...Leons not here. How did you get here? Phil doesnt know where I live.
The nineteenth... How come you didnt know?
Er... Yes...
Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
... No.
Three days and thats three days too many.Come on. Get your ass up.
Oh. Thatd be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...
O est pass ton salon?
Fuck...
Huh! You turned him into a liability, didnt you know?
Huh. Maybe he figured the news our London bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldnt go down too well. He only shared his guilty secret last night. And then only cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk.
What sums?
Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasnt easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, whats your business with these Spitzes?
Mossad?
Jeanne's been badly injured!  She jumped from the top of a tower into a frozen moat!
Do you think I could have some water?
Yes, I am.  I'm an archer who can read and write.  Who do you want to write to?
Jeanne, calm down.  You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.
No, it's... it's nothing, it's...
It's over, Jeanne.  We won, just as you said!
He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
Yes yes... any moment... you're always so impatient...
One day you will.
I'm staying, Jean.
I tried to.
And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?
I leave the answer to God.
No, I... I held it up to...
Yes...
And may I go to Mass?
You think?
The other half.
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
Go and ask him yourself.
I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.
Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  What makes you think they'll listen to you?
Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
Xaintrailles...!  Don't talk to me about miracles...  If I was still sitting there waiting for a miracle, I'd be dead now. Anyway...
Damn right!
Reinforcements?  Where??
But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
But my voices... they promised me...
No!
Because... because you just can't!
They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
Don't swear...
A few teeth... that's the price of his life?
And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace?  You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
I told you already... I'm here to set you free...
I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I won't bother you.
Whose were they?
I'm sure he'll forgive you.
Jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church.
He'll be here soon.
Let's find out.
What's happened?
I haven't seen him.
Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
Okay, then I'll tell you something funny. You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja.
Otherwise what?
Yes, but what good did it do?
Not this week.
Why didn't you come to me?
...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
Bitch!
Dirty pig!
I was listening, Kitten.
It's a little cut, nothing.
Stop it, Wladek.
Where do you live?
The Russians. On the other side of the river.  All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks.
Watch your feet!
It will be very dramatic.
Ohh the tag is broken.
The Alps.
Mother used to sing the songs in German and her voice would echo across the valleys
Yes, it's unholy.
No, no bible readers.
I'll be back.
No, I love her, we will be a family. I have her piano. I will mend it, she will get better.
She's stunted, that's one thing.
Yes, I suppose you would.
Well, thank you, I expect she will appreciate it.
Spoken words?
Jesus! I'll kill him! I'll kill him. What did she tell him?
I have the key here, look, I'll have it mended...
Hello.
She never gives him a turn.
Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.
Joliet badge, Snyder.  Don't cut much up here.
No, no cops!
Thanks.  I'm obliged to ya, but I gotta get goin'. 
It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now.
I got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me.
If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.
Mottola.
All right, mark Mottola up a little and put him on a bus.  Nothin' fancy, just enough to keep him from coming back.  Get some local people to take care of the other two.  We gotta discourage this kinda thing.
They staked out the other guy's place last night, but he never showed.  They figure maybe he skipped town.  You wanna follow 'em up?
Nothin'.  They gotta be outa there early.  I'm gonna bust that bastard in one play.
Lonnegan after you, too?
You never do, kid.
We'll get by without 'em.
If I can find a mob that'll risk it. But no matter what happens, I don't want you comin' back to me halfway through and sayin' it's not enough... cause it's all you got.
If we ever get to it.
Naw, I'd just blow it.
I also gotta win.
Not enough to cover a bet that big.
If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever.
He wants to put a half million on Syphon.
What!  Don't give me that crap you little weenie.  How do I know you ain't gonna take a powder.  You come to a game like this, you bring your money.
The name is Lonnegan.
Don't have much choice, do ya?
You're crazy.  I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.
Nobody can buy you a prayer, if I put the finger on ya.
You doin' anything tonight?
He'd like to kill me.
You know me.  I'm just like you... It's two in the morning and I don't know nobody.
Give 'em a little time.
But who says you will.  I got a guy I can depend on.  He's liquidating everything he has for this.  You wouldn't even give Carver his money back.
All right, get outa here.  You're outta work.
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.
No.
Why not?
Then just say he was sixty years old.
Of course.
And if it isn't?
Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.
You're high enough.
Give it to me.
Nothing.
I didn't.
I don't think you will.  It's your father's.
Tch-tch-tch --  Well, goodbye, Miss Wynant.  You wouldn't drive slowly, so you don't get a tip.
Yes.  Some nut who wanted to kill him.  How is your father?
Macaulay.
A new invention?
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
That's one thing I won't forget.  Where's Macaulay?  I ought to be starting.
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
I'm very interested in that body.
Okay.  There's plenty of time. I guess we got to ask you a lot more questions than we counted on. We'll come up tomorrow when you're feeling better.  Come on.
For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
Trail him!  Trail who?
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
Rosebreen.
Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.
When was that?
I didn't mean you, Mister.
I couldn't go near that woman.
This is the first time I've seen him in years.  I didn't want him to think I was high-hatting him.
supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ?
Oh, he's sitting up.
So did we.  I mean, Sherlock here.
I wish you'd count them.  There's a thousand dollars there.
I see.  I see.
He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.
And the murderer is right here in this room tonight... he's sitting at this table.  You may serve the fish.
Macaulay, you drew up Wynant's will.  Mimi was cut off, wasn't she, if she re-married?
We need ice.
Yes.
Can't you get to sleep?
Tomorrow I'll buy you a whole lot of detective stories.
I think I would like that drink.  I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
You'll have to keep them anyway. The man at the Aquarium said that he wouldn't take them back.
Yeah.
Let's see.  Where's it from?
Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
Oh take it!  Please take it!
You talk as if I were Asta.
I don't believe he did it.
Why don't you?
No reason.  Just a hunch.  But I'm going to find out.  I'm tired of being pushed around.
Sure I will.
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
That's what they think... Guild and all of them.  They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims.  Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.
What things made you so sure?
Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
Well, don't they?
I don't know.
It's the only way it makes sense.
You worked here?
Yes.
I know I left them there.
Who fired you?
Y-yes.
Turn the car around.
Can you eat it?  If you can't eat it I really don't care what it is.
Better grab up some sand to take home to your family.
I'd settle for being alive.  Really. Alive would be fine.
Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
Low on gas.  Got to refill.
How tough you have to be to make the army?  All you've got to do is shoot a gun, and stop a bullet.
Got to be some kind of landmark; something distinctive.
You don't know that.
We thought--
I did it!  I got the box open.
Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.
I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
Mine.
I heard it click.
Just be cool.
We're going to be right over here.
Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.
Shut up and listen!
It's a fire fight.
I hope it means something, otherwise...
Stay low.
Just stay down.
Get up and dig.
Is it dead?
What's to stop him if he wanted to?  All he has to do is cut the line...
I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.
Yeah, I guess we should.
Well, you're going to start with a bang, 'cause you've got four of them to take down.
We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up.  Get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot.
Is that good, or bad?
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
You were shot.  We were standing right there, you were shot!
The...the gold...
What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
Don't even try it.  You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.
What is it?  You know so much about Arabland tell me what it is.
We're going to war, aren't we.  If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
What!?
What?
Oh, no.
I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
How the hell should I know how much?
Oh, God!
Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
I know you're a pussy.  I know that.
Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
Lines up with the map and the photos.
You've seen enough.
Look,dirt!
That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.
You don't know.  You don't....
AH UGH.
You're in violation.
Look!
That way.
Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
You don't know that!
I did not accept any.  I...  I wanted... to.  But I didn't. You know I didn't.  Don't you?
Aren't you on suspension?
Anything else I should know?
Hey, look--
Sounds like terrorist heaven.
We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
Congratulations, you just built your first ticker.
Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.
Would you?
What do we do?
Don't touch that.
Bev, give `em a call, find out what bowling alleys they supply in this area.
We're a bit busy at the moment, I'll give you a statement in a few minutes if we're still alive.
I was wrong... this didn't come from any cash register.
Let's face it, we all knew it would happen sooner or later. The guy who can build a mousetrap that's better than we are ...
We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.
Stay here.
What? Nobody, I-
You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
Time for bed, kiddos. Say goodnight.
Awright! How bout you, Glass, how's that chip shaking?
Nah, let's just take a look-see.
Captain assigned me to assist you.
My first undercover assignment. I gotta look good, right?
Sir, I--
It's detonation cord, for a bomb.
Goddamit, Reilly--
Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.
Yes.
in doorway. He bows, returns into office; door shuts.
So I said to myself, "All right, if he wants to look at them, let him look at them. No harm in that." And then he said, "Say ah." And then I said, "Ah." And that's all I remember ... And when I woke up, I still had my tonsils, but my pocketbook was gone.
Constantinople?
Umm.
Smart. London, eh?
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
Um-hum. Very good. Excellent!
I want to see that moon in the champagne.
I want to see-- 
Thank you.
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
I don't <u>know</u>, M'sieu Giron!
Otherwise I'll call the police
The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby. But I don't think he saw me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank heaven! ... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia!
Please.
You're very welcome.  Countess, believe me, before you left this room I would have told you everything ... And let me say this with love in my heart-- Countess, you are a thief.  The wallet of the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine is in your possession. I knew it very well when you took it out of my pocket.  In fact, you tickled me.  But your embrace was so sweet ... 
Not at all, Countess ... There's one very good stone in it.
Right.
Certainly!
Darling, remember you're Gaston Monescu. You're a crook. I want you as a crook. I love you as a crook. I worship you as a crook. Steal, swindle, rob--but don't become one of those useless, good-for-nothing gigolos!
Yes--Filiba! Venice--Grand Hotel-- room two fifty-three--
No--not yet--but--  Two tickets to Berlin--first class and sleeper--night train ... Right ... Right ... Leave them in the name of--Don Ignacio Fernandez ... Right ... Thank you. 
You <u>have</u> to get out of here!
That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--
Lily, you must listen to me.
Lily-- 
Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
The pleasure is mine, madame.
What's wrong now?
No, no, no!  I disagree with you completely! I tried it once--
Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.
Oh? 
This used to be my secretary's room.
I see.  She must have been very happy here.
No! Not enough!  In times like these, when everything is uncertain, every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune within arm's reach.
Then I mislay my checkbook--
Correct!  Good night.
No--yours, madame.
Yes, I would!
And you're going to fall for them.
You're conceited--
Instantly.
<u>Adolph</u>?
Giron...!
Yes, Giron! Chairman of the board of Colet and Company. Honorary president of the Orphans' Asylum. Adolph J. Giron--distinguished citizen! ... Well, shall I call the police?  I see! You have to be in the social register to keep out of jail. But when a man starts at the bottom and works his way up--a self-made crook --then you say, "Call the police! Put him behind bars! Lock him up!" 
Divine ...
But it could have been glorious.
Lovely.
Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead.
Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.
But you saw it here.
You are, Lewis.  You rolling?
...Mrs. Calvert?
We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet...  ...isn't letting any men in at all.
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.
He'll never amount to a thing, trust me. At least they were cheap.
Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.
I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
Well if that's what it takes for us two to get warm, I'd rather not, if it's all the same.
You would have done it already. Now come on, take my hand.
Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
I've got you. I won't let go.
That's quite a moniker. I may hafta get you to write that down.
Worse I'm afraid.
Well, I guess I will tonight.
Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
I have to get back, they'll miss me. Please, Jack, for both our sakes, leave me alone.
Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out.
He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...
This is crazy.
I know, I know.
Yes sir.
Do you want the truth, Anya?
And <U>do</U> bring Miss Marsh--  --when she's had time to tidy up a bit.
Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
I didn't ask you to come away with me--
No, darling, lip rouge--all over your mouth.
Thanks.
Why worry? It was insured--how about that swimming lesson I promised you?
I think you do.
Oh, no--I played with <U>your</U> cards--in <U>your</U> cabin--at <U>your</U> suggestion--If you've got a kick coming, make it to the Purser.
Want to take it back?
Yes--
Mr Denby and Mr. McKinney.
Married?
I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.
At seven-thirty?
Anything I can do?  I'd jump overboard if it'd help you.
Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?--
A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.
Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.
I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
Well, I had to get some dough to play with those suckers. Here, get this changed.
That's where you come in. Now, listen, Shortie--
Oh, is she? What a shame!  You'll pardon me?
See you later, Shortie--I'm off to the pool.
Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.
I'll go with you--
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
I'm sorry to hear that.
How?
Fine! Instead of saying "next month"--we'll use one word and say "June."
Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
I can see you're no gentleman--
So what?
She's in New York.
It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
Are you paying any attention to his jokes?--the first thing you know, you'll be taking piano lessons from Venus de Milo--  Get out of here. 
Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all <U>Nice</U> people--
Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months--you'll soon forget all about it.
Very--
I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
Very good, Mary--
I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?
The country boy's about due.
Because I want you--will always want you--no other woman'll ever take your place.  I want you more now than I did that first night--  You've forgotten all that, I suppose?
Get wise to yourself, Sally--you're no sob story.
--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
It all depends on what you're used to.
I was in his cabin--
Hey--you! Where you going?
Because you ran after me.
Why Ed, what an ugly thing to Say!  Does this mean you're not my Friend anymore?  You know, Ed, if I thought you weren't my friend I Don't think I could bear it.
A peace officer... Impressive man
Not now.  I don't have time.
I don't understand.
He was quoting the bible, Revelations: "Behold a pale horse And the one that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him."
Crack me back of the head like Some stinkin' bull.  Hell, you Ain't no fightin' man, you're Just a cop.
Make you a deal.  My brother took Over the Marshal's office in Tombstone.  Got it in his head He's gonna make the place safe For widows and orphans.  You and Your boys stay out of his way, I'll make sure he stays out of yours.
They were all gonna jump me back There.  What ever happened to one Against one?
Ain't our way.  We go all on one, One on all.  Fight one of us, you Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.
Well... 'bye.
I said forget it, answer's no, I Don't want the job and that's Final.  I'm going to Tombstone and Nothin' short of dyin's gonn Stop me.  Good day.
No Marshal, you don't understand. I'm through with lawing, I'm Through with the whole Proposition.  Forever.  I did my Duty, now I'd like to get on with My life.  That is if you don't Mind.  Jesus.  Good day now.
Already got a guilty conscience, Might as well have the money too.
Better.
Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?
And what a maiden, pure as the Driven snow, I'm sure.
I don't know.  Probably ignore her.
I stand corrected.  Wyatt.  You're An oak.
But Doc-
Never got to wear one of those.
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?
Run.  Take that girl and start Running.  Run and don't look back. All your life you been running And looking back and just barely Existing and calling it getting By.  This time run and don't look Back and call it living.  Live Every second, live it right up to The hilt.  Live, Wyatt...  Live for me.
What?
Awful lot of money.
Wyatt, are you crazy?
He's right, Wyatt.  Ringo could Put five into you before you Could even get one into him.
I know what it means.
I laugh sometimes
Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are You happy?
Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored.  That blonde Woman, is that your wife?
I don't know, doesn't make any Sense.  I almost can't look at You.  Like it hurts.
You feel bad about this?  About me?
I can't, I'm sorry.  Forgive me.
Wait!
Did you ever see the sun come up Over the Rockies?  It hits all of A sudden and below there's California and you swear you're Looking at heaven.
Don't worry, Wyatt.  My family's rich.
Honey, I gotta start makin' money.
No really, I can stay a while.
You're the boss.  One thing, though.
We'll go around that way, come up on foot.
Hope so.  Clean up with this boy.
Got me.  Somethin'.  Nothin'.  I Don't know.
Come on, we're not about pickin' Fights.  Just gonna keep a little Order, that's all.
Hit a streak when we left.  Him And Kate.
You are the one, Wyatt.  You sure are.
Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
Look at 'em all.  They love it. How in the hell'd we get Ourselves into this?
No, I gotta do something.  I don't Suppose you'd card-
I'm on my way.
Sir Elliot.
I can feel your pain.
Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?
- Instant melt-down.
Him? He, is a she -  at the bar.
That hardly makes up for the imposition.  Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007.  First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.
... 17 Beverage cup holders?
Standard equipment. The world's automobile manufacturers seem to be in some kind of mad war to see who can provide the most beverage cup holders.
Perhaps. But it does explain how an ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people.  If you believe what you read in the papers.
Come on. I know better than that -
Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?
Hey - the world is my office.
Something with an engine? Not oars?
He tied one on.
Wait a minute -  I've got it. There! Off the port bow!
That's reassuring.
I'm not certain... But I think there's someone I want to press for some answers in Kuala Lumpur.
Three. You? Married?
Thanks.  Take care -
You too.
Sidney Winch.
You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life...  ...But she won't kill us.
My father left me the business.
... We have time for that?
We blast through.
... Yes?
Now.
Of course.
I understand.
What do you make of all this?
Mandarin. You jerk.  I'm late. I have to get dressed.
Excellent.
Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.
...I see.
Thank you, Uncle Elliot.
You come with me -  You stay here.
Good. We have an appointment in Hong Kong.
One to seven: Deal the face cards.
Meaning there may be nuclear material down there?
Will the cruise set it off?
Junior spends time with his child.
I preached to Mom and Dad about it but they are stuck in their ways, it's like talking to a brick. But if there is a way...
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
Can't I be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong? The world is not black and white. Show me one perfect person. If you can't, don't ask me to be.
It is just a regular card.
This would be a bad time for me to leave.
I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it.  Son, you make me wish I was dead.
Gideon, don't say things like that.
You must have been really sick.
I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
I'm worn out but won't you feel like you are taking in a stranger?
It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home.
You're suppose to teach your children what you know. Junior, I don't have to worry about. Babe Brother is a different story.
I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.
Let me earn my keep. I'll go out and get a hen and have it picked and ready for the pot. Try to make him some cow tea next time.
Hattie is a different person now.
You invited me.
Wasn't Hocker lynched?
Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
Some people grow up and change their ways.
Now I was trying to be nice, to make conversation, since we go back some.
I already have, my dear.
Ya, but you can't do the shuffle with one leg. You and your wife, in your spare time, work with the less fortunate. Now I'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim, deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying.
You never know what's in the heart and just because you can cry doesn't make you human.
I haven't heard anyone mention Swamp Root since button-up shoes went out.
Harry always shows his good side and, like the moon, the other side is black. Back home he always did try to act like the colored gentleman. I'm telling you Harry is nothing but evil. I'm warning you -- you can't keep a wild animal as a pet around children.
Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.
I'm sorry he got those birds.
I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful.
I planted a row just for you and you don't owe me anything.
Okay.
You can bring ONE toy...
Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!
Yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, Mom.
Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.
Rocky!  The ramp!
I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
Oh.  Oh, that's good.
My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use your karate chop action!
Shhh!
Don't you get it?!  You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!! 
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
Why would Andy want you?!  Look at you!  You're a Buzz Lightyear.  Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you.  You've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that -- that whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy.
We've got to get out of here...NOW.
Woody!  The rocket!
This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
She's lying!  Whatever she says it's not true!
Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!
Will you quit moving around?!
I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
Nothing.
Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced.  This is Andy we're talking about.
I thought he was at summer camp!
So did I tell ya?  Huh?  Nothing to worry about.
Juvenile intrusion!  Repeat! Resume your positions NOW!

There's not.
You're spoiling your pretty looks. Come here.
Living with him put years on me.
You did what?
Finn ...
I know for a fact he didn't take Jonathon. Jonathon went off by himself.
H'm?
Did you now.
All the time.
Juliet who?
In the play. She was married, by my age. And Mummy. Mummy wasn't much older than me when she got married. Well, not <i>that</i> much older.
Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally.
No, of course not.  She's one of the top students at her school.
He's not here.
Why are you talking like that?
How much do I pay him?
Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying.  There's too much heat on Carl.
What?
It's so frustrating.
Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.
We don't want to push her away. These are growing experiences.
So's the video camera.
That makes mom the Czarina.  I'm a Czarette.  Like Anastasia.
Tell me what to do, Carl.  I need guidance, not a fucking platitude.  I'm not bringing a child into the kind of life I grew up with.  I won't do it.  I want our life back.
Will we get invited to the White House?
I don't know.
Sixteen
Live with your parents?
Parents still together?
You do?  What else you do?
Have you done your homework, honey?
It's a funny fuckin' joke and it's quick.  Why do women wear makeup and perfume?
She ain't in on it.
I have a job for you and I don't have much time.
So go shower already.
No, this is not possible.  And I thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it's been a pointless journey.
Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?
Yeah.  It should be fun.  You wanna come?
Porfirio Madrigal is not dead.  I just saw him.
That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
Any way we can do it better?
Sure.  More money in intelligence on their side of the border.  So we have a better idea who we're looking for.  More dogs.  More people. Supposed to be getting some giant x- ray machines to run the trucks through.  Outside of martial law that's about the best you're gonna do.  But, I should tell you, there are two things that really have us on edge right now.  In the last six months seizures have tripled, even though we're pulling over the same number of cars.  What does that tell you?
You won't say anything to my parents?
Hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem.
Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand?  What is your policy for treating addiction?
No. On you go.
Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.
I've no fucking cigarettes.
Thanks.
I'll come back if you like, but I'm not promising anything.
Well, what's wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue.
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.
Eh? How's that?
Oh, yes, indeed. I look back on my time there with great fondness and affection. The debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather --
The pleasure was mine. Best interview I've ever been to. Thanks.
It's no problem.
Spud, they're my sheets.
No. Me Neither.
I'm sorry, Tommy.
Well, sub us, then, mate. I'm expecting a rent cheque.
Yeah.
Exactly.
You can look it up.
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
Give me the gun.
He made me lick it.
God, you're sick.
I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it here.'  Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?
Fuck you.
Why would I want to sell my passport?
How much?
We're two thousand short.
Sure.
The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.
It will be. It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack.
Such as sitting in a darkened room, watching videos, drinking, smoking dope and wanking. Does that answer your question?
Six weeks.
It's a nightmare. She told me she didn't want our relationship to start on a physical basis as that is how it would be principally defined from then on in.
What?
No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --
Don't worry, fellas. Your secret's` safe with me. I'll send the shuttlecraft to pick you up.
Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
Oh, please.
Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.
What do you know of my pain?
Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
If we could send a distress signal...
Because it's there.
That's great. I haven't sung around a campfire since I was a boy in Iowa. What are we going to sing? What... Bones, what are we going to sing?
General Korrd's military strategies were required learning when I was a cadet at the Academy. When they put me out to pasture, I hope I fare better than Korrd.
I cannot be certain.
We don't have 1.2 hours.
Be one with the horse.
An eternity during which we'll be vulnerable to Klingon attack. Korrd-you tell him.
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
I did not.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
That's a little vague, Spock -
Hmmm?
James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.
Now learn something about yourself.
Given to me by God.  He waits for us on the other side.
You are mad!


And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
No. You must kill me.
Sybok, we must find a way...
No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.
Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..
Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access...
Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...
Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.
No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
Not a chance.
So... Nice ship you got here. What's our next move?
Yes.  It felt like Flynn.
I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.
End of line.
It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...
The Pentagon?
What do you want with the Pentagon?
If you think -
So do as I tell you. Keep that Tron program out of the system. And get me those Chinese language program I asked for.
That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right --
User requests are what computers are for.
Oh, you want to -- hah. I could get myself de-rezzed just-for letting you in here. They hate this tower. They'd close it down if they dared to but they keep me around, in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while. And you should hear the way they commune! Sounds like they were routing a payroll, for all the heart they put in it. No, I don't think you
You know anybody that's got an army for rent, that's fine...but my, uh, User said to go take that sucker out. An' let's face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any weaker. I feel like hittin' him now, while I'm good an' mad. Some nerve... what does he care whether you guys get killed, long as he keeps rakin' in quarters?
Well -- that's how it is for programs, yes, but --
Yes.
A little ...  Over there, the Mountains of Data... and I think that's the Silicon Valley...
Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of stuff. Like...my User wants me to go after the MCP
Well...my home "sector" was called Paramus ...
Good luck. You can't even think in here.
Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running...
Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together!  Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece
End of line.
Another free program off line.  What's his User s'posed to do -- ?
Oh, Tron... I knew you'd escape... they've never built circuit that could hold you...
It's something Users do.
Where's Flynn?
It is true!  He doesn't know anything about me.  He still thinks I'm like ten years old or something.  As long as I just smile and say yes to whatever he says, like his good little fantasy daughter, he thinks everything's fine.  But it's not fine.  Nothing's fine.
Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
Yeah, right.
Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
Unbelievable!  Trent told me he wrote it.  He's history.
Uh huh.  Right here in river city.
Roger, One.  Rolling.
So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!
What?
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
Got it.  Nice touch.  Okay, pick me up at eight.  The de-brief is at ten hundred.
Uh huh.  Want me to lose them?
Goddammit!  That's outrageous.
I'm giving her an assignment.  I am offerring you a choice.  If you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life.  If not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone.  Your like will be destroyed.
Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They needed some documents down at the court house.  I barely made it.
You're in a lot of trouble, Mrs. Tasker, so I suggest you cooperate.  If we want to know the most intimate details of your life, you'd better tell us.
What?  Oh, the flat tire?  Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.
I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
Isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run?
Dickless.  If they took care of				* business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean?
Get going! 
Fuck you.
The same place.  One o'clock.  I have to go now.  See you tomorrow.  Remember, I need you.
Cairo was a day at the beach next				* to this.
Something came over me, I just had nail him, no matter what the				* risk.  It was pretty hairy.  I thought he had me, a couple of					* times.  But I really can't take credit .  .  .
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--
I just glances inside.
What letter?
Yeah, my room-mate leaves it on the TV.
He wants to speak with you.
The letter he sent.
Get it.
And here we are.
The oriental.
He ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker. Sonny don't be bullshittin'. He fucks dudes up for life. Hold on, a fight scene's coming up.
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
I took a cab.
What do you do?
What kinda music do you like?
What are your turn-ons?
I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.
I'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what I'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most of the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.
You're not stupid. Just wrong.
Who?
Is he black?
Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.
You better not be fuckin' teasin' me.
Well, that's the one that explains how Jimmy Wang Yu became the Incredible One-Armed Boxer.
Bottom of the ninth . Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you seen your lovely wife today?
You don't know him -
Yeah.
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".
I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
That's why it doesn't come across as ass-kissin', because it's genuine, and he can see that.
Tomorrow.
Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.
Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're married. You killed a guy.
Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a fuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he deserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit badge or somethin'.
Three kung fu movies.
Want an animal cracker?
Mr. Donowitz?  I told you, through Dick.  He's in my acting class.  About a year.  Yeah, he's good.  They grew up together.  Sure thing.
I wanna be able to announce this deal at Cannes. If I had time for a courtship, Lee, I would. I'd take ya out, I'd hold your hand, I'd kiss you on the cheek at the door. But, I'm not in that position. I need to know if we're in bed together, or not. If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have to come to terms with your Fear and Desire.
I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
I really don't know.
Daddy, I'm in big fuckin' trouble and I really need your help.
I'm your son.
No shit?
Who is he?
Naw, until they hear something better they'll assume Drexl and Blue Lou had a falling out. So, once you leave twon, I wouldn't worry about it.
You know I read a lot. Especially things that have to do with history. I find that shit fascinating. In fact, I don't know if you know this or not, Sicilians were spawned by niggers.
Shit, are you behind. Me and Robin got a divorce six months ago. Got myself a new place - mirrors all over the bedroom, ceiling fans above the bed. Guy'd have to look as ugly as King Kong not to get laid in this place. I'm serious, a guy'd have to look like a gorilla.
Where'd you come from?
But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -
'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right anymore -
So you gotta get him to admit on tape that he's buying this coke.
Rock whores.
Pussy love pink rocks.
Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say "Bitch, suck my dick!" and then Jayne Kennedy says, "First things first, nigger, I ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!" Now, what do you say?
No way, Jos.
Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.
Sorta room-mates?
No.
Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?
So that...???
I need to go now.
I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you.  And I want you to trust me.  Can you do that, James?  May I call you "James"?
I need to go.
No, 1995 is the past.
No.  That's the reason they chose me -- I remember things.
Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
Everybody's got a gun.  In this city...
What?
The gun! ... I lost it
James, you said he was hiding in the barn...
IT WASN'T A TV SHOW!  IT WAS REAL!
If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now.
A telephone call?  That's communication with the outside world!  Doctor's discretion.  Hey, if alla these nuts could just make phone calls, it could spread.  Insanity oozing through telephone cables, oozing into the ears of all those poor sane people, infecting them!  Whackos everywhere!  A plague of madness.  In fact, very few of us here are actually mentally ill.  I'm not saying you're not mentally ill, for all I know you're crazy as a loon.  But that's not why you're here.  Why you're here is because of the system, because of the economy.  There's the TV.  It's all right there. Commercials.  We are not productive anymore, they don't need us to make things anymore, it's all automated.  What are we for then?  We're consumers.  Okay, buy a lot of stuff, you're a good citizen. But if you don't buy a lot of stuff, you know what?  You're mentally ill! That's a fact!  If you don't buy things...toilet paper, new cars, computerized blenders, electrically operated sexual devices...  SCREWDRIVERS WITH MINIATURE BUILT-IN RADAR DEVICES, STEREO SYSTEMS WITH BRAIN IMPLANTED HEADPHONES, VOICE- ACTIVATED COMPUTERS, AND...
I've managed to contact certain underlings, evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and assorted minions, who will contact my father. When he learns I'm in this kind of place, he'll have them transfer me to one of those classy joints where they treat you...properly. LIKE A GUEST!  LIKE A PERSON!  SHEETS! TOWELS!  LIKE A BIG HOTEL WITH GREAT DRUGS FOR THE NUT CASE LUNATIC MANIAC DEVILS...
A lawsuit?  You going to sue them?
Pulling out the tooth, man, that was nuts!  Here, take this.
The phone call, man.  The phone call.
The call I just made?  Five minutes ago?
It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
I said it was bad judgment!  What else do you want me to say?
Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do?  I don't have to tell you I'm afraid.
Your psychiatrist?  Did you just say, "your psychiatrist"?
Negative for drugs.  But he took on five cops like he was dusted to the eyeballs.  No drugs.  You believe that?
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
That a fact?
Or maybe you just think you do.  You can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.
What do you want for free?
I won't hold my breath.
But, in particular?
One way, or round trip?
Thirty even.
The ticket is thirty dollars.
Nope.  Darrell.
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
But he's dead.
Look, pal, I've got places to be. Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
What?
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.
Yeah, you better remember that.
Kirin?
Yeah, I'll try.
John--
I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
My name is John.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways.  I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
That a fact?
Good luck it didn't happen a few miles back.  Maybe they never would have found you.  Day like today you'd be dead for sure.
Yeah, my luck.  I get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert.
And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
Somewhere else.  I've never been anywhere else.  Just once.  Years ago.  Went to the state fair.  It was nice, but it wasn't nothing.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
Come here.
Depends on what you call love.  When I was growing up I had nothing.  I learned to want everything.  I wanted more than Sierra anyway. Jake was my ticket.  He's not much; he's older than me, different than me, but he's got more money than half this town put together.  I courted him.  I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line.  I wanted him.  I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him.  Is that love?
Whatever it takes.
Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
Lied?  What do you mean?
I . . . nothing.  Just something he said.  So if the money's in a safe we'd have to get the combination--
Kill someone.  I can't do it.
Are you sure?  About me, I mean?
Never needed one.  I've never been anywhere.  I've got a backpack.
He can't prove anything, John.  He can't turn us in.
You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?
Now what?
But you said we could be together.
<u>We</u> killed Jake.  And it's a big difference.  You kill an old man, that's one thing.  Nobody cares about an old man.  You kill a cop and they never stop looking for you. Never.
I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
Grace, listen to me.  In the trunk of my car is a rope.  It should reach down here.  Got get it, throw it down and I'll climb up.
What for?
Fuck you!  Do you hear me, John!? Fuck you!  John . . . John!?
I . . I was helping your wife.  I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were.  I can tell you got a temper on you.
How do you know if you've never tried?
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
What makes you say that?
Just to get out of here?  That doesn't seem much for a murder.
What should I do?
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
And tell her what?
I hate loving her.  I hate the kind of her person she is.  I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise.  And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  But you?  You got the killing in you, boy.
Came close this time and it scares you.
SHUT UP!
Thirteen-thousand dollars.  Had you done it.  Isn't that what we agreed on?
No.
Nothing happened with me and Grace this morning.
Is that what happened?  Did you even make it out to the desert, or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets?
I said come on!
I wanna play a song on the juke. You got a quarter?
Got any requests?
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
For what?
For defending my honor this afternoon.
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
Oh, shit!
Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
Give it to me!
What happened?
Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush.
Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra.  What with that ruckus you had with Toby.  Oh yes, I heard all about that.
Sheriff, he didn't give me any choice.  If I hadn't defended myself- -
I didn't do anything.
Christ no!
I said I was sorry.
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
I got things to do.
I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.
Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.
Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself: is it worth it? Day comes Earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart! Then you better know what it is you're doing. <u>Are you a human being</u> -- or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin' around?
You know I won't be seeing you.
You expect me to believe that?
What?  You want to fight?  Over her?
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.
Fine.  I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
My honor, that's what I'm fighting over. Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?
I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
Darrell's a moron.
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
Would you kill her?
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
I'm not rambling.
I need thirteen.
And tell her what?
You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
Got any requests?
Cause she's dead.
How old are you?
Will you shut up!
Yep.
OK. Darrell... Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.
Bottom hose was shot too.  Rotted clear through. Had to put a new one in. Runs like a dream now.
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.
What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
You believe that?
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
No charge.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
I got it.
Accident.
And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .
I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
I guess it must.
Where'd you learn to do that?
At night. He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. I heard him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. Maybe more.
Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of-a-bitch.
It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to <u>feel</u> it...  I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
I could if I had Jake's money.
I don't give a damn about the money.  I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this for you.  I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
No! You get it!
I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.
We're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go.
He was a scumbag!... He wanted <u>me</u>, Bobby. These guys don't let go! Even when they're <u>dead</u>...  You don't know what it was like, Bobby. Those two, they were the same.
<u>I don't know why</u>!
Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.
Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
Harlin's.
No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
The old lady?
With a <u>shotgun</u>!  She kills <u>both</u> of 'em, and... and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces. Not one bill is left alive.  I mean, what are the odds?
Which you don't have.
The ticket is 30.55.
No Beck's. A-1, Coors...
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl!
No! No! Please!
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of. I ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ...
I said come on!
No sir he is not.  I read about you in the paper.
I'll keep it in my office room.
I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
Oh shit...
You use your sleeve.
He's dealing with a lot of things.  I think he needs to find answers himself.
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
My turn.  When was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it?
Seventy-five percent? That's not nearly good enough for me. I'm extremely skeptical.
Skeptical about what?
Your answer to my question. It's one thing to have never been injured in your life, but to state that you've never taken ill, well that's a whole new level.
Technically no. I gambled that you would attend the church service. I just waited for you.
We are.
He's kind of a miracle.
Consider him packed. I didn't like his attitude... Struttin around with a cane and shit.
I think it's be better if I was alone.
How about your room then? If you get scared like before, you can come back in here?
No.
What if you only ate foods that were good for you and you worked out everyday for a year?
All of it.
There's no more left?
That's great.
Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave! I'm going to go to New York.
It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.
How long have you been married?
What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife...
He give 'em names?
Three days? I must be.
Oh. Yeah.
Me? No. No, I guess not.
I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.
Uh... yeah. Yeah. She's uh... watchin' over the little ones.
Shit and fried eggs.
WW Beauchamp... Little Bill Daggett and... "friends."
Be careful with those, sonny.
Porch. I'm puttin' a porch on her so's I can puff my pipe of an evening an' drink my coffee an' watch the sun set.
All week?
Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
You could run off them two cowboys.
Uh, William... uh... Hendershot.
N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...
A book, huh?  I guess that means you can read... An' I guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms... But then, like you told old Andy there, you ain't armed, are you, Bob?
Duke.
What?
No he ain't. He went South yesterday.
Nobody didn't kill Ned, he went South yesterday. He didn't even kill nobody. Why would anybody kill Ned?
Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
He hanged him?  Shot him down?
Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
Oh.
Huh?
Been gone near three years now.
He's clear of the horse, Ned. Better get him.
Maybe, maybe not. Got him in the gut, I think.
Yup.
Yup.
You better get on back, Miss.
Stay clear of folks you might see. There's plenty out lookin' to hang you. Go on now, skedaddle.
We'll come across him tomorra, I guess.
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
You ain't like that no more.
Hell, no. I'm just a fella now. Ain't no different from anyone else no more.
He hit you?
Kid? The Kid's shootin at us?
You still think it'll be easy shootin' them cowboys?
He's dead, Bill.
Listen, Bill, I'm gonna see what's takin' The Kid so long. Must be he's gettin' an advance offa them sportin' ladies.
Naw, son, I didn't kill nobody.
We'll bury him.
I can't spot 'em myself but you could. That red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, I bet.
Hell, yeah.
What was the money for?
Time for what, Edie? Time to look into me a little more, that's what. No matter how well you cover my tracks now, they'll find out who I am.
Dean, I love you. Do you hear me?
A glass of water would be nice.
Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
I don't know. This is bad.
They fucking know everything.
You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
What's with you? What do you care whether I come or not?
You okay?
I'11 be alright.
Well, I'm sorry.
They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you.
Russian, I think. I don't know.
You know damn well, dead-man.
Hey, that was your mistake, not mine. Did you ever think to ask me? I've been
I work for Keyser Sate.
You know damn well what I think.
You know Ruby is in Attica?
You wanted to know what happened after the line-up, I'm telling you.
Sure. And I'm supposed to believe that hitting the Taxi Service wasn't his idea
The D.A. gave me immunity.
Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.
I never heard of him.
But how - wait. You're saying SOZE sent                  t us to kill someone?
Why did he want you to live? A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple? No, sir. Why'
Keaton was Keyser Soze
NO.
He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die.
You know what it's like, Agent Kujan, to know you'll never be good? Not good like you. You got good all fucked around. I mean a stand up guy. I grew up knowing I was never going to be good at anything 'cause I was a cripple. Shit, I wasn't
Immunity.
Then prosecute. I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy. I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged &quot;faceless people in City Hall&quot; you mention.
Abrams.  Yes.  How are you today?
Ah.  How did they treat you?
Very good.
No -- we don't want this case in court.
So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me.
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount.  Two Hundred Ten Thousand.  That would mean I keep seventy.
Don't equivocate.  Be positive. Just tell the truth.
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
Just as you are, Sir...
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
I wouldn't do it.
Now.  I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?
I...
You know these doctors could have settled out of court.  They wanted a trial.  They wanted to clear their names.
I'm going to win this case...Mist...Mr. Doneghy...I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
You guys, you guys, you're all the same.  The Doctors at the hospital, you...it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's `We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...'  And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
...What difference would...
I'm afraid that's not true.   Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
Yes?  Galvin, right?
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
Okay.  I'll meet you here.  Tuesday night ... I gotta go.  You going my way?
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no  question of that.  It's just a matter of how big...
You know what happened.
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
Then why don't you testify?
You know, you're pushy, fella...
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
That happens.
This is Miss Costello...?
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
Missus...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
I changed my life today.  What did you do?
What Hotel are you staying at?
Oh, yes, I do, Joe.  Believe me. You say you're going to lose.  Is it my fault?  Listen!  The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
It's over!
What are you going to do?
...I have to stand up for her...
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
Mary Rooney.  She won't talk to me.  I tried her at the hospital. I'm going to try her back at home. Read this.
They still have to take it to a jury.
D'you meet with Dr. Gruber...?
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital.  She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
I think we tried that.  The case is over.
The broad has disappeared...
The Hospital...?
...you need some old forms that she had...somebody's dying...
... I'm sure you do ...
I don't want to leave her.  Dick ...the, the ... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will ...
My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
... and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field ... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent ...
Mrs...
What did she say?
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
Yes.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
Yes.
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Why did it take that long to get her heartbeat...
No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background.
Ah? That complicates the problem.
If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?
I'm not making it up. I wouldn't know how. She'll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don't know. I call to her and she doesn't hear. And then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and doesn't know she's been away... can't tell me where... or why...
Oh, yes. You noticed the way she does her hair.
But she doesn't know, about her background.  She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.
You.
You're not far wrong.
Well... you don't look very much like Jack the Ripper...
Your name. And --
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
Why?  Because I remind you of someone?  That's not very complimentary.  And nothing would... happen...
No.
Honest?
I want to! Come on!
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
You can.
Is that the best you can do?
Can't you see?
I need you.
Dead. He'd broken her neck.
I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --
Do you remember where you were?
Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.
No birds live here.
A grave...
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
What else?
No!
Yes --
Valdes. Miss Valdes.  It's Spanish, you know.
What car?
It wasn't your fault.
Johnny, the doctors explained --
Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight. 
I think I can lick it.
That!?!
Pop Leibel.
Out. I've got things to do.
And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!
Naturally.
We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.
You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends.
The hell you do.
Go home!
You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries.
Calling the ambulance.
You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!
Yes sir, there sure is an option here. There are always options.
I'm calling the police.
We can do this. We can get her out of here.
We've already done this.
According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace.
Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
I can't do this.
She's here. She's just...Hold on a second.
The groom?
Well, I didn't mean it.
What's insane is the fact that Micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. That's insane.
I think we should say some words over the grave.
Boyd...What have we done?
What is the question you asked me?
I said, what have we done?
Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?
Now?
I'm getting really tired of your bullshit.
I'm serious.
The hell I did!
I never heard that.
And what happens when you can't?
New king.
Easy Micheal.
Come on tough guy. Listen to me.  You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me?
I do.
I don't think so.
Photographer?
What else have you forgot?
Well it's bad timing.
I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself.
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
What does Moore have to do with your growing?
You expect more what?
Honey I don't have the time...
Hey. It's me.
Okay.
Talk what out? We are locked and loaded here. We are non-refundable. I've got relatives on the airport right now! I've got...
Yeah. You.
What?
Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
You fucked a prostitute?
But...
No buts. I've waited twenty-seven years, twenty-seven years I have focused and prepared to walk down that aisle. I will not be derailed! I will not be embarrassed! I will not be denied! I am walking down that aisle tomorrow come hell or high fucking water!
Move the bodies.
You and Moore move the bodies and bury Boyd with them. In fact, put Moore in the ground too.
I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, "My son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me...My boy is just like me." Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me.
What does that mean?
Have another drink.
Maybe go up to the North Pole, the Arctic. Tag polar bears with dart guns. I've always had a pretty good aim...
Downstairs in the closet.
That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all our money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn." Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. Not one dog ate Pup Corn. Not one. Three months later, "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. My father never got over it. Never.
I kind of like "till death do us part." I mean, this is forever. In sickness and in health, through good times and bad. Honey, what do you think?
You know,  Darling you...you send me...Darling you ...You mend me.  Honey, sing it for Judge Tower.
A mutant species.
Drum banging real times.
Fish, I'm really sorry. I just...I owe you man.  Desert.
I don't think that's a good idea.
No, the children sleep with me.
What about them?
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
Don't worry. He won't be forgotten.
Today I can refuse you nothing.
It's my fault. If I'd come to see you more often, if I'd invited you here for holidays, maybe everything would be different.
Don't go!
You must listen to me before you go.
You disgust me... even if what you say is true.
Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
Good.
Do you have great devotion for the Virgin?
It's Viridiana. She's getting on my nerves.
Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
I think I'd better go tomorrow.
Why?
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer.
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
Why?
They told me it isn't at the hospital.
Stop this!
Where?
Come with me.
They shut all right now. And the blankets are ready.
Yes, yes, I saw you!
It's very wicked to spy. Why did you do it?
Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
Fine  you want to stay here?
Captain, I'm afraid of how smart Sid 6.7 is.  But I'm even more afraid of what's he's becoming.
Not from in here.
It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter.  Did you find out where the bomb is?
Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...
You know how much man power you're talking about?
Don't forget, convict, if this psycho isn't stopped, you go right back to rotting in a prison cell.
I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it  I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.
Go to hell.
What you need is a collar.
... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977.
He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite.
Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
Relax. I know what you meant.
You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?
...I think so...You?
I couldn't tell you.
Duck!
You won't want to watch. Turn around.
It's the White House.
They got the guys on a <u>retainer</u>, it's cheaper, <u>pay</u>'em, but don't lettem touch it... Let'em leave us alone.
Can we have a white one, please...
Izzat the thing...
...and...
What happens if he doesn't have his medication?
Oh, Lord....
Well.  Alright.  What is it?  What's, he, uh...?  He had an Illegal Immigrant, was his Gardener, some years back...?  What's the thing?  You people get ahead, you sure get nervous.
All I need is the one day.
Lookit, don't worry about it.  It's not a New Concept. Wake me when we touch down, will...
We can't <u>afford</u> a war.
...but...
What did they find out about the Gulf War?  One shot: one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been made of <u>Legos</u>.
<u>Who</u>?
Your guy gets four more years in Washington...  ...it's only Nine More Days.
I <u>live</u> for midnight, when I can tear another of those suckers off.  Watcha got for me?
Big Bird touches down <u>when</u>?
Get on this, right now...
<u>So</u> forth...
I'm doing my job, Too.  Would you give me a... do you think you could call off your Dogs for a minute.
What are we gonna <u>do</u> about it...?
And I take this <u>opportunity</u> to suggest that, equally, I admit to <u>nothing</u>, and that I would like my lawyer present.
Guess what?  We show, and N.S.A. confirms, there <u>are</u> no nuclear devices on the Canadian border.  There are no nuclear devices in Albania.  Z'at put us in something of a pickle?  Albania <u>has</u> no nuclear capacity.  Our spy satellites show "no secret terrorist camps" in The Albanian Hinterland.  The F.B.I. and the Border Patrol, And the R.C.M.P. report no repeat no untoward activity along our picturesque Canadian Border.  The Albanian Government is screaming its innocence, the world is listening.  There is no War.
Where's my pill...?
...we own it?
ON BREAN, WHO IS DOODLING.
Does it <u>have</u> to be Albania?  Because, lookit:  I can get my hands on a lot of walking-around-cash, I think, if it's <u>Italy</u>...Look at the tie-in here:  <u>The</u> <u>Boot</u>, "Givvem the <u>Boot</u>,"... If we were to go Wide with a <u>shoe</u> as the fad.  A "Shoe-fad"...  Here's what it offers us...
Well, let's not be too sure, why is that?
I'm interested in the Security of My Country, Mr. Brean.
Why do they go to War?
...Yes.
Where'd you go to school, Kid.  Wellesly?
Dartmouth
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
And, to hold it together, I need two days.  There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber:  here's what you do ahout that:  whoever is leaking stuff to that geek at the Post, lets it slip, "Geez, I hope this doesn't screw up the B-2 Program..." "What B-2 Program, and why should it screw it up?"  "If the president moves to deploy the B-2 before it is fully tested."  "Deploy the B-2, <u>Why</u>?"  "In the Crisis."
Yeah, hut you can't hold the dam.  How the hell, n'nu'n', I don't get what you want <u>me</u> to ...
How you going to stretch it?  This won't hold for eleven days.  Guy fucked a twelve- year-old...whadday're gonna do to hold that off?
Uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u>, uh...  You're kidding.
Uh, it's a slogan.  From, uh...
Remember the Maine...
Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too!
Is that true?
How the fuck do <u>we</u> know.  You take my point?
Hey, I know that, hey, I'm <u>kidding</u>...  "It's a pageant"
We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.
Yeah...?
They got him standing by.
Oh, you're gonna love this:
If they can give Kissenger the Peace Prize, I wouldn't be surprised to wake up and find I'd won the Preakness.
Big mistake.
We <u>were</u> the Albanian campaign, John -- <u>We Were There</u>.
Yes, William, Uh, we have this <u>thing</u> we're doing...
Get on your feet, boy.
We'll deal with that when we come to it.  <u>This</u> is producing.  <u>This</u> is what they pay off on...come on, Pal, Boots and Saddles...
Deal's changed.
Let's take the bridge from <u>nine</u>, and the intro from <u>one</u>, and...
What guards Us Against Canada...?
Where are we on the Image?  Grace?  <u>Grace</u>...
They look stupid.
Leopard Skin...
Better.
...this is nothing.  This is nothing. D'you ever shoot in <u>Italy</u>?  Try three Italian starlets on Benzedrine, this is a walk in the park...
He's not dead, Ronnie.  He's just a little understandab1y, <u>fatigued</u>.  Let's get him to some help...
...gimme some help...
Of course, we're gonna need some <u>water</u>, uh...
Is it a <u>stream</u>, or is it a...
Sounds tempting. I prefer mine with a twist of fate. You know like us meeting. Don't go away...
Marv,  ...I just bagged the elephant!
Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus.  Jesus Christ, what are friends for?
Lynch is giving him the boot... He's not pulling his quota.
Now! Tell everyone to dump!
Speak English will ya.
you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now, 'stead of going off and bein' a salesman.
You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money, right? You're a salesman.
Not in here Dad... please. Later.
About what?
Sure I'm sure. Buddy, you got that mischievous look in your eyes. You used to smile just like that when you were a baby sleeping, just like that.
Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...
What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet.
That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim.
I guess it's time to hit the road.
What'd you tell him?
You sure?
Good. Then call him back. And call me back. Don't worry.
Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?
Yeah, right...
All right, Bud... let's do it.
...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
...going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal.
Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.
So whatta you got for me, sport? Why are you here?
A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities...
...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
Nice to see you again Mr. Gekko.
The most valuable commodity I know of is information. Wouldn't you agree on that?
Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it?
What about it? You work hard. I'll bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought. And where'd it get you?... my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies. And he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house; my mom ended up working in a dish factory... Wake up pal, if you're not inside you're outside. And I'm not talking a $200,000 a year working Wall Street stiff flying first class and being "comfortable", I'm talking rich pal, rich enough to fly in your own jet, rich enough not to waste time, 50-100 million, a player Bud -- or nothing. You had what it takes to let through my door. Next question: You got what it takes to stay...??
Close to two million.  But this sucker can go all the way to Devon and the nationals.
I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.
Sure. What's worth doing is worth doing for money. It's a bad bargain where nobody gains. And if this deal goes through, we all gain.
I'm sorry, this can't wait.
How much is enough Gordon?
Dump it.
Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.
...are you going to trade all night again? You got to go to work in a couple of hours.
...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded...
So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy?
I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.
Why?
Can't blame me for trying. You look as beautiful as that painting I just bought.
You told him about us?
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
I can't...and I won't.
Ooh ooh, tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown-up package. Does this mean you're ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own? Because, Darien, if you're through with me, you're through with everything I'm a part of.
And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada.
We'll take our chances.  Nice to see you again, Mr. Gekko.
Yeah, yeah, OK
Yeah 
Right. CHINA I need a taking care of,  not `hey how bout a pizza after class babe'.  I'm looking  for something just a little more in a man.  A little `je nes se qua'.
China.  What happened? CHINA Shhh.  It's ok.  I missed you so much.
Are you sure you wouldn't like a closer look?
Thank you Jenkins
And uh, your nicotine sir
She went to a waxwork party
Can I give her a message?
Tony and China?
I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
Forget her Mark, she's a bitch
You guys are being real assholes
Come on Mark MARK Ah hell, why not.  I'll get the maid to write the essays
No, he wouldn't.
Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and...  Why is this so hard?
What does she look like?
That can't feel good.
No, it doesn't...Okay, look, I see what you're doing here, and that's, I'm sorry, but that's not it.  My marriage is fine. I've had some kind of "empty-nest" episode where I saw some things that weren't there.  Let's deal with that.  I'm willing to deal with that.  I just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist.
Everyone's very anxious to shake hands with our newest academic celebrity.
Wonderful.  It's good to see you two doing so well.
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
I couldn't catch my breath.  That's not a metaphor, that's...And I panicked.  I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there...  I tried to leave him.  Went to my mother's in Boston.  He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home.
I'd like to talk to you about Madison.
It's fine.
She never mentioned her father.
Well she wouldn't.  He left when she was twelve.  Never spoke about him after that.
We were suite mates.
Oh God...
You are?
So you'll have some later.  Notice anything...different?
You got it.
Seance.
Please.  That's all I need.
Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
I don't know.
Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.
Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
No.  She wanted me to know the truth.  Now that I do...I think she's at peace.
Did he say that?
Jody he was lying.
We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.
Norman Spencer.
Wanna fool around?
Mmm.
I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.
More or less.
Claire...
Is it gone?
Did you call the police?
I don't know.  Just...whispering.
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
You're kidding.
Wow.
Well, that's nice.
Norman, you are so funny about that.  No, I didn't.
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?
Harvey says he's amazing.
This is the Feur thing?
When she said it, there was something familiar...but no.
But I don't remember.
...Please stop...
It's Madison Fra--
Oh God...
What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
To Caitlin!!
We don't know that for sure.
Nothing.
I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health.  I'm the doctor.
There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.  what defines you in the landscape, Michael...?  what anchors your life...? Your work...?  Your creativity...?
NO!  she's pregnant, Aaron.  she's got that to deal with - and the clinic.. she is not to hear about this.   don't you think I know she spends half her lite worrying about me...  Listening to my heart, aren't you...?  The Timex still ticking...?
I don't want it.
I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did.   They made a deal with the devil.  Y'know - "make us rich" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'
I wish to speak to Ellie Mayfair.
But my mother...  Ellie said she died -
When is the funeral...?   I am coming to my mother's funeral!!
In the coffin, my dear.  where else...?
There are things I have to know!
...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
Always loved you..
It you harm Michael, I will let my anger loose.  And you will feel that. Do you understand...?
I LOVE him!
I love Michael...
That is what you must discover.   see what I am, my love. With all your power - see me, and know what I am.
It was an accident.   Gifford, too.
ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
Like this...  LIKE THIS...?
I'm glad you're around to say it.
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
God knows, I'm intriguing.

Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
Let's see.
So how come I love you most when you stick your finger in your chin...?
Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.
Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
As long as you get the HACKSAW piece done by FRIDAY... FRIDAY?
You know that circulation is down for three months in a row.
Well, if you could come sometime just before we close, then I could show you everything and  then we could go for a drink to discuss the finer points...
That's right...
No - I've been abroad for a long time...
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
Yes - I have had it for years.
I don't know...
I have something I have to show you...
Wonderful - like a great release - He was a malignant cancer and I had to remove him - the world is better without him
Tell me about your adopted MOTHER
I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...
There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea?
CRAP! - I wish I had taken a photo of your face when I gave some to that DETECTIVE - What's wrong ELLEN - you look pale - maybe you have been eating the wrong kind of foods lately - it could be food poisoning?
At 2.00...
Is LESLIE here?
I'd really like it if you would come round some time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say...
She smiles at everyone, Ted.  She's like a newborn with gas.
I defy any and all limits.
Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
Astronomical.
For a guy about to try his first Dom Perignon, you are extremely uptight.
And like every hamburger guy knows, when you get your one big chance at the good life, you abuse every second of it until they figure out you don't belong there and kick your sorry ass out.
I better go, Dad.
Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.
Give me those!
Brilliant!  Molly, give me all you've got.  For Merk.
Well. The prom's coming up.
I mean, what do you think?
Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
Maybe on the outside. But inside, deep down, I've always been dripping with special sauces.  Are you hungry?
Then you better get in the water, before you get burned.
We own a small family grocery store.
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
We love our lives just the way they are.
Don't you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family?
We miss our family.
Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.
Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?
They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy.
Whatever helps you cope.
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
...not the pit.
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
I understand.
My new bike.
You can have it, then. I'm not going back there.
Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer.
I meant biologically.
Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with.
Me?
You never know around here.
I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted.
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
To the best hiding place in the world.
Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.
Eventually you'll let go.
There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.
Amen to that.
Wearing them?  Or humping them?
I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word.
Yellow pages?
Mom. Believe me. I could buy all that AND the factories they came from.
Rules are rules.
Tipping?
Yeah.  Everything's cool.
I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second.
Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."
It was incredible. The light, the crowd, everything.
I'm just a messenger.
The Van Ryan family created Blue Bay. They built the school... Sandra Van Ryan calls up the board and says kiss my ass, they say, left, right, or in the middle.  You're gonna need some help on this one, Sam.  You're gonna need a lawyer, and he'd better be a good one.
Thanks.
We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer.  You want DNA, that can take weeks.
Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you?
Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.
There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house.  There's phones there.  I cruised the place, but I didn't see her. I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found.  I don't know... Maybe I should have called.  But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself.  I figured we'd just take it up on Monday, in the office.
Back to the land of grownups.
The job looks okay to us.  But look at it from his point of view.  The man's surrounded by wealth and privilege.  But for him... it's just a reminder of what should have been his.
You could say that.
Just check out the car.
You don't think Sam could've put it there?
Yeah.
You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls...
Hey, man, at least in study hail I could meditate.
A ride.  You want one?
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  Right?  And Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do shit.
I think we just need to get wasted.
Shit.
He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly. He could have gone out and gotten a job. Christ, he could've found another rich woman... He never had a problem tucking my friends when we were married.
Okay.  I want you to hear this too. We've got to be cool.  All of us. People think I'm rich, for Christ's sake.   I'm doing what rich guys do.  I'm spending my money.  It's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing.  Now don't let this cop fuck with your minds.
God, I've been calling you.
No little girl can ever make me come.
I just want my life back...
Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan.  Let me in.  Now.
Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?
That's right.  That was his name.
The one you bought at school.
Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.
No.
Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it.
I'm going to hit you.
It's a repeating steam cannon!
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
We oughta get a couple of those rockets.  Voom!  We're there before we left!
You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?
Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
Thank you.
Oh, I see, an easy plan!
My Lord, he was telling the truth!
I don't like to lose, either.
Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
A mistake?  To assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the Chattanooga River and single- handedly trapped Jackson's entire cavalry?  How is that a mistake?
That'll be all, boys.
Part of some speech they wrote for this trip I'm taking.
No, sir... just a businessman.
Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
Who were they?  What do they want with me?
For the moment.  But I fear not for long.  I'm of no use to him now.
You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.
They're coming.
You're not going to use it, are you?
Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!
Me?
Not today, Willow.
Waste magic on revenge?  You have much to learn, Willow...
He turned that monster into stone!
Can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, Raziel?
Good.  How long will it take?
Are you a warrior?
Of course!  I promise!
My help?  A great magician like you?  You don't need any help.
You?
The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.
Willow!
Want me to carry Elora?
She's a bird, Willow.
Watch it!
Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter.  She is all that matters.  Are you going to abandon her?
What a great son you are, Ranon.  I wish I could take you with me.  Now go to sleep...
We need your help.  To take this baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin- cess.
Kill him!
As below, so above.  You hold the univers, Willow, in your hand.
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
The limitless power of...
Me!
Why?
Me neither!
I changed her already!
Madmartigan.
Milking?
Cows. You know, cows?
Not used to hard work. That's what makes an appetite.
They're Amish.
English, Yankee. It's the same. My name is Daniel. Daniel Hochstetler.  You look plain, Book.  Very plain.
No pistol. Ever.
I won't. Now run.  Fast as you can!
Oh, he's good.
Yeah.
You might want to pass it along to Mac.
I've already got something worked out.  Be seeing you.
Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
I would not be too sure.
No.
She thinks you should get married and have children of your own. Instead of trying to be a father to hers. Except she thinks you're afraid of the responsibility.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
You'll be safe. You don't have to worry.
What?
Buttons are Hochmut.
Anything against zippers?
I'm going this morning.
What else can you do?
I'm sorry. I'm sure it is.
Aren't you? After today?
He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know  anybody who knows John  knows that's a goddamn lie!
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him 
Yes.
You are acting like one!
They don't have any shit.
Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal.  He's got a gun, hasn't he?
Dorothy!  Dorothy!  We're busy!
Yes.
If any!
Yes, sir.  So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
Yes, I'm all right.  Oh -- I fell in and -- and Zeke --
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
Oh, please give me back my dog!
Catch him, you fool!
Oh.  But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?
The Wizard of Oz?  Is he good or is he wicked?
No, I'm afraid I didn't.
Oh, now?
Why --
Aw, come, come, come --
Do you know any?  Oh, you mean the thing -- Yes, well, I -- I never do anything without consulting my crystal first. Let's....
Her -- her name is Emily.
Uh-huh.
Oh, no -- no!
But you couldn't have been, could you?
Oh - I'll get it!
Oh --
Not nobody, not nohow!
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.
It's pleasant down that way, too.
Ohh!
Um-hmm.
Where's Kansas?
But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
Oh --
Oh -- are you -- are you all right?
Dorothy next!
Don't you start it, too!
That's right.
Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?
Oh, scared, huh?
Hold still - hold still --
Not nohow!
B-B-B-B-B-But if we do that, we'll have to kill her to get it!
It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I get a heart of not.  Bee-hive -- bah!  Let her try and make a bee-hive out of me! You know -- Hmm? What's that?
A heart --
Hurry -- hurry --
Don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!
Yes -- how about Dorothy?
You promised us real things -- a real...
Dont know any doctor jokes.
She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now.  And Ms life is part of the bet.
The King pipeline.
If I dont get to the Boa before he gets to Maidens Tower, M is dead.
But what if...
I took the initiative.
You havent been given an assignment in this case.
Renard.
Hes not through yet. Renard doesnt blow up five million dollars unless he knows theres more coming in. Hes working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline.  And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you.
Theyre getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I cant help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...
Who did you get it from?
How long has he been with you?
Were alright.
...you should rest.
I dont want to be safe!
Shush.
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  A nice little rats nest.
What?  This is not possible.
I thought you were the one in her business.
No.  The truth!  She thought I was dead -- those blades were meant for you.  What do you know that she would kill you for?
Id heard there were some renovations there...no one would look for a sub in that place in a million years.
Could...could you come?
Your father...
How would you know?
The weather.  I see.  Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.
They want in.  Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
Hello, Adrian.
Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
Not yet, there's plenty of time.
Jon, no -- I can't --
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
Because --
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
Uh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked at Gila Flats.
And what if youre wrong?
Then Ive been a very bad boy and youll have to spank me.  Christ!  Im doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!
His . . . whatever.
Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial.
Okay!
Oh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No.
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
Those cars.  What year is this??
Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --
My dad's a watchmaker.  I'll put it back together for you.  Better than ever.
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
What is that ungodly smell?
Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
Looks like a diner.
That's too bad. I thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge.
If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.
Just remember, I'll be watching.
Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's what I'm thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac.
You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that "classified" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song "Silent Night" mean anything to you?
Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.
I think we should send him whatever he wants.
Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
You wanna check it out? Come here.
Kirill, the sniper. Looks like a bookworm, but he had 72 confirmed kills in Chechnya, they called him the "Finger of God". Assassination and weapons.
I have Japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet, if you have the quality of merchandise they're after. And it's a mil two, max.
Mind your business.
Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.
Viktor! Stay the course.
That's would be me.
They come in any other styles or colors?
I'm having fun, what's the problem?
I don't wanna go mersh, you know that. But hey, if this is about money...
Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
This is a gift. From me to you.
Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.
What's "Anarchy 99"?
My old man, he bought into the system, and it screwed him. So he swallowed a bullet. Me, I don't believe in nothing I can't see and touch.
Including rape, pillage, murder.
What are you talking about?
If Magneto is planning to use Logan for some terrible purpose it's our responsibility to do something.
Sure you are, sport.
Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
What do you say?
Not interested.
In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan.  We are the future... not them.  We must protect ourselves.  After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs.  This is survival, I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine?
And you think it helps calling her Rogue?
Is it enough?
Enough for a test.
And what do you do when you wake up to that?
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
Herr Falkstein -- you must go at once and present Dr. Frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance.  The estate will provide for your journey.
You have the wrong house.
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
What was your grandfather's name?
Poppycock!
Yes, sir.
All right then... seven's always been my lucky number.
Love me oodles and oodles?
You have your tickets?
Yes.
And your passport?
Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
Very....very!
Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye, darling!
I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am.  Oh!  These are my assistants:  Inga and Ayegor.
Darling, you mustn't worry so.
Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
That's my good boy.
I don't know what you mean, sir.
But, sir...
What wockers?
Go ahead, play dumb!  You'll lose your sockers and then be fockers.
I wonder what's got into them?
What are you doing here?
Can you imagine that brain in this body?
Why?
Yes.
I'm not trying to be funny.
Act casual!
What did you find out?
Someone was playing this in the music room.
Can you play it?
Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?
Okay, boss!  But I hope you know what you're doing.
...Su-per du-per. Come let's mix where Rock- e-fellers walk with sticks or 'um-ber- el-las' in their mitts.........................
It's an honor for me, sir.  You play the violin?
Ja, ja.
Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.
No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.
I think I'll...carry him.
Well...  ... perhaps for a few minutes.
Yes, I know.
...But an intellectual relationship, like this -- we could have as often as we wanted.  Three times a day -- anything!
Yes, sweetie...I heard you.  So! I'm ready for you, meine Liebe.
There must have been someone else down here then.
Whew!  A nineteen-inch drill.
Four

Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
