No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
You got something on your mind?
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Then that's all you had to say.
But
What good stuff?
The "real you".
No.
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
What's normal?
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
You did what?
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
Daddy, I --
Otherwise known as an orgy?
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
It's a lung cancer issue
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
What 're you talking about?
Do what?
You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
That's never been proven
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
You're not a big talker, are you?
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Unwelcome.
So what did I have an effect on ?
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
Yes
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
Oh huh
What?
It wasn't like that.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?
Which parts?
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
What plan?
Ever been to Club Skunk?
So you got cozy with she who stings?
He's the devil's child...
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
You don't usually ask.
My letters of appointment.
There'll be a time.
No...
You defend yourself admirably...
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
All I have to do is call the guards.
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Chief says -- how many?
You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!
Passion is something one cannot control!
I have to disagree.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
...delusions and paranoia.
No, he is here.  Shit...
What's your cut?  How much?
Your mother was blind?
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
I can't take you to my place.
I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
In the kitchen.
I don't want to drag you down with me.
I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
I let her take a shower.
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid kid.
The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.
He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.
Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.
What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid
Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...
What's your accomplishment.
Then do it, asshole.
Detective, does it look like a murder?
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
Stop it.
That's good.
What?  It doesn't work that way.
C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh, look, you're sweating.  You don't have the balls.
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
What?
Speak English!
Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!
Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
What was that?
No way!  He's mine!
You okay?
Yeah?  What kind?
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
Yeah?
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
CONTINUED
Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
Yes.
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
Well, don't worry about it.
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
Yes, very pleasant.
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Certainly.
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
What do you mean?
Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
Hal, have pod arms secure the component.
Roger.
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
I want to drive awhile.
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
How about it?
I hear you've got visitors.
No chance.
Where's ganz?
Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
You're crazy.
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
Hey, this works pretty good.
We eat when I say we eat.
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
You stay with me...
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
Which one pulled the trigger?
Doesn't look like it.
I got to wait for a call.
Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
A cop...
I'm all wet.
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
You sure you want me to?
Great place for lunch.
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
Hey, I don't believe it.
Can't complain.
When?
Give it back.
Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play.
...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
...would you like a drink?
You noticed...
She's an exception..
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
Leeloo... is... she's...
I just found a picture of you.
How many points you got left on your license?
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!
...Hello?
Other than that... You all right?
I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?
He's on vacation.
I don't even know what I'm looking for!
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
You hear that?
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
The wind blows... the fire burns...
I'm so tired...
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
Wait or act.
Recommendations.
A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am going to be famous.
Am I disturbing you?
...Not far, now.
Your clothing reeks of it.
How's the detective business?
I love you.
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
You should have.
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
I don't know what to say
Don't...
What the fuck... !
Is it?
We can do that.
What are these for?
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
I'm not so sure about this.
What the fuck are you.. ?
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
What do you want?
Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.
Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
Do it.
You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.
The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...
He's lying.
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
Not quite.
... Hello... ?
Where are your parents?
His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.
Specialty product.
I'm a working stiff, pops.
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
No.
I told you I can't, not yet.
I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...
For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
No.
So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
Will you let me look?
I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.
It's been six years.
Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.
Who is this... ?
They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
That obvious, huh?
No...
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.
How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
Feeling better now?
Excuse us, dear.
How did you know that?
No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
Dad!
You sure you don't want a ride to work?
I've got to go.
You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?
I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.
Then get out!
I don't understand.
Have another one, sounds like you need it.
Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.
What is it?
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
I don't know.
But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.
'Us?'
I don't hear anything.  Maybe you've been down here too long.  Why don't you go back up and -
A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!
Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
Excuse me, Skipper---
Something wrong?
Why do you say that?
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.
Why?
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.
How soon?
No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
He's on to us!
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
I'm okay.
The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er --
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
Yeah.
Open the door. We're late.
Yeah. It's stupid.
Jesus, why?
See, I knew you'd be mad.
Yes.
No.
You're a policeman.
I figured you already heard.
I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
What the fuck. My day's already ruined.  Give me the keys. You can go back with Jack. You still got a shitload of plowing to do.
Something bugging you?
On what you pay me?
Maybe.
Did you get his number?
Good. Who?
I'm sorry.
There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
Jack doesn't need money.
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
When did she die?
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
You talked to Jack?
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
Pop, for Christ's sake!
You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
Yeah.
Wade?
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
That it wasn't an accident.
I don't know. You tell me.
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
Some kids were teasing you?
Oooooh, I'm good.
Daddy...
How you doing, sweetie?
There they are!
Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.
Put your pilot on.
Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.
Dead.
Nine.
Who did this?
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
You're pointing a gun at me.
But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people.
She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.
The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.
Can't it wait?
Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.
What?
I miss you. And I miss her.
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
Where's my family?
One.
Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.
WE'RE HOOKED!
That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.
That just doesn't make any sense.
I was reading too.
Felt like a large asteroid.
Elaine.
It's got to be stopped!
Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.
That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
Not now, Elaine!
Elaine.
I'd use the word insane.
Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.
That's right -- premature ejection.
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.
I'm so excited, Simon.
I guess this is a first for you.
That's not possible.
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.
Request; life support systems check.
Can I hold him?
You folks need any help?
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
Striker.
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
You've been hurt.
I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
Both pilots!
Surely there must be something you can do.
A hospital? What is it?
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
I love you, Elaine.
Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.
Rain.
Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.
Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.
There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list.  Don't take it personally.
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
Lay off, asshole.
I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right?  Whatta you care?
Look, you want to fit in here, right?  You want to learn how to get along?
Did you learn anything?
Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?
Screw you.
From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.
Your health...
She's going to divorce me.
Please, I must get out here.
How potent?
Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
They had months in quarantine to develop the plan.  Porter, with his chemistry background, must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug.  Hubley manufactured it -- at the refinery.  Strader, through the nightclub, established a distribution network.  And Harcourt--
Shit!
Only holds five.
The human?
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?
Hope their plumbing's the same.
Does that look at all suspicious to you?
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
This floor's freezing.
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
And it's too late to shut it down?
She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.
Amy.
I get the picture.
They're right under the primary heat exchangers.
Corporal Hicks!?
I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.
All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
Sir?
Let's get the fuck out of here!
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
All right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest?
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
And how are we today?
Terrible.
I guess we're not leaving, right?
Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.
Don't go!  Please.
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe...
A Turkish brothel.
You might be disappointed.
Why?
The marriage!
Extremely clever.
Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to write another aria for you. Something even more amazing for the second act. I have to get some water. Her mother is lying on the stage.
Humiliated?
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
In the pot, I have got a good dinner. Not a sausage or stew, but a singer. Not a sausage or stew but a singer. Is the treat that I'll eat for my meat!
Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.
Do you think that's funny?
They'll come anyway. They love me here.
Oh yes? You always know everything.
What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
I don't know.
Why not?
Give me one reason I can understand.
How charming.  But why did he not come himself?
He's terribly busy, sir.
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
It is miraculous.
Alone.
What?
What are you doing here?
Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?
Leave him alone!
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
I see that you're expecting.
Hey!
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
Who was your teacher?
My pleasure.
Yes?
And the result satisfies.
What do you mean, Sire?
Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?
Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?
Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?
He's here.
I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming.
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
What's that?
Oh, let's not talk about it.
Not that I've seen.
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
Yes?
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
What?
Yes.
What for?
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?
Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!
No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!
Ah. Italian?
Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.
I think it's marvelous. Truly.
Mozart. It was good of you to come.
How could it not, Excellency?
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
Confutatis Maledictis.
The Fire.
Exactly.
Then why especially does it have to be in German?
That will do, Herr Mozart!
Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away.
What are you doing, Herr Director?
No, but I'm the best.
A little modesty would suit you better.
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
Leave me alone.
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
And do they believe it?
Do you believe it?
His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
Yes.
No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!
For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.
He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?
What exactly did he call out?
Mr. Kessler?
Please, really. I'm not hungry.
Call me David.
That's not really a very proper question.
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
What?
Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
Are you better now?
Your dead friend Jack?
Anything.
Werewolves simply do not exist.
I've left those pills for you.
No.
No what?
Oh, all right. There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York. It was full of men from the United Nations.
Some, everyone does.
Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins.
You're in a hospital in London.
You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
I really don't know.
Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.
Yes.
Jack.
Well, I like it here.
I don't know.
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!
That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.
I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
Yeah?
A coyote.
It's moving.
David! You're hurting my feelings.
David!
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
Shut up, you zombie!
I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
It's you, David.
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
No, thank you, Doctor.
You were saying?
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
Roger Mathison, Doctor.
Campari and soda would do nicely.
Do you have any hot soup?
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent.
What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.
No kidding?
Yes, sir.
What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years?  I'll tell you. Not a single one!  What's wrong with that kind of banking?
We want to talk to you.
What do you mean, help?
That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.
Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun.
For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .
But I'm giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, bells, whistles, and everything. I'm really terribly excited about it. I've been planning it for months.
Why are you so anxious?
What?
Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals—  I think I will have a drink.
Yes, sir.
Let me see your cash book, will you?
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.
Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night?
Good morning.
Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
Yes?
Looks good. How much did it cost?
You're protecting somebody.
But I haven't . . .
You're lying!
How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off.
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right.
He's at a board meeting.
I'm afraid so.
In Cluett's office?
Oh now, don't be silly.
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
Listen here, young man - nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it—
Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!
He's smiling.
Uhh, yeah it does.
What have you done?
Damn!
You have no shame.
"The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk."
This is about the "Wanted!" Posters, isn't it.
He's been full of vinegar lately.
What you sayin' boy?
How?
Ride with me, cousin?
So what do we do, General Lee?
I'll pick the first job! I mean... I know a girl down at the bank. See if she can't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money.
I got seven thousand.
This is your fault for hogging all the publicity.
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
Bob, rip up some bandages.
Tom, why don't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation? Figure we might have some work for you, if you want.
Both would be nice.
BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!
Jesse.
You know you're welcome any time!
He's going to be fine, right Daddy?
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
And we're good at it.
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
But he killed a lot of men, too.
Doc Mimms will --
Teasing you is completely unfair.
Where will you find such a girl?
I don't understand.
"Hmm" what?
Let me see that.
Don't swear.
Tennessee?
Did you order our houses burned down?
The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.
This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.
The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable.  "Jesse Woodson James." Jesse James? The Jesse James?
Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
Thank you.
You okay, Jesse?
Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
Thank you, Miss -- ?
Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.
Yes sir.
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish. 
This is Dorsia?
Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely.
Luis is a despicable twit.
It's a plain end, see? So?
I haven't seen you around here.
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
So, you're looking great, how have you been?
Yes, darling?
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.
Are you using minoxidil?
Your hairline looks like it's receding.
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
You're inhuman.
You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?
Like what?
Dorsia.
Want a bite?
Forget it.
What...No! Put it in the carton.
Jean-I'm not-
You think I'm dumb, don't you?
What do you mean, she was a hot number.
Paul Owen.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just walked in...  Just joking...  No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, right, got it.  Sorry about that.
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
Understandable.  Lime?
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
Well, maybe he did, huh?
Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and-
Uh, no. There's one...down here.
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball.  Call me Don.
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
Not in the mood, I guess.
Where was Marcus?
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work?
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
I can't...I can't find a shelter
It's...it's...all right.
Oh well, you know.
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?
I know, I know.
What're you -- what?
They hack into people's programs?
If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
Milo --
...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
My goodness.
It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
Is it your software?
What?!
That'd change with a criminal indictment.
Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?
And the kid who wrote Skywire -- then gave it away? They're calling him the digital Robin Hood.
...Hello?
Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
Cool!
The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges.
Could work with a new switch. There may be a few more things hidden.
Well -- you sent for me.
Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.
Wait... He knows.
Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time.
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
Why would you do a thing like --
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.
How close are you?
We can't just assume they're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch. I'd have to write in an aglet.
Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there.
She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.
Bring it to the other location.
Is that how Larry feels?
So how'd you like the house?
Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.
You seem surprised to see me.
You may.
I'd rather talk about Number Two.
That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.
Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence.  There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.
Yes?
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Yes?
Be careful.
Carnies.
My God, Austin, what have you done?
Be careful.
I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.
Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.
My mother's told me all about you.
How do you know?
I don't get it.
I'm sorry.
No, did you use a condom?
Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
Out and about, doing odds and sods.
Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.
I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
Shut up.
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is.  Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank.
No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming?
And how do you feel about that?
Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
Red ...
You
I'm afraid that's impossible.
This isn't a game.
What are you trying to do to me?
Peter Peel was a first class agent. A senior operative. 'X' department Special operations. He was engaged in top secret research. Top priority.  Government approved.
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
You killed my husband.
Too many cooks --
I'm already married ...
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
Much better.
I didn't. Mother did.
That place is so absurd, so out of date ...
Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
For you, Mrs. Peel.
That's what we were working on.
... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin?
Not that I know of.  Explanation?
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?
No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
What kept you?
Our chaperon.
Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete.
I see.
Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
Global warming?
Oh, hello ...
Both, actually.
Let it be rain, please let it be --
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.
Hey, you guys, what's going on?
You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together?
Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.
Not interested.
I love that car.
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
But how can I do that?
Cole, we've got to talk.
No, Cole, I...
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
Huh? Wha...
Remember, you promised... no screwing around.
Let's get naked.
Yeah.
Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
Great bathing suit.
Let's go.
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
I just want to be alone.
Ha, ha, ha.
I'd love that.
Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch.  Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?
You've been having strange sex...!
No, Brett, I...
What's the matter?
We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
Right in there, pal.
Who was that?
What's this?
Now, don't get into any trouble.
How about this, a Trojan donkey.
I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break.
Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book.
Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...
You stupid son of a bitch! What the fuck are you doing!
-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
Not likely.
It works.
People actually used to pay you for this?
Yeah? What about Laura --
I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?
Hey! You don't know me --
So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?
You look great.
Hey.
What'll you do?
-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.
Trychticholorate.
I want another shot, Sir.
Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
-- Shhh.
"Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"
"During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium".
Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless you could find something that would eat its residue.
Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes.
What?
That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?
'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?
That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant.
You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
What?
Well, if it isn't the littlest McCaffrey.  Hey! You break anything with that you buy it!  Sorry, there must be something wrong with my eyes. I keep thinking that's a fire department uniform.
Management were pin heads.
And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...
You can't talk about my brother like that...
He's got piano lessons.
I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --
Sorry I hit Jackson.
-- Burn them.
And old ladies?
I'm working on it.
Yeah.
First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that...  First time shooting up?
Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
I want 15 on the Mets.
How's the case going?
Yes, Sister?
You truly are a dancing fool.
Everybody say Ho!
Yeah!
There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you.  Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.
My own sister throwin' me out.  I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right.  Don't bother letting me out.
What do I do?
And another thing, you better stay away from my sister or you better...
You might be right.
No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
What's that?
Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.
Meaning?
Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.
No offense.
We was coming to see you.
DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!
I want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you don't mind.
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some "nigger" show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?
I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
Protest finally forced "Amos and Andy" off the air.  Could stop us from ever getting on.
And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity.  Make us feel good to be alive.
If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.
We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
What do you want?
It's been a long time.
Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.
It hit me like a ton of bricks.
How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.
Sounds risky to me.
This is the group I was telling you about.
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
Why'd you do that?
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
I'm happy for all of us.  It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.
Not nervous?  Relaxed?
You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost.  Don't you know you should never let them see you sweat.  Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
What you did is dead wrong.
Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
Not at all?
How did you get this gig?
Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.
Yes you!
A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
What do you mean?
To come back to our roots.
You tellin' the truth.
She hates dem.
Not for me, my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for...
...no, she didn't...
...yes she did.
I don't know who I am.
So what's up with you?
Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
You leave something out?
Just ask me what you want to know.
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.
And his baggage?
Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.
But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown.
Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
The coward!
Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife.
Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset.
Your honor must lower his voice.
Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?
To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.
I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.
A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.
Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?
Does this assignment interest you?
In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.
Then this must be done tomorrow.
Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  Have you lost much?
That fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me.
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
Good night, papa.
Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.
Gentlemen, see this amiable youth! He has been troubled by religious scruples, and has flown for refuge to my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has asked for advise from my wife, Lady Cosgrove, and between them both, they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith.  Did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple?
Sir, let those laugh that win.
Charming Schuvaloff.
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
He is only curious to know who you are.
If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
He loves me, as I love you.
You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
Fuck, what the fuck is going on --
You killed him you fucking faggot --
We got -- I don't know, we got separated
It's... too slow.
I just don't like it.
C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
He -- He made me do it --
And the bodies?
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?
No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?
You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too.
Sir, Dunbar, sir!
Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.
Why?
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
His chest was hamburger --
A test will no doubt link you to the killing --
But not the only victim, right?
I didn't kill him --
Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.
Somebody emptied a full clip into him --
How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
Is it the truth?
Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life --
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --
Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?
Where are they!
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
Nevertheless --
It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter.
You're a good soldier, Bill.
What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.
That's preposterous --
I'm not even going to dignify that --
Excuse me?
What is that?
That bugs you too?
They got their stories straight.
Are you sure?
You couldn't have known --
No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.
Think it'll work?
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
Fifty minutes.
Dunbar says you were.
Wrong answer --
I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished.
Sign here and here.  Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on that whole hulabaloo from last night?
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me?
I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
Who is she? Where does she live?
Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl.
I have to leave. Tonight.
I brought it.
No.
Yeah.
So I've heard.
I know.
Lucky girl.
Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.
You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
Did you do any of that?
You think I'm up for it?
I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.
What did he say?
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
You say...
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to...
You need to go.
I'm going with you.
You don't have to.
I talked with your father last night.
They met at Auburn.
Mmm.
Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
Was she one of your teachers?
Is he awake?
Did you and Dad have any other property?
Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff
That's not a burn.
A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby?
Hello.
Good. 
Right.
You're asking for my documents?
She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!
Tell me.
I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
Syevodnya?
What?
Give me some money.
Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
And. It's wrong.
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
Please, there's no... Oh.
I wasn't saying anything.
Are you scared?
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
I'm trying to quit.
I've got news for you. It's not working.
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
Okay. Thank you.
Whatever.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
Just wanted to see.
I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.
Hey.
You ain't the kicker, are you?
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
This don't feel right. Kitchen looks just like I left it. I know, cuz I cleaned it.
It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.
YOU SHUT UP!
Take it easy now. Don't rush it.
How you let men treat ya like they do?
Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?
Look it... I put the Goddamn dress on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...
Go'on and sing it, I'll play.
This Rae... you get with her?
Why you say that?
She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?
Don't know if God wanna see me.
Goin' dove huntin'?
Ain't gonna be moved?
Mm. MM. Now these eggs got some kick to it. What'chu got in this?
Then what?
What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...
Yeah, you know you home, old man. You just walked through the door.
Why she got a chain on her?
Please don't tell my daddy.
I skipped lunch.
It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie.  Cuz I love him so much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him... it's like I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else.
Hey.
But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...
Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to.
Alright. How much you need, ho?
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
Wait up.  You know the guy who did the Weismuller through the window --
Back-up.
Get rid of it.
Nick, have I been a good partner?
"Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire."  To the killer.  Jerry Lee Lewis.
I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
Ichiro --
We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
You did great, Ichiro.
I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.
I couldn't tell.
I'm sorry.
Don't give him any more.
An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.
Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
We're in?
No one's keeping him here.
Not in that company.
He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
What...?  What if I say no?
-- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them.
With these?
That wasn't our deal.
Where?
Not to be trapped.
Yeah.  It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian.  Why don't you go home.
Would you like to be modified?
I like a man who stays put.  An admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times. You live here all by yourself, do you?
What generation are you?
We have a lot in common.
I'd be happy to mention it to him.
I think, therefore I am.
What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
Take a number.  Canapt 1700, tenth floor, Villa Vita District, Olympia South.
Why, yes, of course.
Shot of vodka, please.
Those cockroaches?
My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?
You're going to be over the limit.
Why didn't you go?
I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures.
You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for?
That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.
How do you mean 'exploited'?
There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.
How come you're not on the job?
I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
What do people do in the afternoon?
Yeah.
It wasn't very good last night, was it?
They could clean around the arrangement.
You're sick, Deckard.
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
Because it's not.
What?
Yes.
One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?
How do you know I'm not?
You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.
But how come I'd be there?
But I understand what you mean.
Pris.
You look... better.
Ah, you get hold of your friends?
I'm Adam Webber.
We work on Rodeo Drive.  But we're both professional dancers.
I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
It's Webber.  Adam Webber.
How's that?
Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
Two weeks.
Get out!
I told you I've never driven before!
Thank-Q!
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
What about holding your right arm up like that all the time?
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
Okay. I like that.
I'm leaving, too.
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
Hi, Eve!
A card?
You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roulÈ!
Gerade aus dann links!
Like one of Mom's?
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!
...the pipe tobacco.
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
Right on the button.
This must be very new.
It's so small.
Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?
Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
Does that work?
Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.
Twenty-five? Around there.
I guess living up here makes people look older.
Hello.
He seems to be doing all right now.  I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we  need supplies and I've got to stay with him.
I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing.
Right.
This is your bedroom?
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
Well, where are you --
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
What about relatives?
The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
Home sweet home!
The locks?
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
Get the presents and do the lights.
Let's eat our cake.
Yes...
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
Well, I am the head of this household--
Well, please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...
Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.
Just be yourself.
Um... Eve?
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?
What do you want to do with it?
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore!
Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here.
I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
Doctor Gynde, my whole family's sick. What's going on?
I've seen a few.
Shit. Let's drink to something else. Let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.
You did? A human ear?
Jeffrey?
Anything you can tell me?
The criminals are winning.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
Not yet.
That oughta do it.
Never before this.
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
You can hit me, if you want to.
No.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
I liked being with you last night.
No.
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
It used to make me laugh, but.
I sure don't hate you.
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
You like to open me, don't you?
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone.
Do you love me?
I love you Don with all my heart.
Dorothy. No!
You called me Jeffrey.
Yes.
Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
He's comin' back? What for?
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Hello?
No thanks. What does that mean?
Go where?
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
I'm going out for awhile.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
How ya doin' Dad?
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Yes.
Yeah. What are you doing now?
I don't know.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?
Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?
I owe you, since I goofed up this one.
Yeah, but.
Wow. Should you tell my father?
I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
Shoot.
Oh yeah?
Okay.
I should go with her, Sandy.
Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.
Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
Look under the body.
Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco.
She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
What?
Shit.
You guys?
Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
What?! What are you doin'?
Well, we could try the bag over the head thing. Walk you right out the front.
What are you going to do?
Fuck!
me up the...
Hey Murphy?
No fuckin' hot water man. That...
He got beat up by a girl.
"What do we tell him about the guns and money?"
Aye.
Who did you kill?
With every breath we shall hunt them down.
There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth  Not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain.
So, what do we do now?
She was in here when it went down.
Can she I.D. them?
I felt it would bring closure to our relationship!
So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie.
New hitman wants to leave his mark
That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and think about it. Of all the ways to kill a guy, crushin' him to death. That's very particular. You don't get many of those. I dunno. I feel something big here. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of these turning up.
How many bodies, Greenly?
While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?
Uh.  Shit, I, uh...
They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur.
What if it was just one guy with six guns?
Right now.
Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
Why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious?
Yes.
Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
The laws of God are higher than the laws of man.
Yes.
I wouldn't have, uh, killed you, Father.  Dominus Ominus. Remember, you're bound. You can't talk about this... to anyone.
I always see you talking to the boys and making them laugh. They always come around telling me what a crack up you are. What is it they call you?
The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.
Making Hutch David Soul?
Right. The blond guy.
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
He says. This is he.
Now that window can never be locked. It's impossible.
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
Dignan, it's got an alarm.
Yeah, I heard that.
Is it back in?
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
Look at the treads on those.
Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?
Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road.
See, now we've got a plan.
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
I don't think we can do that.
Shut up!
What time did he say to be here?
You could give somebody a concussion.
Eleven fifteen.
Yeah. It's pretty good.
Yes. I do.
I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --
It's going back down.
Nobody move!
What?
He did?
What do you mean?
You're living on a sailboat?
Does it float?
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
What?
Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?
That was a test?
Well, he agreed 100% that Bob should be dropped. And he also agreed you were a liability. But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.
Future Man.
Who?
Did you ever steal a car before?
I hope not.
How long are they going to hold him?
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
Were you adopted, Bob?
No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
How do you say nineteen?
Are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms?
Like silk?
Nice to meet you, Applejack.
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.
Well, what do you think?
I'm not allowed to drive those.
No.
Yes. I did.
No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
That's my responsibility.
How much is there?
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!
Bob, that makes no sense.
This could be a trap.
Come on, Dignan.
Dignan.
Come on, Bob.
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
I couldn't hear anything.
I said to the DA, That cop who hit me must of given me CRS disease.
Do you have your own room?
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
You keeping out of trouble?
What do you mean grammar?
Where did he go?
Well, I left some money in there.
No. Just pool.
John Mapplethorpe.  How are you. Hi.
What?
That's not gonna fly.
Do you know what his budget was?
I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.
Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?
So what's he doing? You believe him?
They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.
I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
Sir...
She say what time I should call?
Lots of people...
You know I'm not.
YOU'RE A LIAR!
I have to go now.
I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
So...
Where --
You drive.
Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
I did.
It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
I killed him???
Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.
We need to get in there.
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
-- Kurt's reopening all the wyfi and sat links --
Show me.
It's a lot of money, Pam.
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
Did you?
Some women like Dobermans --
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!
But... what will you do?
Does anyone know his politics?
The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!
The Scots will fight for us?
They're coming!
Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?
Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity.
We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.
The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.
Thank you for accepting.
You've been here before?
I want... to marry you!
Tonight then.
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
I am the Princess of Wales.
Drink this! It will dull your pain.
It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!
Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!
Well, the good news is that the results are negative. I've found no evidence in the way of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors...
And the bad news?
No dances, just tell me.
All the dads are gonna be there.
That's why I wanted you to come here, Evan. Dr. Redfield already has a background in memory loss.
What happened?
Please, mom. People will talk.
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?
Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe.
This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex.
You really think he wanted to kill you?
Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?
No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.
Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you.
I know, but...
Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible.
Where... where are my clothes?
I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
I want you to take this, Lenny. Today's your day of atonement. I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby --
Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
Oh? There's proof now?
Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
...yes.
I was praying this curse would have ended with me.
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
So what's the point?
Smells like sex in here.
Come on, go on...
I couldn't cut the rope.
Leave us alone you sick fuck!
Listen to me good, Evan...
You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.
What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
I should have known.
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
Yes, Monsieur.
-- Will he keep his word?
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
You want my advice?
Monsieur Rick, I --
I won't.
-- Tonight he forgot.
I'd better be going.
Er, my check, please.
Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.
Yes, something.
Do you know where they are?
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
We said "no questions."
With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
And Laszlo?
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
Goodnight.
We are only interested in two visas, Signor.
I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
And I congratulate you.
My office.
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.
Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
I wonder if you do. I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed.
I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
I slept very well.
By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
And that is?
What else, my dear Major?
Good evening, gentlemen.
Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
You know, Rick, we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the Blue Parrot, but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here. It will amuse your customers.
That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
Oh, how do you do?
Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman.
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
You're late.
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.
Give me another.
Sacha, she's had enough.
Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --
I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.
Get me the Radio Tower!
Thank you.  Will you have a drink with me please?
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.
I like it fine here.
No.
Yeah, boss?
Six kilometers.  Four miles.
Nobody remembers that.
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix rope.
If they can't see you, what's the point?
Why do they have to die for me?
The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.
Nothing out there but ocean.
Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
Possible.  So you did those wings?
Yeah, a long one.
Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium again?
How was Russia?
Four four.  A record.
I thought you might have.
This is so unfair.
And how was your Christmas?
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
I used to drive one of those.  A long time ago.
Thought you were going to bring her.
Look, I help take care of the place.  You got my check, didn't you Mom?
I've got all this back pay coming.  Why don't you let me get you a place in town?
Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
You know what your problem is?  You just see the packages in front of you.  You don't see the big picture.
Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.
I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay attention.
When I first showed up, I thought you'd lost your fucking marbles.
What?
I need to do it.
Then I wasn't beautiful.
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
These *credentials* are against the law!
Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!
Whoever they were, they didn't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.
And that I can drive a truck!
Better than I can!
I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
I guess I'll see you around the orchards. Thanks for everything.
You've seen only one movie? Which one?
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.
Stop it! Just cut it out!
He's *paralyzed*!
I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.
I love you, Wally.
He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
Did you know your mother better?
Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*?
"I was a posthumous child. My father's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months, when mine opened on it."
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
I think I'd probably like the apple business.
No, I'm not. I need a job.
This is all normal. Don't worry. The abortion procedure... it affects you. It's the ether, too. It'll take a little time.
Well, sure... that's good, then.  All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer.
What's that? What's it called?
Yes, for both.
I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
Don't mess in this, Homer, if you know what's good for you.
We heard that one already, Homer.
Rose Rose?
I bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons'.
When the plane was hit, the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together. The copilot jumped third. All on Captain Worthington's orders-- the captain was still flying the plane. None of the men of the ground could see the sky--that's how thick the jungle was. They never saw the plane crash--they never *heard* it crash. They never saw Captain Worthington's parachute, either.
Then it's malaria?
You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
Where do you think you're going?
She took off in the night!
It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.
Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.
What do you do over at your bank, Grant?
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
Listen, what I'm about to tell you, I'm telling you in confidence, okay?  Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com?
Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.
Know who I am, Jake?
Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake.
Your life flashing before your eyes?
So much for honor among thieves. You would have cut loose your friends, your girl...
I was doing it for them.
It's not true.
Ten is standard, sir.
Jake...
I need you to stake me.
Stake you?
Oh yeah. Moonan. I remember now. Thanks.
Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo with a black suitcase. You got Moonan under control?
Don't worry about it.
What?
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.
Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would.
No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
He was looking out for you.
I was supposed to meet him for breakfast. He likes that new IHOP they just opened, you know... He likes to order that thing. The Rutti- Tutti-Fresh and Fruity thing they got.
Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...
But if you wanna talk about bad luck...
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
Egg Foo Young.  Stand up.
Aces, Suits.
In over your head?
I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
Coupla things. They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split.
Like we told you before, we think he's into something with the King Pin --
What do you get out of it?
This guy must have been a real pain in your dick.
Hope so. Those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me. One fifty every time they tighten those bitches up. One fifty! It's not even covered.
You trust this Moonan guy?
High five.
Jack. Do you need a ride?
I can imagine.
The Indian rope-trick.
Not like Matt, you mean.
What?!
Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.
I want a job, Giles.
I'll try and make it.
I don't gamble.
Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
And your lady?
450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
I'll leave the casino soon.  I promise.
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
I hate public transport.
For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Have you written that name down? Reynolds, at the Golden Lion. 
What kind of trouble?
I know that. But you can now.
Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
It doesn't seem fair. You're offering me ten grand in cash but you can't afford a decent place.
Well, life's not fair. We know that.
Would you like a drink?
Of course I recognised him!
Have I?
And what do you do, Lucy?
Nice car.
I'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you. I mean that.
If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
Just girls. What are you drinking?
Hey Jack, join us.
I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet.
You've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet.
Has he?
You use two alternating, don't you?
You want me to check?
Let me just run through a few things. As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. We'll need your picture.
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
Why don't you take a break, Jack.
How do you feel, Jack?
What was that, I didn't hear...
Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven.
Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.
Energy shielding positive function.
Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
But you can't explode in the bomb bay. It's foolish. You'll kill us all. There's no reason for it.
You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?
Hey, bomb...
In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.
Exactly.
Yes, well...
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever find real intelligent life out there?
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.
-- automatic channels open --
...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
The waves at Malibu and Zuma were fantastic in the springs Talby. I can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit...
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
Doolittle! Help me.
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
We're running out of time, sir.
Sir?
'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend?  Who would take offense to that?
Why would I be pissed?
I was crazy about you...am crazy about you.  But you keep everyone at arm's length like there's some great big dark something going on that-- I don't know... It's just that the more I tried to get close to you, the more you pulled away.
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
I know.
Are we in some kind of trouble?
Mommy, where are you?
Girl's gotta make a living.
I was expecting someone else.
You have good taste.  French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus.
No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.
Who is...
Girlfriend?
Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--
How do I know you didn't?
It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
How well do you remember the lab?
What's in it for you?
My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
We're quoting Mom again.
Any idea when she'll be back?
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble.
Who's this guy?  This isn't who we're looking for...her name was Hannah.
Thank you.
I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.
Got a pencil?
Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
That's odd...
Tell me the truth.  Am I a female fog bank?
A fog bank.
Friends don't help other friends cheat.
Only one I can think of.
Not right now.
Right, the big one-oh.
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
I'm a toy to her.
You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.
I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better.
And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
True, but--
You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
You love him?
What's that?
I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
I feel like such an idiot. Why didn't I just say something a year and a half ago? Man, think of how much time we wasted.
Coming dad.  I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.
So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?
Tease? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids?
But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!
We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car.
What the fuck!
I think we should try sneaking in.
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
No.
I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked!
Simplicity, Hawk.
About fuckin' time if you ask me. I'm just going through the motions till I drop out anyway.
It's gone.
Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna see KISS that ba...
You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.
No, you gimme your gun, boy!
GOOD MORNING!
Theoretically.
If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?
What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?
You have to do something for me first.
Why do they call you Frank?
Wanna walk me home?
Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?
I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.
Why not just buy your baby a night light?
Well...
I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
Hey.
Did you call the cops?
The Lifeline is divided that way.
You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.
Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?
So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?
So, I met a new friend.
His name is Frank.
I think about... fucking a lot during school.
A sign from whom?
I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...
Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
But you were punished.
What else makes you feel regret?
Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
Why?
Your medication. They're placebos. Just pills made out of water.
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
I was just being honest.
Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school.
Kitty...
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
But now you can't go.
Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
Is Mom okay?
Where is she?!
I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
"Here," wh-wh-what?
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
Oh shit!
Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
That's it, I'm goin'...
We was robbed.
Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on?
Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.
Okay... well, bye.
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
Well, excuse me, Annette, but I'm braggin' up your kid, here.  Amber's gonna be the next Diane Sawyer, y'know...
All right, they're makin' a movie.
Don't fall for it. She lives two trailers down.
It smells funny. Like gasoline.
We're also the co-founders of the Minnesota Modeling Academy. Applications are at the tiki bar. We'll wave the fifty dollar application fee if you list a friend and put her address.
Okay?
Wisconsin.
All right, then.
Last year? It was, "Buy American."
Gladys -- Gladys! Look out!
Iris, stop!  It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them.
I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
Oh! What is it?
You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
From what I have been gathering, I think they think I should be king: I think they think I should be king!
The king can do no wrong! 
Is that all?
Dear Sir... enclosed find check for $100.  Yours very truly...  Send that immediately.
Here I am, Father...
Eureka Ammunition Company, Gentlemen. Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight.  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way. However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty and I don't say that to everybody.  Have not received last month's drawing account; how come your neck is like a swan.  Yours very truly...
Have you got a license?
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
You told it to me.
Now -- how many men you got in your army?
Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
Sure.
I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.
You worm!
Then it's war?
I'm sorry we lost our tempers... I'm willing to forget if you are.
What I called you...  Why, what did I call you?
Why - er - Mrs. Teasdale - this is an outrage!  This man is impossible... My course is clear...  this means war...  You RUNT!
I hope I'm not interrupting.
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
You know I think they think I should be king.  Although it would please me to govern the throng, suppose I were king and then everything went wrong.
Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!
Oh, would you...?
I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
What happened?
Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.
I want my man back.
You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.
I want him back!
You've acquired a taste for this?
Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional.
Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
Three quarters of an hour.
O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?
I want you to know that I don't go about giving my pictures to just anyone.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
Romance!
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.
Oh, yes.
Thank you very much.
Mmmerrick.
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside still waters. He restoreth my soul: He Guideth me in the paths of righteousness...
You did this for me?
Mr. Treves! Treves.
Stand up, John. Let them see you.
Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today?
Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him...
Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?
Won't come out, eh?
He's had his share of "smacks", Mothershead. I expect that's what drives him under the bed. We must use patience and understanding with this man.
Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
I said welcome.
Please! Please! What are those?
What are what?
What's the matter?
We never went to bed together.
That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE...
Who?
Yes -- I believe you do.
Then I shall come too.
LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
But --
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
No... we don't...
REALLY?
Really.
I'll tell you what...
Don't talk nonsense.
Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
Louder.
Have you tried to ask the God for anything?
Erik! Row! What are you doing?
How deep IS the ocean?
We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
It's always the women that start the trouble.
I want to die...  No, I don't!
What are YOU doing here?
It's magic.
What did he say?
We don't HAVE to help anybody.
So?
Erik the Viking! The things you seek are not in our power. We don't make men love each other or hate each other.
I've got you!
Who gets killed?
Wait, Erik!
What do you think?
Well, what else do we do?
She hasn't got any.
Bye, Leif.
Bye... sorry...
You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard.
I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
Together we stand!
Are you going to let Erik wake the Gods?
YOU do it!
She knows it was our fault!
We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt!
Well, of course he is!
There is nothing we can do...
Shut up.
And if you have to kill somebody, KILL them! Don't stop to think about it.
You weren't supposed to see that.
I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it. You okay? You seem quiet.
Shit. The last time I saw you.
But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it.
I'm so excited. Yay!
I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
I can't remember.
I'm sure you would.
My name's Clementine, by the way.
No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
You know Wilmont?
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?
But I think I am. I like to think I am.
You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.
I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --
What do you mean?
I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...
Really? Is he cute?
God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
Probably.
I know.
It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
Okay.
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
Me too. There's this poem --
Female.
I think we should go.
When?
Oh, um...
Hey, Joel --
-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
Says you were a bully...
I can't stop thinking about you.
I guess so.
I probably got the same thing as you.
Hi.
I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.
You have to stop this!
No. I just need some space, maybe.
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.
Oh! Great. That's great!
Boo.
It's amazing, isn't it? Such a gift Howard gave the world.
It's stopped.
Sor-ry  We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
Mary...
That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
How do you mean?
There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander.
Alexander Pope?
Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
You can if you want.
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
Hold on. Let me ask my friend.  Stan, can I leave for a little while? My girlfriend is very --
Is everything getting worse?
Where are the others?
Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do.
Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.
Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner.
I have to go, Julian.
Whooee!
But Countess...
Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.
I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?
You still need the rope? I thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins.
You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
You been out there a long time. Trying to break my record?
Carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations, impaired judgement...
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
Please...
You're not seriously considering sending him?
...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal.  It's called a gravity drive.
How do you know all this?
That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.
What's the hold up?
Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.
Skipper...
"Insane?" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day...
The date.
What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?
That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit!
Where has it been for the past seven years?
I DON'T KNOW!  I don't know. There's a lot of things going on here that I don't understand. Truth takes time.
Weir is dead.
There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only... NOTHING.
You're lying...!
What are you trying to say? "If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings?"
Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby?
But...
...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew...
Thank you.
Skipper...
Smith, get out of there...
Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.
Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.
Carbon dioxide?
What's causing the readings?
Maybe one of the original crew?
No. It was someone else.
What?
Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can!
First time in a grav couch?
Claire...
Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?
Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
He's engaged the override.
I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women...
A straight line.
Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.
I don't think She's real big on hate.
You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring, whispering --
Ben, come in.
He's made a few changes.
We had a tough year.
Time for your lesson, Vic. Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...?  Ben...
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Where... where am I?
Hey! That's a prototype!
And where do we think we're going?
Victor's right. Johnny, get to the command center. Close the shields.
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
You two need a time-out.
Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
Feeling better?
Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.
Anger. Rage. Frustration.
Are you kidding?
Why didn't you say something?
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
We've got minutes until it hits, not hours... Victor, that storm's deadly -- the radiation's lethal. We need to abort.
Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back...
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
It's the first door on your left!
You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
Well, I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here.
U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
I take out the garbage.
They're not home yet.
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
I'm just guessing.
I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag.
You first.
I think we're making a lot of noise.
Why don't you call me up tonight?
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
Damone, are you there?
No Damone. I don't understand.
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.
Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
How've you been?
It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!
We just missed the turnoff to the party.
Just be glad you're all right.
How's it going.
Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
What variables?
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here.
I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?
Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban.
I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
Yeah. I'm registered for this class.
Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here!
Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
Aloha, Mr. Hand!
You look like you could still be in high school.
Thanks. So do you.
It's very warm out tonight.
Are you really nineteen?
What do you do with the jackets people leave here?
I don't know.
Do you really have to go?
It's John Bonham's birthday.
I made a fool of myself.
Are you ready to order here?
Anything to drink?
Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.
But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning?
There's no hurry! The race is over!
Let's have lunch!
What's the message? My light is blinking.
A major!
What do you mean by that?
A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type.
I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.
This is my granddaughter...
I tell you, my man. This is the American Dream in action! We'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end.
Shoot it.
That's good...
Why?
Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch out!... Why money? My name is Brinks; I was born... Born?
That dirty bastard! I knew it! He's got hold of my woman!
Have you made a deal with him? Did you put him on to her?
What tape?
Not me. It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it!
You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you?
What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram?
NO! Stop talking like that.
Sometimes it's easier to just rip out the backstraps.
Good work.  They'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that.
Adrenochrome...
Where'd you get this?
Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it.
May I see your license.
Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
Yeah.
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
Hey! Get quiet or get out.
We'll be food, dickheads!
So, your husband ditched you?
You all sure about this?
Ohhh.
Any more ideas Animal Planet?
I'm telling ya, you got the cloth too deep, you're asking for it.
Why do you take shit from him?
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
Oh, no.
He's dead.
Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
Is it gassed up?
Two.
What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
Sit still, look less like a meal.
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
Well, maybe they migrate?
DON'T!
Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?
What did we say about lying?
You know that no one likes a liar, right?
Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
I'm not!
You're afraid!
Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
In my eyes, officer.
Get your clothes on, lady --
Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name?
We're all square now, Harry. Right?
Were you an alcoholic?
I know.
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
Bread?
You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
I wouldn't miss it.
Why?
...Not if I can help it.
Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
Whattaya mean?
I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.
Enh.
Quietly.
Jesus.
He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done.  Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job.  I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman.  How d'ya like the camouflage?
Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.
Who ever thought they'd be right for once? Jesus, Harry... it's a zoo back there --
Some people starve, kid. Until we can do something about it, they might as well see a movie. Makes 'em feel better.
But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something... 
Tell you what. Let's ditch the limo. Let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up Chevy.
I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.
I guess.
To quarter-horses.
Who's writing this guy's lines?
You're on your way to a contempt citation, young lady.
What happened? Who're you?
Who're you?
Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
The speech? Real good.
It's okay.
What's wrong?
No!
Oh, just leave those things for now.
Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
She told me you said, "Mama, you want to kill me."
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
I longed to be with him. But I wanted his final moments to have peace. I could see you were a friend to him.
What kindness?
I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart?  And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.
There is something I want.  A friend.
Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
You dance so beautifully together.
And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
What kind of God is He to will this?
Father's so proud.
I give you my soul...
Victor. I love you,
What sort of task?
Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
I'm quite serious. Look at all the charity and clinic work we do. Up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of.
...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before.
And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
Victor. This has got to stop.  Nobody's seen you in months. You haven't attended a single class.
Thank God your fever broke.  Slowly, now. Just a sip.  I've been worried we might lose you. It's been touch-and-go for a week.
Is that your diagnosis?
Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
Re-configure the leads?
Do you share my madness?
That's got her. Thanks. I'm Steve Christy. Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake. You got some grubby clothes? Climb into 'em. Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out the boathouse. I want him to start with the canoes. What happened to Brenda?
You think you're gonna last all summer?
Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?
You can only do what you can do.
Help you clean up?
What's the matter with it?
I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's. Today wiped me out.  Thanks, Alice.
Ha!
Jack?
It's gonna be a long summer.
Umhummmmph.
Anything else you want?
You can't go back there tonight. Not in that stuff. 'Less you wanta get drownded.
Unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking, what say we drop this?
Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm running this show, I make the decisions.
You don't believe in suicide.
What's this about, money?
Died instantly?
Yes.
Why'd ya quit?
I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?
I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.
Yes.
Why not, against your religion?
I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.
I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
What's this stuff?
Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?
It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
Not good enough, swear to God.
Where are you taking us?
In the room. Were you serious, or were you just foolin' around? I'm just bringing it up, 'cause if you really want me to do that for you, I will.
Yeah.
Not even for lunch?
Isn't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public?
You could sue the shit out of her, ya know. That kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. You could own that fuckin' place.
That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
What the fuck was that about?
When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
Gotcha!
All I'm saying --
What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin' woman, the hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!?
No, I didn't.
This ain't the time, Richard.
We are...  "South of the border down Mexico way."
That's what you think?
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
My shit is together.
B.O.Q., south side.  Take a starboard tack out the door.
But are there... I mean, how many...
-- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this "G.I. Jane" thing.
Standing right here in my office.
"Security"?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure?
Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?
All right, lieutenant, give me a name and specifics, I'll have the X.O. file an action first thing in the morning.  A name?
No, sir, WHAT?
I don't know of any delicate way to say this, lieutenant, so I won't try.  Claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization -- of the same-sex variety.  Specifically, that you were...  "... seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming."
I'm saying, we're just friends.
I'm not sure what --
Entering my scan now...
Yes?
"The Lark Report."
California.
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
Yes, dear.
Uh, ma'am.
Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --
What changed?
You were never going to let women serve in combat.  You always had a safety net.  Or thought you did.
I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly.
Montgomery, why do they call you "Flea"?
Close as I can get, el-tee!
Just do it, okay?
She's a trainee, just like the others.  Why are you coming down so hard?
She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
I'll try anyway, sir.
I was looking for him earlier, but...
Just a coincidence?
Lieutenant O'Neil.
So dump on me.
Me?  Why me?
I saw an article...
Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
All I wanted was an honest chance. And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't stay.
"John James Urgayle."  The Chief.
Instructors typically pull three year assignments.  This guy's in and out in one year -- your year.  That sound right?
It was made clear.  Anyway, stay ballsy.  First week's hell, then it levels out.  Until S.E.R.E. training, anyway.  That's hell-and-a-half.
They had to kill 'em?
O'Neil?
Permission to get dressed, sir?
It seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs.  Israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives.  They don't use women anymore.
Simple question, lieutenant.  No reason not to answer.  What is your father's name?
Wasn't deemed a threat.
I think you're the liar.
Do you?
Got it.
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school.  The implications go way beyond.
I take it this file is still open.
Hey, hey! I'm eating here!
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
What are you doing?
What are you talking about? The east side is always faster.
When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change.  I never lost my idealism.
And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy.
And I'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman's expense p.o.'s.
Did you talk with Humphries?
And you're beautiful...
We? I don't think so.
Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?
Make sure they find that nest before it's too late.
They will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten.
We've secured the doors on both levels.
Dr. Niko Topopolosis?
It's Tatopoulos.
Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm?
What sample?
That was a footprint. I was standing inside a footprint.
Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
It's the French Secret Service.
I need you to trust me.
Who the hell are you?
Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.
Good luck on your mission, Sir. By Grabthar's Hammer, by the Suns of Warvan I wish you-
Sir! The pressure.  It's normalizing.
... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...
God, what an ass.
We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
I was staying in character.  "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
Not again...
Why didn't you stop at the market?
You could order something in.
No I didn't.
He always has to make the big entrance.
Yes...?
No,  I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.
Up.
I just can't believe it. Any of it!  Look at this room!.. They designed it based on the Tuaran Pleasure ship from "historical document" thirty seven.  Oh and wait, wait, listen to this!  Computer?
Hey Commander. Listen, we found some Beryllium on a nearby planet. We might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion. What do you think?
"Crewman #6"... Call me Guy.
Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?
Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
They're gone.
What?
One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
I made the CUT THE LINE gesture. You nodded okay.'
Are they behind us?
I heard it too.
Right.  Well... Listen, I'm  I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding.  I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... How's the uh...  ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that.
Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
How can we thank you, Commander. You- You have saved our people.
It's perfectly safe. I promise.
Then how did he find out about the device?
Our former Commander was not... Strong.
Mathesar? What is that?
But...Why?
That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps.
Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with-
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
All right guys... Uh... Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. Fred, you and Guy need to get that air valve back on.  Alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy can't get the oxygen back in time.
WHAT? WH
Because they're coming right at us.
Over three hundred miles.
You seem pleased by the prospect.
Arnold!
Congress has picked up it's skirts and is racing for Baltimore. They're not waiting for spring!  Of course, they still had time to deny my promotion.  Even John Adams voted against it...
We're in bad shape, Benedict, moral is low.  Before I can do anything, I need Lee and his seven thousand troops.  I've ordered him to join us three times.  In my last letter I all but begged him to come here. The man is insubordinate.
The army can survive without me.
None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
Wil, I'm giving you your freedom. Do you understand?
No, my lord.
I'm so inclined.
I was a clerk's apprentice on Saint Croix.  But, then I went to King's College.
Good day, Mister Adams... George, what's the word from Boston?
He's from Virginia -- there is no more classist, elitist... English place on earth than Virginia.  And, what in hell has he done for our cause?  Washington has been preaching compromise, compromise, compromise!  Hancock acts, he led the Boston Tea party!  That's why New England loves him.
You think that?
Detained by what?
Any word from Canada?
My God... They mean to finish us. What about Arnold?  He's up there.
I mean, I'm a Deist.  A belief I share with the likes of Tom Jefferson and Ben Franklin.  Surely you knew that.
They help me understand why we fight.
The man is a traitor!
I... they look both the same.
Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
And how rusty are these muskets?
I rode here, on my horse.
My God!  Who ordered this retreat?!
General Lee, sir!
When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
Some things must never change.
Martha!  For God's sake!
They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
So, you are William's wild young neighbor?  Or should I say, 'brother'; William claims you as a member of his family.  I have heard so many unflattering tales about you, and I understand, that except for you, this 'family' is quite cultivated.
Is it?  Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom.
I see...
That?  I hear a mob:  unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.
What is this?
Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
He's gonna plea-deal his way out. Give up this ace stunt man now one of the West Coast dope kings, if they go easy on the Cat.
After this one, I'm out, Cat, you understand? This is the last time we talk to each other.
Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline?
Trade for what?
He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money.
Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
But first I want to know who I'm talking to. Am I talking to you, or am I talking to him?
It's what he said, I'm his associate.
I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.
There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
She's great. Gimme the money.
Harry, you think we go to see your movies? I've seen better film on teeth. Makes no difference to me which one our money's in. So how 'bout you take our twenty points out of "Freaks" and put 'em in this other one, "Mr. Loverboy".
I can't do it.
I'm working on a few things.
I don't know.
Ray Barboni?
Okay. So who are you?
Or else what?
I checked the bag at the airport, when I came.
Look, there's no reason you and I shouldn't get along. Forget all the bullshit from before -– I don't even remember how it started. You took a swing at me over some fuckin' thing, whatever it was -– forget it. You owe me some money, right? Forget that too. But, you don't say a fuckin' word about this to anybody. It's strictly between you and me, right?
Who the fuck are you?
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?
That's the idea. I'll think about it.
Why do I have to keep looking at you?
You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.
Really? You ever been arrested?
"Mr. Lovejoy".
So what's the problem?
But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.
That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.
Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself. See if he wants to invest in my movie.
It was in the Herald.
Twenty seven hundred.
Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loanshark Operation in Miami.
I turn it on when I confront the guy.
It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation.
You've been losing.
I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.
You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
We call you a taxi.
The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?
I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped.
Right. See how your story ends.
I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
There a part in it for you?
I was never much into it. All that bullshit having to do with respect. It's bad enough having to treat those guys like they're your heroes, having to smile when they make some stupid remark they think's real funny.
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
You okay?
How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
He already knew it.
That's great, Harry. So what's the --
He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.
'We?'
Which two?
What money?
A passenger liner, north island. Over.
North Island, have you got any additional information? Over.
Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think it's a problem.
They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
Damn mind of it's own.
Where's his boat, then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure.
Where from?
What?
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.
Last thing we want is extra partners.
What other choices have we got?
Guess I'll just keep working.
Smokes?
Try Wednesday.
What is it?
Like I always say --
The right way and the wrong way.
But how long?
Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be doing if we don't get this boat running.
That'd be my guess.
I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait.
Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.
You okay?
Go on.
She was sailing up north, right?
Why not call for help?
Just before I heard him yell there was somebody on the radio.
The ah... the radio's out.
"The crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill."
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
Epps, over.
Epps? You there?
What?
It's funny.
Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
You don't remember?
Better late than never.
Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
Someone from the past.
Give up?
Yup.
Pumpkin, are you in there?
I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.
What do you mean "on his way up"!?
Don't be silly, anyone can dance. Here, just follow me... watch my feet.
Hey, it's nearly nine already - we're gonna have to leave now if we're going to make that movie.
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...
Who is this, Enid?
And how does an image like this help us to see that?
I...
I'm gonna let you handle the four thirty crowd by yourself - that way I can evaluate your performance while it's slow and ease you into the bigger crowds.
Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
Hi.
What do you mean "why"?
You must have known all along how I -- you know -- how I felt about you -- it must be totally obvious...  God... I always used to dream about this...
Why not?
Since when is she an "actress"?
Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh?
How perfect.
God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want.  It's such a weird feeling.
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
You can have that one.
Jesus! Listen to this one: "Do you remember me? Airport shuttle, June 7th. You: striking redhead with yellow dress, pearl necklace, brown shoes. I was the bookish fellow in the green cardigan who helped you find your contact lens. Am I crazy, or did we have a moment?"
Does Oomie really like this show?
Hey - why do you have this?
There's my dad with Joanie.
Is he wearing a green cardigan?
What's going on now? What's he doing?
He doesn't even look that bummed out, really.
What are you talking about?
Just promise you'll do it.
What? How long have you been standing there?
What was that all about?
I don't believe you.
That rules!
Yeah, well...  So when are you going to get your job?
I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.
Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
Which one?
Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
Do you want to do something tonight?
Don't you want nice stuff?
Hello?
I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.
What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
Do you want anything?
Really? Both of you?... Why not?
Shhh!
Seymour does.
What?
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
Oops! I dropped it!
What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks?
Oh, come on! What are you talking about?
No you're not! You're a cool guy, Seymour.
I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute!
I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!
We need to narrow this down somehow... we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests.
Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" - isn't child pornography totally illegal?
I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!
Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...
For nineteen years...
Hey, I get good benefits, a good early retirement plan, nobody ever bothers me...
Really?
Never mind, it's way too complicated...  Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?
Oh, hi...
So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this week --
Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing?
I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
...I better not...
Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...
I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
...What do you mean?
I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?
...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
Let me tell ya somethin', Joe... Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a home run without swinging the bat!
So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?
Did you remember to pay the phone bill?
I am.
I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all, what kind of sculpture is this?
It's a "found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
Really, I don't know enough about it to...
On that pathetic fake blind date.
No hints, Samuel.
But I have in India- every country presents problems.
I do need to see Starling.
I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger.
I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him.
You don't enjoy killing, do you? 
You never had it.
Oh dear-  -you're geting that downtrodden look again-
Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
You said "of course" you'd need the donkey. Why "of course"?
I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
John? I know this isn't the time to ask, but-
...one shot...
Second death? Where?-
What did I do?
I don't really. But understand something- even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out-  -when I'm gone, you'll still have to build the bridge. And I don't want the men to have lost respect for you.
Yes. And I'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever.  Can you control your fear?
I'll have to.
Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
You like him, don't you?
Oh yes. But it takes time.
Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz.
Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!
We don't have a relationship.
Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the grocery bags from her.
Okay, that's no problem.
Hello, Peter.
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
What do you think?
Oh, hello, Peter.
I don't know what to do anymore.
Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
Are you all squeaky clean now?
Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century.
That's not true.  It was 1620.
Before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?
Who are you going to call?
Well, good night, Louis.
The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child that I might live again.
Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.
They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders on the psych ward.
Egon!
I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
It's working.  The positive GeV's are climbing.
Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?
Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there.
Six feet -- seven -- eight --
Is the line sinking?
Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble.  The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.
Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone crazy?
Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff.
Huh?  What?
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
How deep does it get?  That water's cold and I can't swim.
My people weren't taking any pictures from those slave ships, man.  And there wasn't any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome them, either.  What are you, Dana?
Aren't you glad we waited?
I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
Hey, it's crazy in here.  You're missing a classic party.
Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
Really!  Is it gone?
Did you see it?  What was it?
That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?
Egon, there's something very strange about that man.  I'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you.  I'm afraid you're going to die.
Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
I'm Walter Peck.  I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District.
Yes, it would.
Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
You turned off the power!  Look, there was another man here ... You have to find him and bring him back.  A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie.
Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
Wait!  Wait!  Let me ask you something.  If you like shot Superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?
I'm always serious.
Did you see anything?
What?
I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
Gozer.
It's working!
Set entry grid.
I need two new purge valves.  How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
What is it?
Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.
For what purpose?
My parents left me that house, I was born there.
But most people are afraid to even report these things.
How was your date?
Third floor.  Get down here,
I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?
No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with there?
Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
Right.  And the sky would fall ...
Those are priceless sculptures.
How about in the forum.  Right in front of the Senate.
For the gods, spit it out!
Kill him!  Tribuus -- execute that bastard.
"... encased in the armor of a demigod, Narcissus The Good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast..."
Gladly Caesar.
Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
Caesar, ignore them.
And like children everywhere they scream "freedom" the most when they desire it least.  I beg you, please continue, Caesar.
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
So am I.
Marcus Aurelius has died.
We must obey our emperor and the Senate.
Tribuus, what happened in the arena? Was Narcissus killed?
This is Cos, this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've invited him to write a small piece about you...
You know our two most senior Senators:  Gaius Cantus and Falco Verus?
Sneaking around with your brother?
You mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist.
"If you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic, then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men, just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads. But..."
Where are they?
Servis made it through again?
The Senators admire you.
I see the emperor's little boy has finally caught up with the army.
My troops don't make policy.
I can see that...
Who else?  I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome!  Or for the glory of you!
I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...
You're not going!  You have to stay with us!
I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.
You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.
Sorry but I have to get at least one fight out of you otherwise I won't even get back the cost of the bribe I had to pay the arena slaves to get you here.  I know what you're trying to do:  kill yourself and trust in the Roman tradition of justice that the emperor will let your family survive and keep their lands.  The only thing you have accomplishes is to prove you're a very important individual.  You make me feel good about my investment!  And that puking pig Jerses -- he won't even discuss you.  Both of you have clamped mouths!  But I love all my fighters -- I'll find out about your family.  And about you.  That I promise.
You put this inside your shirt -- when Tiger stabs your stomach -- it's full of pig's blood.  Gushes out everywhere!  It's really impressive.  Fantastic!  Better than the real thing!
You get to come alive again in the country!
As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
Then get a large cash advance.
Let's talk about this later.  Right now we have other things to settle. You and your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning in the morning to Ostia.  From there, Caesar has decreed you be given an estate in Paestum.  It's beautiful; an old Greek town right on the ocean.  Rich soil.  Perhaps we could keep our financial arrangements... although Caesar will give you a sort of pension it's always good to look to the future, keep your hand in the arena... so to speak.
I think I'd better go home now please.
Where is the car?
Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.
I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
What's the matter?
Elaine --
The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
I've never been to it.
Benjamin -- I would like to know what you're doing here.
Why?
Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
Shhhh.
No.
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
Yes, I will.
Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
Well here's the purse.
Benjamin?
Where are you?
Can I help you, sir!
What?
The Singleman party, sir?
A room. I'd like a room, please.
Why not?
Drink?
Are you always this much afraid of being alone?
What do you think of me?
Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
Pardon?
What?
What is wrong with me?
Yes.
No.
We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
Yes?
Oh. Well, goodnight.
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
Where is it?
Don't be nervous.
Yes.
Do you want to?
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
Well -- I don't know.
Benjamin.
Benjamin.
Would this be easier for you in the dark?
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
On your first time --
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.
Then why do you want to talk about it?
Can I take off my clothes now?
Yes I do.
I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you -- how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.
He's asleep.
We're talking.
So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
Well how do you feel about him, then?
Is it?
What?
Well I can't.
Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
Yes.
Do you remember the make of the car?
Don't talk about Elaine?
Do you understand that?
Good.
Well, I'm not.
Because -- Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out.
That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
Then give me your word you won't.
Hello. Get me the police, please.
I say I've got it.
What?
I drive around.
You believe me, don't you?
I do.
What about it?
Why?
Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate.
Thank you very much, sir.
Ben -- how old are you now?
In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
I will.
Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
No, I don't.
It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
That's quite a statement.
Can you see me now?
What's happening?
I don't believe it.
Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --
I have an idea working in my head... 
You?
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
Very little.
Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?
You're very funny --
Of course.
I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
Please do not be frightened, Madam.
Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone. 
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear -- 
The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.
I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
No?
And?
That's a silly joke.
I'll go -- good-bye.
Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
I can't.
No?
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
And this is Doctor Otternschlag.
I'm going to change and we'll meet for a drink in the Yellow Room.
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately.
No -- not at all.
I thought she was splendid!
Oh, let the poor devil alone.
We shall see who remains here the longer.
Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.
For me?
The stenographer is to go up -- Mr. Preysing telephoned.
No, Doctor.
You're tired. I can see that.
Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.
Well, Mr. Kringelein, are you getting what you're looking for?
Everything?
I'm engaged for the evening.
No - absinthe.
I don't know -- I'd like to do anything --
Oh -- oh, Miss Flaemmchen. It's you --
So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
I didn't like Preysing right off.
Moreover...
A thousand marks -- 
Come here. 
Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing.
Why not?
I'd like to wait for Justice Zinnowitz, before I commit myself.
Sorry, Preysing. 
...and let me say again for the tenth time...  ...you people were quite ready for the merger. You declared yourselves... fully agreed on all the terms -- Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?
You're a deep one.
Good morning, Suzette.
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof.
It is time for the performance.
There was -- there was.
He will be on the train.
An embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing.
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
Yes, I know them --
It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
How is the house?
What's the use of asking, Gru -- he is at the train -- He will be there.
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
'Deal with Manchester definitely off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have thought it of you.
Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm...
Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
You mean, the insurance frammis?
And if you do it wrong?
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.
Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
Yes, yes, but that's --
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
I know.
This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all?
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
What's up?
Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen?
Sounds like a good Idea.
But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
Well... You're all right now, I guess. I have to get down to the track.
Thanks, uh, Lilly.
My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.
Lucky? You call that lucky?
Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain?
It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a break for me after all. I've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I'm out. I can make a clean start, and --
I need this, Roy. I can't run without money, and if I can't run I'm dead.
You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
I know you do, so that's why --
If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age?
A future. The only future I've got.
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
This time...
Let me see how you did that one.
Mm?
You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?
You called the doctor, huh?
Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you.
What?
You're on the grift. Same as me.
I've heard the name.
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!
Think about it. Okay?
I still don't see why we have to have separate rooms. You expect your father to come through?
You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us.
Don't I get any say in this?
That's what I say.
What is it? What's going on?
I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.
Gun?
Why am I here?
They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
One set of muddy shoe prints.
Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.
Only the real stiffs.
Carter.
It's Amy Kramer.
Who are you, the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?
Oh.  Sorry.  I'm on my way to the ring and --
Jimmy, what are you doing?
You sure?
Well, Dad thinks it's okay.
Forget it.
It's an option.
Any other psychotic relatives I should know about?  Jason?  Freddy Krueger?
What?  Where is she?
Oh, God... no... not Molly.
Call me Laurie, will ya?
Where'd you get it?
You stole it?
What are you doing here?!
Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
I know.  I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate.  Please let me keep the job... it's the only way I can afford to stay here.
The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
The serial killer?
No, Will, this isn't the alcohol talking.  It's the truth.
Oh, right.  Sorry.
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
Thanks!
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
You've been watching too much TV.
No, Mom -- keep it on!
Mom, I want to go to the fair ...
Come on, Mom.  We're gonna miss all the fun stuff!
Mommy, I'm scared.
Relax, John.  They were just kids.
Who are you?
He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room.  His sister's room. Right here. Where it all began.
What makes you think he'll come here again?
Black magic ...  'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause sickness, famine and death. Translated literally, it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices ... on the Celtic celebration of Samhain.'
Danny!  Danny, where are you?!
Christ, what a night!  Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road!
Sam, don't -- let them take care of her.
There's more people moving eastbound down Old Reservoir Road past the elementary school.
Where's the child?
It was you.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
Samhain.
Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
Hm?
I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants.
Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
How everybody says "fuck" and "shit" all the time.  I used to be scared shitless I'd say "fuck" or "shit" in public, by accident.  Now everybody says "fuck" and "shit," "fuck" and "shit" all the time. Something very big must have happened while we were out of the country.
At least we found the diamonds.
At least!
Tell them yourself!
Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change!
Otherwise, how are things?
Could have happened to anybody.
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
I dunno.
I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
Hi, Penelope.
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
You never played a violin.
If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live."
I wanted to apologize.
Blue soup.
It's possible, of course, that you'll die in Africa.
You're making a joke.
It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!
You were about to ask a question?
Is anybody besides you here now?
Everybody says he was so brave.
Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
She met him at college.
Excellent!
Oh hell.
Uck.
The story gets hairier.  Should I stop?
I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
I can't take my eyes off you.
Damn.
Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
Dad--
It's your house, Dad.
A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.
I'm engaged.
Bluh.
Now that's what I call fun.
I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream.  So tense, so tense.
Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
"Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler."
Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
Cook, by God!  Cook!  You're the nigger now.
This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.
Go on.
Yes.
And he keeps it in his apartment?
And no one's there now?
I don't think so.
Did you like it, dear?
Things.
See how you've upset him.  He was so merry and hale before you came home.
Like what?
With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy.
I plan to live one hundred years!
No you don't.
Honor, I suppose.
I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
Help your mother find the bullet.
How do I load?
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
Will you please go?  An emergency!
Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy!
Safe and sound, I see.  Oh--you came back.
More and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people.  Curare, ephedrine--we've found some amazing things.
It died for your sins.
What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me.
You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice?  Will I bleed from my every orifice?  Who will clean up this awful mess?
Oooooo.  That hurt.
I haven't told you, Harold, how comical I think you are.
King Arthur.
You hope.
Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?
I've struck my blow.
You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a clown?" And the answer is, "Yes."
You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?
Like the saber-toothed tiger.
No.  No.
And you went home unannounced, too?
Jesus.
What happened?
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
Ja?
It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
No.
A what kind of doctor?
Still lives with his mother.
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
I didn't know that.
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
What are his symptoms?
You're taking Mom out tonight?
My father!
He isn't?
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
That's something I suppose.
Did you see him?
A what?
I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.
Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool.
This is very good for us.
What kind of a life is that?
It's suicide!
Every night, Penelope, for the past two years, I've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight.
Why would you do that?
To show myself how brave I am.  The issue's in doubt, you know--since I'm always for peace--
We've got to rescue him.
Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
We have enough for a shuffleboard team.  In Heaven, shuffleboard is everything.  Hitler plays shuffleboard.
Apparently your friend has gone into Mexico. A Border Guard responded to the APB. How does it feel to have the L.A.P.D. doing your work for you?
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
You're still dressed?
What?
Now, what do you want?
What's that shade of blue called?
Yes. I think it'll look better.
No.
Do you know where she lives?
Where is she?
Something like that. How much do you make?
You're not a private detective either, are you?
I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
How important do you think sex is?
What the crap?
He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.
Out of gratitude for being chosen. That's where Grace comes in. God first chooses you, then allows you, by Grace, to choose Him of your own free will.
You really believe all that?
It's not quite the same thing.
Where does he live.
Hey, I'm a private detective, Van Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them.
Do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?
But this is my apartment.
Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
You know, it's possible to buy anything on this earth. You can buy child whores, slaves. You can have people raped, killed...  One of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named Ratan. He usually isn't in this country.  How'd you hear about him?
Just leave me alone.
Is Marsha there?
How's your business, Jake?
Jake?
How did you find me?
Wes, do me a favor.
What?
Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.
God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing.
Where is she? Where is the girl?
No.
Who told you about this?
I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.
You wait here. I'll find out where she is.
Fifty cents admission.
It's a short film.
I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store?
I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.
Here. Take your fifty cents back.
Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.
What exactly do you have in mind?
Not exactly...
Don't get me wrong. A couple years ago, I woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. But the Lord's been good to me. I can now finance any films I choose. Big ones, small ones. Right now we're setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film. Live sound. I like to keep my own money in my films. That way you don't have to share the profits. There's plenty of guys in town that'll take it, though. But if I was you, Mr... what was your name again?
Sounds all right.
What's that?
He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
Maybe. Maybe not.
No, Andy. Don't know the kid.
I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
Isn't this your vehicle?
Officer, I can explain.
Not very.
What do you see?
Eh, no. Thank you.
How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
Nice to meet you.
Do you dance?
Eh, no.
Yes.
Yearse!
What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
It's very interesting.
She's very sweet, but so old- fashioned. Please sit down, Harold. I'll put on the kettle and we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.
I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
Me! No. Of course not.
It goes on and on.
Well, it's all very thrilling, of course, but I ask you, Harold... Is it enough?
What happened?
Why not?
Oh, my. We're too late.
What is that he's working on?
He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
No more revolts.
Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together.
I think he's following us.
He's stopped.
Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.
Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
You are the wisest person I know.
Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars are shining right now. We just can't see them. Just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.
Well, why don't you?
It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. "Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can."
I've never met her. My mother set it up.
That wasn't very scary.
Do you think there is any life up there?
We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
Why are there no photographs in these frames?
Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
Farewell?
Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
But why now?
But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me.
I have a sore throat.
Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?
Mother.
Fay, I'll call you back.  What did you say?
I suppose you think this is very funny, Harold.
Fifteen.
Yes. It does.
No.
Why?
I'd have liked to talk to him.
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.
It's the greatest excitement in the world.
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
How about hand-to-hand combat?
Well, I don't...
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
Souvenirs?
Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
Eh, yes, ma'm.
Oh yes. That's fine.
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
Well, well. All my family together again. How very sweet.
Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!
I... I had a visitor.
No bad dreams.
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
Kyle, you don't have...
What are you talking...
Wait!
No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.
They were over here, Professor.
Remind me why I keep doing this.
That's all for you, Sammy.
Cordon off the area. Something came through.
There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
C'mon -- Rasputin??
Me?? C'mon --
How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
It's her choice --  She's human --
How does he know so much about me?
Where am I -- exactly, Sir?
As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
Oh, Jesus!! Hellboy -- ?? Is real --
But not everyone was so lucky.  Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive the night. You're reckless.
In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
Those things never work. Never.
Thank you.
Myers?
You better have that looked at.
No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
Strong.
A brute.
Yes, I --
Look, do you want the bed in or not?
We're leaving.
Julia's my second wife.
Lucky man.
It's just a puzzle box.
Julia!
Don't touch me. Or so help me --
Bastard.
You're Julia, right?
Oh.
But you said --
Julia.
Who?
Ssh. Don't want babe to hear.
Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some?
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
You would be. They tore me apart.
They took my body, but my spirit... they left that here. In the boards, in the walls. Watching the world, but not able to TOUCH it.
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
Hi. I got soaked.
Which is where?
Like who?
Just a thought --
It smells damp.
So what's the argument?
Are you all right?
Just feeling a bit sick.
Maybe a brandy.
Don't go upstairs.
Plain soda?
I... suppose so, yes.
No, not much.
Let's keep it that way, shall we?
You're awake. Good girl.
I'm afraid you'll have to wait until the police have spoken to you. Keep trying your father; he'll answer eventually.
Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?
I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.
You will keep in touch.
Surprise.
What are you drinking, love?
Yeah.
It's like she's waiting for something.
Finished?
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
Oh no.
As long as you don't mind the smell of fur --
Steve. Thank God you came.
What's wrong?
I'll come back later, huh?
Do I know you?
Really.
Rob.  Rob Gordon.  Circa junior high...
Don't you want to hear what's next?
Oh, so what's the point then?
Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal.
What did he ever do to you?
What are you snickering about?
Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash.
Ehh.
-- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --
I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here.  I don't understand any part of this conversation.  You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen.  What am I supposed to say?
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
Un-fucking-believable.  Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all.
Shut the fuck up, Barry.
Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?
Isn't it?
What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.
Great.  Can I have it then?
Nothing.
Your desert island top-five.
Is there a difference?
Can I go home and work this out and let you know?  In a week or so?
What's his name?
"Music for Old People." What does that mean?
Okay. "Dance Music For Old People?"
Yeah.  A billion.  Right... How are you?
Uh...yes, at the moment.
No, that's okay.  Really.
So.  Where have you been staying for the last week?
I'm sorry.  I haven't been very fair to you.  That's why I came here to the store this evening.  I feel terrible, Rob.  This is really hard, you know.
What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
What were the others?
What?
Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right?  It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it?  It means he might live.  Even if it's only a remote possibility.
Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around?
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
Is that why you wanted to see me?
Nothing.
It's me.
I'm sure.
You still together?  Going all right?
I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?
You're being deliberately obtuse.
You're soaking.
What do you want to do?
What?
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
No, but...
Where?
I'm sorry I've been acting like a jerk.  I do appreciate what you've done for me, and I know you've done it for the best possible reasons, and I do love you, even though I act like I don't.
Are you going to talk to me, or shall I get my paper out?
Rob here.
Hey.  It's Liz.
How're you holding up?
Enough of what?
For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
I'm sure it isn't.
I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
That way.
How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out.
Seventy-five.
Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
I'm Vince.
I can't figure out why he's doing it. He's been Richard Taupin at least since 1967.  And the guys rich.  You should see the stuff he has in that shop.
P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
He'd want to know about all this.
Scottish claymore.  Take a French epee, add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business, and you've got a claymore.
That stuff'll put you away if you're not careful.
You're very macabre.
He was unsual.
There was this one fella.  Asked a lot of questions.  I was out of town but I heard he spent near a full day in the records office.
This is against the rules.
Do you play?
It's not mine.
Grave robbers?
Why not?
I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
You did kill those men.
You make it all sound so simple.
No.  So what now?  We just wait?
I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
Come here, Brenna.
What is it like?  Being you?
It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
It will be horrible.  The future.  I may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows. I can promise you nothing.  Nothing but a moment.  Maybe two.  But a moment of love, is that not worth a lifetime?
Forget it.
I'm just curious.
I'm calling an attorney.
Four?
You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.
But we might just give it the 'ole college try.  What with the court back ups, it could be days before you got an arraignment. But then, I'm sure the flunk-out neice of the D.A. knows all about that.
What makes you so sure he's the one?
What were you doing in Felton?
Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
Come on Brenna, your ass is already in a sling, don't drag me into it.
Requiem acer'nam donaei-
Aye.
I was driven out.
How can you know this?
Hmm, que rico.  What is it you call this?
You're a long way from Inverness.
He told me there could be only one.
Listen to me.  Hear the words.
This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
How can I stop such a man?
Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!
Go to hell.
I am not ready for this.
Please not be touching me, Conor.
Something pretty.
That's wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it?
Who am I deceiving?
Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you.
Second musketeer.
I understand you joined up in Bremen.
My father taught me.
Where!
How did you find me?
Tradition.
I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.
Nothing to be sorry about.
This is Murphy. More slop on the hanging.
I said -- uh -- I said even ten minutes -- is a long time -- to be away from you.
Oh, it isn't like that.
He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake.
Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
All right, dear.
Yes, wasn't it?
BRUCE!! How'd you get out?
I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours.
I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin!
But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me.
Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
How long would the interview take?
Well, I'm independent, too.
No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office. 
Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
Oh, this is all right, Bruce. I just wanted to be sure.
If you've any accusations to make, Hartman, make them in the proper manner. Otherwise, I'll have to ask you to get out.
Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars.
I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense.  And you'll be an accessory!
You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling your nose out of the feed bag.
I haven't any hard feelings.
Listen, Walter --
Dead?
There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless --  Hildy!
Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
Bermuda... Rich, eh?
What's his line?
Then what does he want with you?
You wouldn't believe this, Walter, but Bruce holds the door open for me.
The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town.
What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act!
All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition.
It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.
Not if he's inside the desk. We'll carry the desk over.  Give me Duffy!
Huh!
Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey -- or is that libelous?
Hildy!
What did you do with her?
Look at me, Hildy --
Hello -- hello...
Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?
I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now!
When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
Don't open that!
Wait a minute!  Let go there!
Murder, uh?
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
Anything you want, Boss.
I'm busy, Duffy.
The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the scum of modern civilization.
You said it!
A joint interview, eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor.
Are you gentlemen all through with me?
So -- now I say to you: 'Earl Williams, you are under arrest!' and you point your gun at me.
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around.
She says she's gonna write fiction.
So have we!
Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
Gus, this --
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.
Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
For who?
Did you actually give Williams that gun?
Now, listen, Fred. Just give me a few hours before you make any decisions. I'll get results. I'm doing everything humanly possible. I've just sworn in four hundred deputies.
Pete, you're through!
Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
Fine work, Pete! You certainly delivered the goods. I'm proud of you.
And so do I!
Fine, thanks, Sheriff.
Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better.
Look out, you --
Huh?
I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
Any dope yet on how he got out?
Isn't that her picture?
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.
Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
They'll get him! They'll get him!
Are you all right, now?
The what?
But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
Get out of here!
Williams put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered --
Baldwin -- his name is.
Who? Hildy Johnson? She just stepped out. She'll be back in a second. Who? Oh, Mr. Baldwin. Well, if you'll hang on a minute, she ought to be right in. All right. 
Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself.
You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.
This is going too far, young man.
Well go on then. You can't join if you can't answer.
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Tell them about Pauline's mum.
It's easy. I've done it.
I did see them. I did.
You're the biggest fibber.
Can't we just see the end?
They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8.
Take it away. I know your husband's been away a long time, but....
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
You expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring? And you'll meet some French girl who can speak your own language. No thank you!
Why not?
There was talk of planting some when we first came.
And absent bridegrooms!
No Turks.
Why didn't they say that before you started?
This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.
I won't have this vulgar talk in my house.
You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
You're having me on, Molly.
Yikes.
Oh, I know. I'll show you where it's at, sweetie. Aren't you just so cute all bundled up like a cinnamon roll of Christmas love.
The lions were totally covered in this guy's blood... I think they ate his face off, tore open his rib cage, pulled his legs off... it was a wild scene.
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
What about R.J.?
Aw, I was going home to my Mamma's house... yeah, I was out doing this thing.
How much further?
Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows?
A dead one.
I was just wondering.
You all having a Halloween party tonight?
I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
Come on, bro. Let's go.
What's this?
Yeah, I was never that big of a western fan. I like science fiction.
You see me and my friends are writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions. You know all the crazy shit you see when you drive cross country.
Y'all find us country people real funny like don't ya... well, God damn pack up the mule and sling me some grits, I'ze a gotta get me some schooling.
Really? Huh, I thought for sure you'd say Lynette Fromme. She's got that snooty vibe I know you dig.
She's pretty cute.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
Don't panic yourself, way too much caffeine guy... I see a sign.  Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen and Monsters... cool. Also... fried chicken and... gasoline... next exit.
I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see if it's worth thinking about.
She looks like she stinks.
Almost there.
We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.
I hope to Christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things.
And...
Christ, ain't they all. All them retards wanna do is fuck and eat.
That's nice.
What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
So what?
Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us.
Really, now is not the time to make waves.
That was good babe, just keep doing that.
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
A couple hours!
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
Sorry.
Doing what? Messy up your day? Well, fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand... than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit!
Where is he?
Please, just a minute.
Think... do any of these kids look familiar in any way?
That's true, Otis... not that we're having a bad time, but...
We gotta break it open.
I guess not.
And?
Not at all.
I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
Oui.
It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
Hmmmph.
You have to choose Nathan. It's like Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's choice. Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice? It is like that. Only it is this.
Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
You were wonderful today, darling. Such authority with the ape-man boy. It made me so hot for you.
Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?
So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
Lila?
That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous.
We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it.
God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.
Yeah?
No maid service! For God's sake, can't you read the fucking "do not disturb" sign on the fucking doorknob?
Nathan told my brother.
I'll be in touch.
I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing.  I've been seeing someone. A therapist.
You are a therapist, right?
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
Yes, and...
I like you, too, Nathan.
You do?
Do you? Oh do you, darling?
Yes, darling.
Of course.
Yes, darling.
Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
Who is it?
Who from work?
It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.
I'm trying, you know.  I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what you want.
Really?
That's great.
Really?
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
Look at you two. You both disgust me.
Ounpoo. Ungh.
Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?
So anyway, that's the nightmare I've been having lately.
I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
Pittsburgh?
About sixty, seventy bucks.
You sure you going to be comfortable enough there, Miss... ah... ?
What makes you know so much? How do you know what Eddie was thinking?
You know what's good for him?
How?
Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?
I'm sure Mr. Felson knows what he's doing. Certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out.
Have you noticed, Bert? This fellow here bears a striking resemblance to you. It seems as though you might have modeled for the artist.
How much do I owe you?
I lost twenty bucks.
Maybe he knows how to drink.
A thousand.
How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.
For me.
How much you think you're worth these days? I'm puttin' up the money, I'm puttin' up the time. For that I get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you win.
Hi. How's business?
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
Man named Turk Baker?
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.
Here, I got it.
I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
I'll beat him the next game.
I got time, Bert.
What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
What's your game? What do you shoot?
Yeah, that's right.
He's my partner.
Just tell me where I can find him, friend.
Ten grand. I'm gonna win ten grand in one night.  ...Well, who's gonna beat me? C'mon, Charlie, who's gonna beat me?
How much we got?
Aah! I've got no stomach for that any more. I've had that kind of life.
I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.
My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
Ah, that's unfortunate, Mr. Felson.
Yeah, sure has.
Hey, I'll tell you what -- I'll play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in my pocket.
You're a pretty good player.
How much are you ahead?
What bus?
That wouldn't give us much time, would it?
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
How come you didn't catch your bus?
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
You talk kind of funny, but I like it.
What time is it?
Why?
Well, I believe you when you say you go to school.
You want to go with me?
Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday.
Eddie, what's in that case?
It's a machine gun. This guy told me when I came to the big city I'd have to have a machine gun, so I bought one.  Where do you get the money? To pay for all this? I mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?
Would he know?
Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
Nothin'.  Want another drink?
No, I want to walk.
Where's Bert?
Well, what's the matter?
Is that a fact?
Well, you shoot big-time pool, Fats. I mean, that's what everybody says, you shoot big-time pool. Let's make it two hundred dollars a game.
Your shot.
That's what the game's all about.
How much do you remember?
I only protect myself -- !
What do you want?
What's inside?
Emma...
I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that?
The more we plant, the more that'll grow, and the happier --
Need some gas?
You built things.
Bathroom?
Wow.  Look at the mountains.
Which one's that?  The dull, red one.
I had an awful dream.
We'll be by to pick him up in ten minutes.
He was upset with moving, I believe.
They'll get us.
Does it look to you like anything landed here?
You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?
What're you talking about?
Okay, why did I just send my family to Atlanta?
Can't this thing go any faster?
They don't know this.
I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook...
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
Get us out of here!
We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir.  If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency! You knew all about this. When were you planning on informing the rest of us!?
How do you know?
You can't go. Call them back.
Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
Yes, I am.
No. Exotic.
I shouldn't have left her.
It's all fuzzy.
How' he doing?
But, Mr. President...
And before here?
Many worlds...
Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.  Run!
May we go home now, please?
All your life.
Do you believe the Grail actually exists?
But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith.
Schneider?
Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.
Doctor Jones?
You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.
What's that?
Don't wander off.
My room!
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Swastika.
Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa. Give me your other hand, honey. I can't hold you.
Out!
I'll never forgive myself --
Found it.
Will you take it easy!
Dad!
All right Dad -- tell me.
Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.
What did you get?
I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that sentiment.
Dad, how can you?
Nice landing.
If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
Captain Blumburtt and his troops are here to check up on the "natives".
Hard to believe, isn't it...?
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
I had a question, Mr. Prime Minister. I was examining some of the Maharajah's artifacts.
Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
No.
There were five stones in the beginning. Over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you...
You will go to palace there.
What evil?
Siam.
The old man saw it in a dream.
What'd he say now?
Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
Just one arm!
That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?
I'm going down.
I want to go home...
Indy? Did you talk to them?
Anymore ideas...?
Give me your hat...
...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus
Arrrgh!
You're in my head? You don't know my name?
What street?
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
...I need to make a phone call.
No.
Why not?
Behind us?
I wouldn't say that.
Calm Down! Act rational.
I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance.
I am. You are.
You're the one talking to a little guy in your head.  ...We'll have to do it on our own.
What do you mean we.
Thanks.
Find You?
Corridor A.
I'm at the airport.
Eating sushi?
What? What do you mean?
She's...pretty fast.
You're beautiful..
Wait.
Touch her.
To the hotel. To register.
Much too blue.
I don't know what's going on.
They're all in it.
Maybe she's telling the truth.
You're doing great with her.
Not her. You!
It's embarrassing.
It's not your time. I get time off.
Osaka.
On what?
`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.
One of your instincts?
It's him.
This may hurt.
What exactly?
Not really. Truth is...I was ..jealous. Of you.
JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
Oh, I can't.
I didn't do anything.
It's a long story.
Impossible.
Enough ROmance.
It may have been affected.
Do what?
Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
What?
And you, there are many places to get away. Why here?
Just give me the keys.
What did you say?
No. No one to speak of.
Wait. What's your name?
As if your mind's not all there.
I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
Who else is interested in me?
Your friends, did they ask about me?
Were you working for him last night?
He didn't.
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
We're very close.
Get us one.
Why'd you ask him.
So do I.
This going to work?
I can't fly it.
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
What did you tell them?
Who are you? Who do you work for?
You are, I've seen you.
That's twenty feet high.
Why'd you invite me here?
A drink...
Why?
I can't get it out. It would take hours.
This the only spare?
So we better get started.
Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
What's that outside, Daddy?
Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
Yes, baby?
How long?
Shit...
Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
Since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on "60 Minutes"?
You're taking "no" for an answer?
No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?
A gun? Yes.
What caliber is my gun?
Is there any more rice...?
I didn't want to leave it there...
I don't understand.
...taping?  What are you taping?
Did you say Berman?
...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
They're killing the Wigand interview...
It would be better if he called us.
He referred to this... the Seven Dwarfs...
Hardly new news.
Oh, man.
I discovered this. SEC filing...  For the sale of the CBS Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.
Lowell.
Oh, lots.
I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver.
Far as you go where?
Did work.
This is my house... In front of my wife, my kids?! What business do we have?
And, I'm unemployed. So I have to protect my medical coverage.  ...so I left them a message this morning. Their expanded confidentiality agreement? I will sign it.
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
Next to your father?
You charge by the hour?
My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
No.
I heard.
I don't know how to say this, Jeff, except to just say it right out, so I'll say it. They do not want to air it.
Alright... the ABC Telemarketing Company?
I've got to teach class. I've got to go. I've got to teach class.
What?
Alright, now listen to me. I want you -- I want you to tell him, in these words: get on the fucking phone...!
I can't say that!
Well, no, look... I mean, there was a footprint. Forget it. It's probably not important at all.  You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry.  So, what were you calling about?
And, so, I moved out... I see the girls a couple of days a week...
Where you staying now?
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
Right.
You're gonna get your fix...
Poor communication skills.
"I would bet on it."
Jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind. Most people consider what they're saying... social skills... Jeffrey just charges right ahead.  Now, I know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with Brown & Williamson, Jeff...
That's why we hire scientists...
Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve?
...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it --
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment.
Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.
What the hell is Botox?
Thanks, buddy.
You have the pre-nup?
I'm sorry to hear that. But you weren't close, were you?
No.
Well. He said to "make the house mine."
Why would you be here?
Have you ever been married, Miles?
You just haven't met the right person.
He wants a reconciliation.
Gotcha.
No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
To victory.
Hello?
Me. Yes.
I want to be your -- your wife.
Huh?
Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce hearing?
But?
Here's my card. Spend as much as you want. We get mileage.
Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
It's a no go, Joe.
You were going to have this thug...?
Marylin. Run. I'll distract him.
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
Rex. Go away. I don't want to have to sic the dogs on you.
Hello, Rex.
Marylin.
Do you think he set me up? Do you think that was his intention?
Nothing specific, but I'll have my own place soon.
My client has ruled that out.
My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick --
Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
Did Marylin end up with money?
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
Mm.
You know what I mean when I say "it."
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
Video.
Nothing?
What's Kirshner?
What are they?
She owes me a meal.
Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
I've put extra men on, all along the way.
don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in—
What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!
Here you are.  Do you mind if I ask you something frankly?  Do you love my daughter?
Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because—
You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat!
South America.
South America!
Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull.
Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
I don't know very much about him.  Except that I love him.
I suppose so.
On a hunger strike, huh?  When'd she eat last?
Been sending her meals in regularly?
What about that diamond wrist watch she had on—she can raise some money on that?
You've made that quite evident—with all your threats of annulment.  Well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute. Ellie and I got married because we love each other. And she's proving it; as far as I'm concerned there's going to be no annulment.
Personally, I think it's stupid!  But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object.
Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
Me? Forget it, son.  I got millions.
Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil?  "My tonsils won't burn— As life's corners I . . .
Hey, whadda you tryin' to do—kid me?
Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
That storm sure made a mess outa these roads.
What happened?
Remember me? I'm the fellow you slept on last night.
My ticket?
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
I never thought of that.
Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.
Here, boy!
Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but— you've been very kind. 
I have an idiosyncrasy all my own. You'll notice my coat came first—then the tie—then the shirt—now, according to Hoyle,[5] the pants should come next. But that's where I'm different.  go for the shoes first. After that I—
Nope. No complaints.
Must be the Spring.
I thought maybe—uh—"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
No. No. It's too good a story.
Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.
We could start a two-person stock company. If things get tough—we can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]
I refuse to resign!
I was never built for these moonlight strolls.  Why did we have to leave the bus?
It takes money to buy food.
Aren't you afraid of me?
Of course it is.
Your father didn't know beans about "piggy-back" riding.
Well, take them off.
I don't want it now.
There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.
You think it's simple, huh?
Oh, no!
Here comes a car!
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?[13]
Any luck?
I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
There's a man here to see you, Sweetheart.
Sorry—I didn't mean to—
Hey—you not up yet? Come on—come on!
The old man's screwy!
Get out of here!
What's the thousand bucks for?
Huh?
You're drunk.
When you sober up—come in and see me.
Yeah.
If you ask me, I don't believe they're married.
They're married all right. I just seen the license.
They made me get 'em a rope and a blanket, on a night like this.
He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
See that. They're gone!
I'd like to sit with my—uh—wife—if you don't mind. 
Thanks. 
It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame, you know what I'd do?
What?
I'd go fifty-fifty with you .
Cause I'm a guy that don't believe in hoggin' it, see?  A bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball,[10] is what I always say.
Sh-sh-sh—! Soft pedal, you mug!—before I— What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thing—and you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
No.
Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man?  We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.
So you saw Oswald how many times?
Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared.  And yet the Commission found you, Dean.
Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home.
Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination?  Just goes to show, you can never know about some people.  Am I right, Jack?  Well, bless my soul.  Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack.  Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here.  Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side.
I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan.  Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia.  That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it.  As a direct result, the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.  I can't help thinking of that book Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn't want the Peace Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that.  It gets weirder.
Bill.
So why does he call himself Bertrand?
Lord, wake me, please.  I must be dreaming.
The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.
He had his palm print on the weapon.
I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.
Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want.
Dave, I always play square.  No bugs. I'd love you to go on the record, but I"m in no hurry.  Whenever you're ready.
No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
But the boys told us they didn't get any.
Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car.  Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?
Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
Was it the same Oswald, Dave, that was in Dallas, or was it an impersonator.
And Shaw?
But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy.
No, because there were others.  There were admirals.
Daddy said it was all right if I was real quiet.
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
These new people never identified themselves.  They musta been watching the whole thing 'cause they knew everything Mary and me had been doing that day.  I guess I wasn't too hard to find - wearing that red raincoat.
That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say.
The next thing we know he's living in Dallas/Ft. Worth in October '62 working 6 months at Jaggars-Chiles- Stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the U.S. Army... He starts work only days before the government reveals Russian missiles in Cuba and the crisis explodes.  Oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works alongside a young man who'd been in the Army Security Agency.
The Oswalds are introduced by George de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill Williams.  It's through Janet Williams in October '63 that Lee gets the warehouse job, right smack on Elm Street at the Book Depository, which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence.
Not at all.  But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other.  That is precisely the point of a long dining table.  The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.
After dinner you paid him to have sex with you.
Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you?
Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?
Mr. Shaw, did you ever meet Lee Harvey Oswald?
You really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters, don't you, Mr. Garrison.
Please answer the question.
It says that this company has heavily Fascist ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.
I've spent half my life in the United States military serving and defending this great country, Mr. Shaw, and you're the first person I ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president.
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
Honey, in all my years in the service I never knew a single man who was given a Russian test.  Oswald was a radar operator.  He'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas.
Tough day.
How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!
Honey, come on.  The government wants you to be scared.  They want everybody to be scared to speak out.  They count on it.  But there's nothing to be scared of.
Well so do I, goddammit!  So do I! I had a life too, y'know - I had a life, too.  But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!  It's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and "I'm jes fine honey."  While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies!  Well, I'm not "fine" about that, I'm angry. My life is fucked, Liz!  And yours is, too!  And if you don't want to support me I can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away.
They killed him, honey.
You realize the things you're saying, Willie, are going to be attacked by a lot of different people.
Bill, Lou, we're standing in the heart of the United States Government's intelligence community in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there, the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time?
Time?
Chief, I've had my doubts about Bill for a long time.  He's fighting everything.
If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day.  You been duck hunting?  I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy.  What'd he say?  "I'm just a patsy."  Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me.
Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry.  It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.  But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison - they want the hard evidence!  They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is another type of threat, I don't...
No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.
Just think... just think.  What happened to our country .. to the world...  because of that murder... Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier...
Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?
I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
Well, believe what you want, boss, but we got to be more careful.  All these new volunteers, any one of them could be...
I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.  On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops.
Yes?
Virginia.
Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
I think I'm gonna just get this for today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would you mind ringing this up while I change out of it?
I understand.
Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?
That's not what they're tellin' me.
What?
What's the problem?
Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
I'd say there's about, oh, fifty thousand dollars here. What would you say Ray?
What's going on?
What's she want?
Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
Help yourself.
But now you're telling us now you do.
You don't want much, do you?
I can give you a lift home if you'd like?
I thought you might want a drink?
What's your brand?
But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation.  How 'bout another?
You know who put the dope in your bag?
Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that.
They wanted you to tell them what you know.
That's him. How do you know 'em?
Ordell pick up his bond?
Whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my problem. I gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble. I'm off today, but if I can't leave the country I'm out of a job. And if I don't got a job, I can't hire a lawyer.
Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.
You never got into the whole CD revolution?
'76?
'74, I think.
Are you?
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.
What'd ya see?
"American President"
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
I see.
A half-a-million dollars will always be missed.
What do you do when he comes home?
You do that?
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
How'd you find out?
All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the case. I'm their witness. They wouldn't have a case without me. If it's his word against mine, who are they gonna believe?
Madrid or Barcelona?
You know what's in the bag you're taking?
He say is a surprise.
Oh, Miss Brown?
We can look into that.
How can you help us?
Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.
She didn't say.
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
We could, if I'm not in jail.
That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much.
After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
Where's the bag she gave you?
She didn't give me one. I told you before, Melanie wasn't part of the plan. Ordell must of told her to do it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping bag, and takes off. What am I supposed to do, go after her? I'm in my fucking underwear. I had to get dressed before I could do anything. So I put this back on 'cause could put this on faster than I could my uniform.
There was a guy with Melanie?
What about you?
Killian's.
Better get me another Sam's.  Join me in a Jaeger shot?
He said he didn't know about it.
Kinda.
Dreaming.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.
They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before...
Who?
What'd you care?
She don't know shit about the money.
So you come out with her Robinson's/May bag, go meet Sheronda. Simone peeks out, waits for my man Louis here to give her a signal nobody's watchin'. She leaves the store, gets in her car -- mission accomplished.
Susanville.
What for?
No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.
Were you a disco guy?
He killed a man worked for him the other night.
That's not what I'm saying at all.  You know where he went?
No.
I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?
Is it this aisle, Lou-is?
This one.
Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
Uh-huh.
Naw, man. I just told you, I'm comfortable. I ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. You bring your ass out here.
That was Beaumont.
He put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did.  And if you know Beaumont, you know there ain't no way in hell he can do no ten years. And if you know that, you know Beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it ain't gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. You think I'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? Shit, you better think again. 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em.  Understand what I'm sayin'?
How much is there?
You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where they got all them car dealerships. We're gonna leave this heap in a parking lot and get one the cops don't know about.  Hey, where's Melanie?
Fuck you for asking me that.
I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?
Do you know what he's on probation for?
Haven't a clue.
She is an airline stewardess. Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow. They set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what I was thinkin', you could use the ten thousand you owe me from Beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess.
They fuckin' wit' her. They callin' it Possession with Intent. A black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her, they call that shit Intent. Same shit happened to a movie star. It's Possession.
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
You still there?
What the fuck you doin' knockin on the door like the goddamn police? You lookin' to get shot?
I thought you might be asleep.
I'm alone.
All I did was walk out with it.
And where's Jackie?
Have her bring the money here.
It's in the safe. She can't get at it.
Call her, tell her the combination.
She's all alone.
You sure?
He leave town?
What are you then?
I'm alive.
Let me out of here!
What do you want?
Just to see you. That's all.
Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.
It's short, huh?
Wait ... Daddy.
Don't go.
You mind? I'm eating, huh?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
What do you mean, demons?
We should get ourselves a lawyer.
Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.
She told you that?  Did she tell you about the $2,000 I'm still paying for the orthodontist? I'll bet she didn't mention that.
Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love, Jake.
What?
From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.
I was in Hell. I've been there. It's horrible. I don't want to die, Louis.
I've seen it. It's all pain.
There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ?
I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me.
It's not healthy with it closed.
What happened to you?
Jezzie, I can't see.
What?
Wait. Don't.
I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
What are you talking about? I'm freezing.
I know.
How come? The army?
He did? When?
He didn't give me a chance.  Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.
I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
Sit down, Jake.
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
Why won't you answer me?
I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten.
I'm tired.
Mid-town mostly.
Oh God!
I came up with the formula back in Nam but I never got a chance to use it.
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
I no from around here.
He'll never make it.
Speaking.
You're lucky. How many vets you know are even employed?
Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
When the left hull goes, so will the right.
You see that?
Everyone okay?
Hey! I'm not ready.
Thorgan, suit up.
I'd say we have about ten minutes tops.
I am an expert!
Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!
How do you know that piece of cursed rock down there doesn't carry something metal tits can't detect?
Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
Wait a minute...I need...
Not a chance.
Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to Lab two and cover out backs.
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?
Give me a break! What happened?
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
Where are you going?
What if you miss?
That's really funny.
Okay?!!
They're not gonna make it. Close the door before he gets us all.
I'm gonna spew.
You think it killed . . .  Yeah, I guess not.
Hurry! She's lost it!
Kay-em 14.
Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie...
Ow!
How do you know?
Something's wrong.
The power's back up!
Then open the doors!
Guys, please come with me!
Hockey player? He's not a ...
It's my charter. My party.
C'mon. Middle appendix --
He's comin' up -- !
I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers.  Ship it.
Be careful.
It's three feet deep, Martin
It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.
Home... New York?
Got a pen on you?
There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater.
What? What?!
There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater.
You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.
A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it!
I just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there.
What the hell?
Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.
You here for the summer?
Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs?
We're not even sure what it was.
You love sharks?
Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut?  Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there -- a portable shower?
Let it go, don't waste your time.
Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White.
Sick vandalism! Brody, that's a deliberate mutilation of a public service message! I want those little paint-happy bastards caught and hung up by their baby Buster Browns!
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.
Really? What are they like?
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
We're getting a stretch limo.
You're mad. Why are you mad?
No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.
Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?
Just like our moms and teachers!
What? I'm not made of stone.
You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
Juno? Did you happen to barf in my urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one I got up in Stillwater? I found some weird blue shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning.
Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now.
They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
We don't even have a dog!
Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I get that Spinal Tap thing?
Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds.
What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
What is that, Mahogany? What happens if you crack the neck?
Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here.
Why aren't you at work?
Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
I know what junk is.
It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was?
I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.
Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here.
Why? What the big deal?
I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.
I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
Consider it your musical education.
Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.
I actually know this one.
Yeah, this song's older than me, if you can believe that. I danced to it at my senior prom.
I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
Oh, hi Juno. How are you?
Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
Mark? Why is Juno crying?
Okay, this is no laughing matter.
You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
Well, well. If it isn't MacGuff the Crime Dog! Back for another test?
Maybe you're having twins. Maybe your little boyfriend's got mutant sperms and he knocked you up twice!
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?
I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
Well, maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads. I see them all the time in the Penny Saver.
Aw, please Junebug?
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.
Keith's hot.
Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
What do you make with that?
What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.
Looks like it, yeah.
...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years.
I'm cool.
What's this?
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
Happy birthday Adele.
I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
Thank you for what?  What are you thanking me for Adele?
Walter Livesy.
You gonna talk to the people who did those murders?
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
This the book your writing?
Yeah.
...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.
...and?
...just like that?
So how's it going?
I like that.
I still think we should have met them first.
...And all I'm saying is I think we ought to try and get along with them. That's all.
Where's Adele?
You were plenty hot.
...Janitor's job.
...Diebold?
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
Yes. Altogether.
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
What do you think?
Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
How?
And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cute when you were little.
That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen.
She's probably smash you in the fucking face.
What for? That guys a dick.
I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.
I wanna fuck Darcy.
She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her.
Why I give pennies?
Nah.
Man we fucked him up.
No I'm serious. Can I suck your tit? Either of you guys. I don't care.
What?
Nuffin' G. Just forget it.
Sup. Sup.
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
Tonight?
Come on. It'll be fun. We'll just bug out. There should be a bunch of people. It'll be fun I promise.
I just know. I know you'll love it.
I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about.
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
Yeah.
You think I want a baby? When you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff.
Jennie. You've tested positive for the HIV infection.
Yeah.
Because gee, you don't look OK. I mean you're a very beautiful young lady. It's just that you look troubled that's all...
Yeah, I guess so.
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there.
I'm fucking serious. Where's Telly?
Passion...
That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore.
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
Who, Benny's little sister?
Yep.
Yeah I get bored.
I hate 'em.
So that's why Casper is how he is.
Hello?
What are you guys doing?
To come?
What man? What is it?
We seem to have a little problem here?
I think you're lying.  That's what kind of problem.
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it.  You think I'm right?
The door was open.
I used to.  With my old man.  He taught me how to hunt and trap.  Trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields.  When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  But they're crafty little devils.  You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  You ever smell Raccoon scent?  Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy.  He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it.  You know why?  Cause he can't help himself.  The scent drives him.  So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
You got it on the board.
You want me to what?
Local?
How is she?
She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.
What is it?
It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.
Oh, c'mon.  We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we?  It doesn't mean anything.  It's Sanderson!
That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
You don't want to think and that's why I'll win!  I'm already two points ahead.
Because she's the type.
I'm sure there are other people who would be interested in what I have to say.
How?
I used a variation.  You should have anticipated that.  Have you figured out the message?
Yes?
Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds.  It's check, Peter.
Naw, it's all fixed.  I also loaded up a program that'll analyze your games three hundred percent faster.
Nope.  Nothing.
Now what?
1985.  Hans Korshaud.
The police came to me for help.  What could I do?
You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
Why did he what?
Come here.
Is your dad here?
Do you like my dad?
I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
You ready?
Whaddaya got, Nolan?
How long has she been dead?
There's no blood.  Where's the fuckin' blood?
Only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to Sanderson for some case you're working on.  What'd he do?
No.  I told him to.  I wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end.
Maybe we should back up a minute and take a look at what we do have.  All the girls that have been killed have been killed at night.  They're all the same type.  All moved into their homes within the last three months -- and all of them found their homes through Homesearchers.
I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?
No.  He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist.  It was Peter.
Through a rental agency.
Here.  I played Gregory Lutz.
Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?
Maybe, but I don't think so.  I think it's just a tease.
Alright, c'mon Peter.  We're moving you to a cell.
On a variation, yes -- but it must be a variation that is unique.
About what?
She went into town with Mrs. Lutz.  Did they get him?
I can check and call you back.
How come you don't stay with them?
Sounds very violent.
--but you enjoy being the stronger one? You like the control.
Of course.
Why?
You know, you're not the easiest person in the world to get close to.
Wasn't I just talking about me?
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
What's wrong?
Peter, you have to admit--
Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.
It's not that easy.
That's worse.
You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...
You must move away from the Center.
Does the Queen live?
You have rope?
Reach out farther. Call to her.
You have not slept in two days.
You choose these?
What do you see?
I cannot reach her.
Can she be forced?
No. She must agree of her own free will.
I know the cruelty of such a fate.
I ache with it.
Once is enough, thank you.
You and I will guard the fire.
I don't think you'll grow careless.
They stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes.  Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all.
What kind of friend do you think I am?
Well, it is true that if I received a royal command I couldn't very well disobey it, could I?
Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing.
Can't I come, too?
A small house.
My heart stays here.
No.
I am Ergo the Magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision.
One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
Passable, pimple, very passable.
They'll trample him to death!
I do not want your worlds or your slaves.
These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
He will come for me.
It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
I will tell you something you did not know, Turold. Had it been my choice, all those years ago, I would have chosen you for my king. But my parents chose otherwise.
I knew.
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
You were attacked in the forest?
I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in.
The new King.
She has the power to kill.
She bore you many children?
You had a son.
It is no trickery.
Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
No.
...Not at all.
Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
Well, I don't need them...
It's not serious, it's just training. You have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
OK.
Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.
You were scared, weren't you?
...Shit!!  We'd found him. We waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window.
...Yes.
Nothing, for the moment.
Why did you unleash the pipe, I don't know?
Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
...OK... Good.
Messina.
Yes... Twice.
May we have this wolf's name and address?
And your store?  What about your new store?  What about all your dreams?
What?
What would you like us to do?
Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
Sergeant, I'm a psychologist and I know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems... My uncle lost his wife and it devastated him.
This is Indiana -- nothing's going to happen to you.
A wife?... Did someone piss drunk run into your wife?  Crushed her like a bug.  Snapped her bones?
What steps do we take now?
We operate.  We find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... I just did this procedure on a Senator and he's doing fine.
So what's the deal Maurice?
Yes -- you are.
I've seen it before.
It's a special day isn't it?
Is this going to be similar to the flower incident?
Yes.
A Book Society Award is a very prestigious thing.
You like to take walks?
It isn't going to make it Ellen. Let the poor thing go quietly.
Your father?
Mammoth.
This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens.
I'm walking there Kris.
The hairs on my arm are standing up... Something strange is happening.
... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.
You're walking to California?
Ellen told me that she didn't know if I loved her.
Tom Joad?
Come on Mr. Parker.
You're in pain.
... My father.
You're going to have a lot of work to do when I get back.
How are you feeling?
Hello!
That is, if you'll come to my room for an hour, I will give you five hundred dollars.
Umm. We can stay in the car for an hour if you want. But I really have to go then. It's your time.
A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
Do you want to fuck now?
To death?
I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you.
Is that really what you want to ask me?
I'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better.  Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something?
Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.
Sera you are crazy.
Because... it's better for me that way. OK?
Oh, and what did you do?
I warned you...  ...but I'm sorry.
Your color.
Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.
Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
There are limits.
I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?
So... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?
Right here at the hotel. Why?
I've been all right.
You have been lonely?
I'm pleased with you, Sera... how you have moved up in the world. I showed you a glamorous world when I took you off the streets...  and how you repay me.
Where have you been staying?
Have you told anyone that I'm here?
Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
I loved him!
I'll take that as a no.
He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
I'm sorry, but --
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
Yes?
Well, what am I supposed to do? He's engaged! She's got the family six- carat on her bony, unpolished finger.
You showed up Warner in class? You're supposed to be showing up Sarah.
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
You can't go home!
Our group is full.
What if -- you know -- it's not the night?
Did she do that to you, too?
Aside from that.
Mrs. Windham Vandermark?
It would be a full-service law firm, by and for blondes, providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas. I mean, think about it -- name one blonde intellectual role model.
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
He's gay! Enrique is gay!
I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
Almost.
You should. Do you have a resume?
She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted!
Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year.
It made me realize something. I'm an idiot.
In court. On opposing sides.
Are you serious?
What's the thing that always makes us feel better, no matter what?
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
But I'm hideous!
You're magnificent.
On the contrary!  The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting.  Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful.
God protect me.
Do it now!
No more... please...
And then?
What you do, boy?  You be velly solly, come here intellupt my sleep.
Friend Ogg.  Excuse our enthusiasm, occasioned as it was by a fondness for you.
Big question that, lad.  Why what?
Don't you know?
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
And who might that be?
So I'm to be a dragon-slayer, is that it?
We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
Aye!  That too.
Fine-looking army.
Beware.
How do we follow a raven we can't even see?
Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
Nay.  That's but to distract the casual visitor.  A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.
Make haste!  We've a hard day's march ahead.
God's blessing.
We'll trust in faith, Gump.
Why not admit it, Honeythorn Gump. We've lost our way entirely.
That's it!  The unbreakable line! We'll tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis... then, I'll climb up and chop down the drawbridge.
One more turn...
Aye.  We're good as inside.
Jack!  The courtyard's been taken... The Baron's forces are besieged in the south tower.  No sign of... Jack?  Do you hear what I'm saying? We've won, lad.
It doesn't matter.
Can you save her?
Sunlight, you say?
What weapon?
He's getting away!  He was at my mercy!
Keep me belly full, Jack.  Kill us another worm.
Barely living, from the looks of it.
Sweet slippers of Oisin!
Liar!
It's my father, gone a-hunting.  The Baron Couer de Noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport.
Stop complaining.
Shhh!
That's why he goes masked during the day...
You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!
I can't see a thing.
What's this now?
Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.
No!
As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom.
Were I a mortal girl, Jack, methinks I'd be in love with you.
Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
And charmed, of course.
And sweet?
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
Be fair, Oona.
Praise be to God.
Haven't heard a bird sing in days...
Oh, honey.  There's not much to do there. I mean, it's all work.
Mom said I should.
I put him to work.
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
He must.
Why?
You have to ask like that?
It's not what I was expecting.
You should stay.
Where's your dad?
I might not stay, anyway.
I'll get your back.
Yeah.
Why are you so uptight?
You're driving me crazy!  Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
He asked where you were!  He wants you with him.
He won't leave my room.
We've known each other since grade school.
Bob Larson.  Do you happen to have an unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a kitchen?
Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.
Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You'll have to explain that to the police.
You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
I know what the deal is.  Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.
I'll be around to check up on you.
You'll know me by the time we're through.
You don't have a choice.
And I don't take a shower in the middle of the yard.
I don't know.
I'm not even listening.
Do whatever you want with it.  I don't care.  All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
Nothing.
When you started first grade and your mom went to work, it was so she could save for an apartment.  But then she met Peter and skipped the idea of renting.
Getting high, I guess.
To hide a black eye.
I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
And you told Mom today?
I don't wanna go, Sam.
No.  A friend... your mother?  Everybody gets touched by someone they love.
Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.
Did Sam call to tell you he wouldn't be over this weekend?
What?
You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it.
How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...
I love those doors.
Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
I want him with me.
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
You've never said that before.
I kept thinking about it, what you said... I hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me.
I better get the kids home.
Nothing.
What's your deal with Alyssa?
I wasn't sure.
We've eaten.
Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
The biggest waste of time since television.
After the kids are back in school.
I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks.  Sam's working.  I told you Sam was working.  I mean, he really is.
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
I was talking about our marriage.
Despite you.
I never asked for more.
I hardly recognize you with a beard.
I thought I might be able to help, but it looks like you have all you can handle.
Do you know anything about building a house?
Run downstairs and give your dad a hug.
Dad's home, already?
They ain't men, Mae Rose. They're convicts. And nigger convicts to boot. Can you say nigger?
Nigger.
Don't take it so hard, Biscuit. She don't mean nothin' to him.
We played down in Jackson yesterday. Heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton.
Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you...
Yeah.
Take care of me?
I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.
I apologize, Claude. That was rude of me.
That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
Cool it, Ray. You're gonna get us in a lot of trouble.
Did you go see my cousin Maynard like I asked you in my letter?
Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
I've never seen you in here before.
I don't see where that's any of your business.
Where they taking us, anyway?
Come on, daddy-o. You haven't said a word since we started. Least you could do is make some friendly conversation.
Nothing.
Why didn't you take it?
So you mean, if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, I'd have to hype some square like you?
Nice meeting you? You've been here before, haven't you?
Reward?
He even got my daddy's watch.
Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
What do I want? What makes you think I want something?
On your behalf. What happened to we?
I know these trees all look the same, but I'm getting an awful familiar vibration from this one right here. You sure you know where we're going?
Absolutely. The map is very clear.
Don't mention it.
Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?
You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start.
God may have given it, but Claude Banks spotted it and nurtured it.
I'm not in the mood right now, Ray.
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
Don't shoot, sir. I can deal with this.  Ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot this white man. See, you do that, they'll kill you for sure. And it's not that I like you or anything, but I've kinda gotten used to having you around.
No, I'm gonna kill him --
I can't do it.
I said you're soft.
What do you expect? It's almost as old as we are.
Well, if you must know, they could be closer.
Alright, well, let's say you make it to Greenville. What's there, anyway?
He's from New York City. That one, too.
What are you doing here, mama?
Is everyone here?
Lemonade?
Besides, why bother with bootlegging when we got us a clear cut case of murder?
Who?
That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.
What's your name?
They'll be sending you up there soon enough. And not just for a visit, neither.
I'm interested. Keep talking.
Understood.
Let her go.
Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
I lowered the drinking age to ten.
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
Makin' friends already.
You did it for Namath.
Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
You're a good devil, Dad.
Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
Hey.
By she, do you mean he?
Easy, Liberace.
Sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time.
Did you check out the dragon mouth?
Looking for the chief.
No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
Hello.
It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
You think I'm a tourist?
If you want to.
Basically, yeah.
You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool.
Are you dead?
I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead.  Please tell me you like metal.
Nicky!
Do me.
Yes. What is rent?
Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
It looks like the work of a brother...
That just hurt a lot.
You callin' me a thief, my man?
I'm a Sandman!
Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go!
Answer the question!
All right. Now you keep your bargain.
It's a real privilege, Sandman.
I am.
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape.
I don't know what makes you so curious. You have any idea who his seed-mother was?
What the hell took you so long?
Why did you do that??!!
I'm Mary 2.
Well then...?
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
About what?
Thanks... but I have the choice.
I don't have much time.
I'd rather be with you.
I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us --  -- too fast
They won't believe us.
What do you suppose this was...?
I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
There's a Sanctuary... there is!
"Beloved son"...  So people stayed together for that feeling of love... They would live and raise children together and be remembered.  I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we be that way?
And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
What kind of jewel is this?
But there may be a few around somewhere.
What makes you think so?
Yes...
Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
Maid? Relative?
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to.
I don't know.
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.
Meet me at the Starlight Motel on Sycamore... I'll be there in twenty minutes.
He'll kill us.
Are you positive he knows?
What deal?
He works for Mr. Eddy.
It was a long time ago... I met someone at this place called Moke's... we became friends. He told me about a job...
In pornos?
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
We killed him.
Yeah.
You don't look so good.
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
Sheila?
A cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison.
No.
I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.
I want to see him.
We know that.
He's not Madison?
I won't ever tailgate.
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME. I WANT YOU TO GET A DRIVER'S MANUAL, AND I WANT YOU TO STUDY THAT MOTHERFUCKER... AND I WANT YOU TO OBEY THE GOD DAMN RULES. FIFTY FUCKIN' THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON THE ROAD LAST YEAR.  CAUSE OF FUCKIN' ASSHOLES LIKE YOU. TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA GET A MANUAL.
You're up early.
What was that?!!!
Where would you feel safe?
They're gonna cook him.
Okay.
Who is this?
Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
At your house. Don't you remember?
What's goin' on?
You want some company?
Why haven't you called me?
What's happening to you? What happened to your face?
What do you mean?... You've been acting strange lately... Like the other night.
I beg your pardon, brother. What did you say you were hunting?
I'm a paleontologist.
Well, what do you know about that!
Uh-huh.
It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? Say, we're supposed to be traveling east, aren't we?
Why, of course. Yes.
Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south—
Yes!
Don't mind Lovey. He's got the misery.
No kidding?
So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
What are we going to do?
That's what I say. What do you say to a rubber of bridge? I saw some cards in the other room.
Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
Cave, eh? Where?
Hey - look!
There you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving.
Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!
That's intelligent.
Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
But Mr. Chang, all these things - books, instruments, sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters?
Well, it must have taken–
Centuries.
Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?
Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange .
I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
Shall we have another?
Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?
Why, no.
Splendid!
Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
That Conway seemed to belong here. In fact, it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here.
But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.
I have waited for you, my son, for a long time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that I might find you . My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages without.
All right, go ahead!  We go on to the next plane. Bring out any people that are left.
Bob, these are all that are left.
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose of—
I said we're getting out of here. Back to civilization. I made a deal with the porters. They brought in a load of books or something, and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for us five miles outside the valley. Come on, get your things together. Where's your top coat?
What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?  How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?
George, are you sure of the porters? About their taking care of you, I mean?
Why not?
What do you mean - "fade away like an echo"?
You're wrong, George.
Target practice again! One of these days they're going to hit us.
Where were you hiding?
In for what?
At the mercy of a mad pilot.
Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
I'm thirty.
Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on.
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
All right, I'll be there.
And if I say yes?
... think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which I assure you I have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct--
You think we're nuts.
Sorta literally gets ahead of himself.
You do?
Grab the coffee, will ya?  I told Zed I'd give him a buzz.
'Hell, I may as well do something useful.
Dee, you've been useful for 50 years.  We're clueless, you're tired. Why don't you go home and get some rest.
Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
Well, how about if I guess, then? Black: Vast space.  Deep. Spiritual. The essence of infinity.
Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
Just so I understand... you're "thing" is... acting like an idiot?  Or is it actually being an idiot?  Besides--
I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.
Ernie Goose?  Cynthia?
We saw it in the office.  It went from this big...    to big...   in a day.
It's marble.
Would you call this a code 100?
Do IT!  SHOOT HIM!
I put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across.
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
What do we do?
What do we do?    Lean into it.
Yeah ... ?
And I'm arranging deportation papers.
Er. well, nowhere special.
Oh yeah?  Well if you're suddenly such a good samaritan, why didn't you file a departure report, like you're supposed to?  You know how many rules you've just broken?
Did he say where?
Well, it wasn't in the jar...
What?
Take it.
Can you see the balloon man?
Forget that guy --
Agatha...
The other two will die without me.
Agatha, you're never going back there.
Think, John.  Why would they set you up?
I can't even stand up --
I know you're in a hurry, so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes.
That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
Try again.
You're part of my flock now, John. Welcome.
So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
We won't let them.
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
You can't run --
Okay, Jad, what's coming?
Did he close the front door?
Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
I find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs.
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
Stop --
Who are you?
Sean, wait...
If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
Just what is it you think I can do for you?
What's so funny?
I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
It began as play.  A guessing game like you play with any toddler, except these children always guessed right.  And then the nightmares started. They were all different, but all the same.  They were all about murder.  And the murders were all happening.
And, yet, a chain of events has started.  A chain that will lead inexorably to his death.
Where?
I'll get EYEscanned a dozen times before I get within ten miles of Precrime.  They'll pick me up...
John said something about him being set up because he "found out about her."
Good God.  What was that?
Danny, tell me what you're thinking.
So there is a way to fool the system?
Uh-huh.  Okay.  You got some images I can work with?
Don't worry.  I'll bring him in unharmed.
No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
There a maid in this hotel?
I don't know, why?
The man across the street.  I've seen him before...
Howard --
I like it.
I don't have any sugar either.
That was our apartment.
It was nobody's fault.
They've never been separated before.
Look, Bobby, I don't know what happened, and I don't want to know what happened, but something's up.
What's 'incidentals?'
What, sir?
Come on. Just tell me. It'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms.
What if I gave you forty?
Thank you, sir.
Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
Should I fuck him?
Mommy works hard so you can have all your pretty clothes. Don't you like your pretty clothes?
It's a poison arrow tree frog.
A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
Yeah? You sure?
Maybe if you didn't go Rambo every time I did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. Meantime, I gotta feed my little girl.
What'd you say?
I said no touching.
Draw.
You driving her?
How bad is it?
It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing.
Yeah?
They ran shit back in the Eighties. Used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. That's back when the Irish was making a play against the Italians. I don't know if they still around, but I don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case.
Quick drop. In and out.
They were out of line --
I'll work it off.
Not driving Jess, you won't.
What?
You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.
I know.
What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity.
He'll work it off.
You want --
Take a few days --
Where's the drop?
Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
Nah.
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
Understand me?
Ricky's taken care of.
Yeah... Mmmm, that sounds good... Uhu...
We're with Ruiz.
Ruiz isn't here.
What are you saying?
So?
Don't be shitty.
So I'm like, 'Maybe I'm not on the list cause I'm not a fuckin Persian.'
We need guns.
Please. I got three inches on you. You wouldn't have landed a punch if I didn't let you.
You wanna go right now?
We'll kill Fairfax this year.
Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
What? Did she say something?
See, man. Maxie fuckin takes care of you when you're in. Beats cleaning carpets.
Yeah, I guess.
Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.
But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
I told you what they said.
This is bullshit, man.
Look, man, I never met Ruiz, okay? I don't know what the fuck I'm picking up, what the fuck I'm dropping off, who the fuck I'm meeting. All I know is Maxie's still pissed at me cause I sold his fucking van.
You gotta be kidding me. I vouched for you.
You know this guy?
Yeah. What vibe?
Where do you think you're going?
What the fuck was that about?
You gonna shank him in the shower?
I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
Wanna bet?
Eighty bucks?!?
Eighty five.
Think about it: You knocked out that Jewish kid's tooth, cost him eight grand, maybe more. Maybe lost his whole line of clientele? He knows you're fucking up Jess' dancing, and I got a feeling he knows I stole his carpet cleaning van by the way he looks at me. He can't kill us in LA cause that leads to too many questions. So he flies us out here first class for a 'drop' that's turned into whatever? He can make us disappear out here real nice...
Where do you get this shit?
C'mon...
How is it you're good? You on a list?
It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes.
Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
I'm half Irish.
Nah, see, Maxie just asked him to set that shit up as a favor. He, you know, he tied in with the club. Set us up so, you know, you feel at home.
Does anyone want another?
Nah, man...
Is it nice?
A lot of Persians?
Shut it, man. Shut it. Tom is a square. He don't but dabble in shit. Maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him, through an Austrian passbook account.
I'll get it.
What they call you?
Okay, baby. Now you outfitted. You ready to tackle the street?
It hit?
I don't want your money.
The dirty yellow rat bastard.
You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
The question is, who are you? You are in the darkness, but it's not your fault. Elijah Muhammad can bring you into the light.
Elijah who?
What do you do with your time?
That's what Mama used to say.
I'm telling you God's words, not no hustle. I'm talking the words of Elijah, the black man's God. I'm telling you, boy, that God is black.
What? Everybody knows God is White.
Did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con?
I can't make out that shit.
Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
I'm not Malcolm Little and I'm not Satan.
The body is a holy repository.
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
-- the hardest and the greatest.
"I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle."
You are now Benjamin 2X.
I see your point.
What?
Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
How do you like it?
Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.
You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.
I think so. Can you catch a plane?
I'll be away a lot.
Why are you looking at me like that?
A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?
I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
I'm tired of praying.
The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
You put it very well.
If you want to tell me.
Let me do it then.
Did you see the papers today?
Can I ask you something?
Sure, man.
Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.
Get out.
Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?
To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.
I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.
You're my father.
You like 'em scrambled soft or hard, sweetie?
The hell you are.
What did you do, Homey, palm it?
I'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one.
I'm Minister Malcolm X. Two witnesses saw him brought in. He was not brought out.
He told you that?
We were parceled out, all five of us. I went to this reform school and lived at this woman's house. She was in charge.
They talked about me like
You have a rather checkered past. Mr. Creasy. Your Interpol file is six pages long.
It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
You walk out and deal justice. You're what I wish I could be.  The policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want.
Maybe I can help your situation and you mine.
What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos?
[She's late, Mr. Creasy.]
[I don't know! We work in parts. A voice calls in a kidnapping. We deliver the target to the guardians. We don't even know them. They might transfer to other guardians. The negotiators and the bosses don't even see the target. They just make the deal!]
[How much do you want?]
[Listen! I will give you a life for a life.]
[Do you know who I am? I am the commandante of the Judicial anti- kidnapping division.]
[O.K. So tell me more.]
[That's all I know! Please. I'm sorry for the girl. But it was business! I'm a professional.]
Were you provided with a gun?
Yes.
You did something on impulse?
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
No.
I dropped her at home.
Dyslexic?
You got that right.
Mr. Creasy, I wanted to make sure you have everything you need.
I'm fine.
It makes it all seem so serious.
[Yes.]
A man's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes. Only the amount matters.
I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
I think it's nice he's American.
I think it's fantastic.
She likes him.
Pinta likes him too much.  She thinks of him as a father.
[Is that good or bad?]
[When you talked to him, did he look sane?]
[Who's that?]
I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing.
I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
That's what friends do.
And they took that away.
I told you she wasn't attractive...
Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...
Which one was that?
I could see she likes you.
There was one nice-looking one there inna black dress and beads, but she's dancing now.
There's a nice-looking little short one for you right now.
You want me to ride down with you?
I told this dog I was gonna call her today about two-thirty.
Angie. He says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.
You will see. A coupla months, you gonna be an old lady, sleeping onna couch in her daughter-in-law's house.
This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
Siddown, siddown. You want some chicken? We got some chicken in the ice box.
She was always a bit thin in the hips...
That means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.
Sure. Thanks a lot about my mother. We'll work out some arrangement, because naturally I want to pay...
Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason.
Oh, sure.  Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her siddown.
What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.
What didn't you like about her?
Hey, Ang'...
You want a beer, Ang'?
Waddaya mean, Ralph?
I'm with a girl, Ralph.
No, that's my other brother, Freddie. My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already. He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie.
Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?
She was here, you know, Wednesday, and I said, "Catherine, my sister..."
We didn't tell her anything yet. We thought that we'd leave it to you. We thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you. Because that way it looks like she's doing you a favor, insteada we're throwing her out, and it won't be so cruel on her. Do you want Tommy and me to stay here with you?
Well, I'll tell you, Aunt Theresa...
Tommy!
Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?
I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
You boys'll have to go to work early.
Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
Miss you, Walt.
This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our houseboy. I'm teaching him English.
Us. Lead us not into...
Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.
Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.
This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
Best equipped dentist in the whole goddam Army. Care to have a look, a man with your background?
Y'all just act natural.
Hail to the chief! We-all got a responsibility, men. He's crowned like a king ought to be, but he can't just walk to the Mess Hall by himself. He has to be carried by native bearers.
What's he got to write, for God's sake?
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
How come nobody knows about him? And you do?
Henry's got our orders! We're going home!
Any time. Whenever we want.
It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them.
If we had closer relations, there wouldn't be any misunderstandings. That's where a football game would help. Between your outfit and mine.
A football game?
Gimme three.
You betcher ass, Dad.
I'm going to play poker until three a.m. or until the patient is ready for surgery. However, if you'd like to operate on him yourself right now, be my guest. I get the same dough whether I work or not.
Now, General, I'm going to sandbag you. Do you think we're ready to get out of this belly?
Right.
Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert.
I think I've seen this nut somewhere.  Haven't I?
Lucky you didn't have your mouth open or it would have gone down your throat.
What are they peeking at? Captain Waldowski in the shower?
Black capsule.
Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
If we squeeze him through, I'm going to get him into Androscoggin College.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
It was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. I must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose. I can't feel it in the heart or the right pulmonary artery. So it's in the left pulmonary artery.
On the contrary, I've observed he's not only a good technical surgeon, he's a good military surgeon. And that includes how a man dresses and how he bears himself and his sense of what it means to be an officer in the United States Army.
That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
The bastards outconned us.
But I'm married.
Ayuh.
A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
He should come to now for a while, but he's got so much dope in him by tomorrow he won't know fact from fantasy.
Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
I'm sorry to hear that. You think he's unfit for military service?
You really say the cutest things.
Be the longest short-arm inspection you ever held!
Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
You don't go after the local scrunch?
What's the story?
He's coming to.
Glad to know you. Drop in at my clinic anytime you feel like playing a little poker, or even if a tooth is bothering you.
There's only one worth noticing.
What did you have to test, for God's sake... the dental Don Juan of Detroit?
But it's all over now, and I can't face it. Imagine if you found out you were one, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife. Well, I got the same problem multiplied.
In the direction you want to go.
Morning Painless. How they goin'?
I have not understood what you means.
Hi, Ho-Jon. How they goin'?
There ought to be a law against dentists reading. Matter of fact, I thought there was. Anyway, this is an obsession. He can't be persuaded out of it.
But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
I should fire him because he got in the way of Trapper's fist? No. I've put up with a lot from you guys, but now I finally have to take disciplinary action.
You mean who hit who?
Yes, that's what I mean.
O'Reilly, what is it?  There aren't more choppers coming?
Sir?
Oh, get out of here!
Morning, girls. Good morning Major.
Against anything. Just protest.
Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?
Now, look, John. Here's the speech. It's in caps and double-spaced. You won't have any trouble reading it. Not nervous, are you?
Hello, John.
John Doe Clubs? What for?
Look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?
But here's the funniest part of it all. I was the fella up there doing the marrying. You know, the Justice of the Peace or something . . .
Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.
Look, John—what we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek." It's just a—
. . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?
Oh, somebody else sitting there?
Oh! Oh, it's beautiful, D. B. Well—I don't quite know what to say . . .
All set, Ann?
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammers—start arguments.
Say that again.
What John Doe?
A deal?
Very pretty. Very pretty, indeed, Miss Mitchell. But would you mind telling me who goes on Christmas Eve?
Who, for instance?
Okay, sister, you get your job back.
Oh, swell! Is that the contract? 
Yes.  What's he doing here?
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
I ain't seen him for a week.
No. Her mother's awful worried about her. When she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, the girl, I mean!
Yeah, Boss?
Hey, Doc, look. Look, Doc. Gimme that again, will yuh? Who's gonna get him?
Well, sir, about a dozen families got together and gave Grubbel a job watering their lawns. Isn't that wonderful? And then we found jobs for six other people and they've all gone off relief!
You must be wrong, Mr. Connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the John Doe Clubs.
Don't write 'em? Why, that gold- grabbin' dame would double-cross her own mother for a handful of Chinese yen!
Did you write that letter to Miss Mitchell?
What are you doing up here then?
Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!
She isn't?
No, she just left. I'm surprised you didn't run into her. She went over to Mr. Norton's house.
Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
Racket? What do you mean?
What?
He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
You're my hero.
Mind if we make a stop on the way? We busted Frank Antonucci on possession. He gave us a lead on that Polk Street jewelry heist.
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
What happened? Is there a problem?
Perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this... situation.
You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you.
Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
Don't make do it, Mike.
They have less power over you if you look into my eyes.
Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
Hi, Roper.
How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
Are you in charge, Roper?
I've rarely shot anyone.
National Marksman Competition.
It was okay.
You're a real excitable sort, aren't you?
I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for "fast advancement".
Come on. Let's go for a drink.
She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married.
No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
Tell me what you need.
If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie.
You know the ten commandments?
You tell me.
Ronnie... Yeah, so.
The 6 horse is still last.
We won.
He's cutting down the visibility.
You're crazy.
Is the hostage injured?
You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why?
I worship you.
You think I didn't need you?
That kind with the garlic and the oil that I like so much?
Yeah that's it.
Scottie, Scottie...
Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality.
Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
You let us worry about that.
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
What do you think would be in order?
Roper...
32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. A unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside.
Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
God-Damn you!
She said I have a son...
Corporate fingerprints all over it.
-- You told me.
Yes.
But you were with me.
Just like that?
Don't know what you're talking about.
Program name?
Transmit copy of program via satellite north uplink.
Connect to public access.
Rangers...  I'm afraid you're too late.
He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.
... What's happening to him?'
To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
By bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites, I can send a long-range pulsar signal to within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates.
PTERODACTYL!
It's... an eagle?
Sure. What's with the brick wall?
Tell me something, Meyer. How can you get up at dawn to walk on the beach if you're on your honeymoon?
Boo-Boo.
Up here, Boss.
That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
Maybe you better hear what I got to say first.
So what happened?
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
I guess I am. Just a little.
I ain't mad. I ain't even surprised. But I can't let ya fuck me. On the other hand, if ya got needs beyond the thirty-five, I'll advance it to you against our next deal on the same terms.
You got men on Profaci's place?
You ain't even a man yet.
I think Maranzano's talkin' a hell of a deal.
You could have stopped him.
Come on, Charlie. We gotta have a top guy. Otherwise these wars ain't never gonna stop.
How soon can we pull this off?
After all this time I'd think you'd know me better, Meyer.
Meyer, ain't anybody ever told you ya look more like a bookkeeper than a fuckin' mobster?
We're gonna change it, Bugs. Once we get rid of the Dons, the Commission's gonna rule. No more wars. No more vendettas. No more Boss of All the Bosses.
You're a smart boy, Charlie, but there's somethin' you ain't learned yet. A man needs a family.
This business is about taking risks.
Tommy tells me that Capone's coming in from Chicago.
He's trying to make it.
What are ya thinkin'?
Ya did good. I ain't seen the Boss so happy in weeks.
The kid just called me stupid.
Then perhaps you need to know me.
I got partners.
Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us.
At first, it will hurt you. But you will come to understand and we will be strong together.
Why didn't you tell me that Maranzano had made you an offer?
Know somethin'? This stuff's just kick-the-can on ponies.
Wanna know what I think?
That a Jew compliment?
Awww... deep down I'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.
What's the maximum safe dose?
Olive or eyeball?
Aw, buck up. Have another 'tini.
<u>Why</u>??
That's not going to stop his nightmare -
The Nightmare Juice! It's gone! Somebody switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid!!
Besides, Julie wouldn't...she'd never...
Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
Got a doctor on duty.
Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
Who?
How was it? I don't recall.
I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring.
Nothing for him! He's being repressed.
Hypnos?
My Fellow Americans. I have a dream. Let us boldly go where no man has gone before.
I'm reportin' this to my union!!
Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resumé. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT?
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you.
Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.
Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.
I just need to use the phone, lady.
The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
He seemed quite taken with you.
I don't want to talk about it.
You know, you never tell me anything.
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
It's unusually quiet tonight, isn't it?
Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
I love you, Mom.  I have to run.  You remembered to call the limousine service, right?
Really?
I wonder what they do in there?  Don't they frighten you?  They all look so ...
Forty-five all total.
Forty-five?  I thought it was only supposed to be thirty?
Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it.
I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
You are saying, in effect, that this is a forgery?
Positively not in the station! Gone!
How do you *like* this! You don't suppose that ranger met up with some kids--and took 'em for a hike!
That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up.
That old standing offer from Diz Moore--Poet of Washington Correspondents.
Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!
You play--left field.
Well, well--  Yeah--I got smart and thought I'd slip one over on the old man in the press meeting. I said, "Mr. President, about the monopoly investigation--" And he jumps right in and says, "Diz, if you were sitting in my chair, would you answer the question you're about to ask?" He had me.
Waiter!
Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?
No. How'd you feel? Quick.
Diz--
You--you've been a good egg, Diz. Maybe we could clear out of this town--get to feel like *people*--get the habit of lifting up our eyes-- live like we just got out of a tunnel.
You've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz?
We're gonna get married.
Yeah--that's right. Diz--
Okay--I mean--
Hey! We're gettin' married--!
You know, we're getting married.
Can't that wait, Hubert?
This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
Thanks, Governor--*yes*! Do you mind? His head--Ma'll take the tail.
"Boy Stuff." That's the name of Jeff's magazine. He prints it.  Look--here's one--oh, it's great-- *everybody* reads it--all the kids in the State--a million of 'em. Look, Pop--let me read you a--
Jeff for Senator.
Here they are--I got them. They are all right.
He's a newspaper publisher I know-- and--
For a question!
Yeah, Dad always used to say the only causes worth fighting for were lost causes.
I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
I'm sorry! Gee! I hope--
Yes, sir, I yield for a question.
Just fine.
What is it?
Office of--Senator Smith?
You *couldn't*?
I know--but you--you're going to help.
Oh, just a day--
Committee, huh?
That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.
Yes, I see that.
Calendar?
Pardon?
Well, anyway, it's *something* like that--  And it *is* important. That--that Steering Committee has *got* to see it that way. And I'm sure Senator Paine will do all he can--  He's a fine man, Miss Saunders, isn't he? He knew my father, you know.
All right. Sure. Just curious. The picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle-- or something--
Yay!
Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--
Just for the fun of it.--You see the one that makes it back home in the fastest time, I am going to enter in the nationals.
How--how do you do, Miss Paine?  I--I apologize for looking like this-- I--I have to be going now--
That's--that's splendid.
Well--I--
"So help me God."
Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone though--wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by Madame Lafayette--
Yeah! How about it? You're a nature lover. Do you handle any of that sign language?
How'd you like a punch in the nose?
Whaddaya mean! What did *I* have to do with it? I don't blame the guy.  Wow! Twenty-four hours in this town and nothing but dog-fights! And things aren't bad enough--last night I have to get a run-around from some wise dame--
Be quiet, Chick--I'm trying to think--  This Deficiency Bill is going to be read in the Senate tomorrow.
The ranger's notices? No idea at all.
By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?
That's right.
You're the best nurse I can think of--
Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now--  I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--
Why don't you do it yourself?
Do you?
We can't drop it now, Joe. We bought the land around this Dam and we're holding it in dummy names. If we drop it or delay it--we are going to bring about investigations, and investigations will show that we own that land and are trying to sell it to the State under phoney names. No, Joe, in my judgment the only thing to do is push this Dam through--and get it over with.
Oh, Jim, that's beside the point. This boy's different. He's honest and beside he thinks the world of me. We can't do this to him.
Jim, you don't have to--
Oh, it's all right--it's all right. It seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years, especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe, I've put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends, but I guess we'll survive. We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense, that's all. In the meantime, you explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam. It's your bill-- it's your reputation, and if he can't find enough facts to break you with, you just send him to me and I'll give him a couple of good ones. I'm taking the next plane home.
You can't say *that* to--
It's crucifying him--!
I hit him from the floor with everything I knew!
How nice.
Do I actually *see* this--?
Mr. President...
Pixilated.
Never can tell what he's going to do.
Why, you own it, Longfellow.
Thank you very much.
Were you given an assignment to follow the activities of Longfellow Deeds?
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
What's that got to do with it?
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
To most people, it's an awful letdown.
You're worried about those articles they're writing about you, aren't you?
Oh, that—
You started out to be a successful newspaper woman, didn't you?
I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
Just a minute. No, you don't.
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
Sorry, Babe. Sorry. It would have made a swell story. I just got carried away. That's too bad. So he proposed to you, huh?  What a twist! You set out to nail him - and he—
I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
Boy, was he burning.
Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
Yes, sir.
Is that the best you've got?
The Falkner sisters are rather timid, Your Honor, and wish to be together. If the court pleases, I will only have one of them testify.
Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney—
All set.
Yeah?
Yes.
Why, no.
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
"There once was a man named Cobb, Who kept Semple away from the mob. Came the turn of the tide And Semple - he died - And now poor Cobb's out of a job!"
I can't hold out on you any longer. Lamb bites wolf.  Beautiful.
Did you see all this stuff in the papers?
I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
What about your knocking off for lunch?
Not hungry. I want to get through this work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on those trucks?
Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings.
That's impossible. The opera has never paid.
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
You remember, Dr. Fosdick, in my last book there are some very fine examples.
Yeah - that's all that's worrying you. What do I want?  A chance to feed a wife and kids! I'm a farmer. A job! That's what I want!
Mrs. Semple?
Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.
I'm glad to see you're willing to be reasonable, Mr. Deeds.
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
I say we don't want to appear greedy.
Yes?
No.  Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.
No, he's too fussy for that. That's what's the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be married—
He's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
What do you think you're doing?
That's what the two policemen said, sir.
Pack my things, Walter. I'm going home.
I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened.
You must have been concerned.
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
Better make yourself comfortable. We got a three hour drive here.
Well... you see, when I broke it off with Phyllis, she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain -- how to put it -- doubts she's been harboring...
What's that?
Why? I'm paying for this.
Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.
You remember when I asked you about pornography --
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so...
I think it's like... inquisitive.
What do you want to know?
You like me. How come?
Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful?  You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
Okay.
What it might take is... doing time.
Hello, Lionel.
I been drivin' since I was twelve.
Martin.
Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway.
Oh... not a real doctor.
Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
Feel free to lie down. Most people do.
No.
Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch?  Just kidding.
I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.
Sore throat?
I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
It might've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor-patient relationship.
Is something wrong, Sofie?
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
Um-huh.
I think so.
I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well.
Hello.
Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
What do you mean, "in no time"?
The school board doesn't pay you? What kind of deal is that?
Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
I don't think you know what you're talking about.
What'd he say?
I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
Would you like another beer?
I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
Skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with.
Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything?
Really?
Just you.
Sounds like you have several.
But you studied psychology, right? You did the training and just never got the degree?
I trained in the east, myself -- Cornell -- and I don't care what anyone says, there really are regional differences. I found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing... Did you?
Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
You know where he's taking her?
Oh yes, of course.
How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways?
C'mon, friend.
It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
You put up with me, because I can read and write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library.
-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
I wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon!
I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
So who's the broad?
A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.
You two!
You don't believe in curses, huh?
I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
Something like that.
According to that Book, once this creature has been reborn, his curse will spread, and as he grows in strength, so will his curse grow, infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed.
He's here! I saw him! That thing is here!
Oh yes I do! I have something right here!
You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!
I found it, Evy! I found it
I can't believe the price of these fleabags.
None taken.
Where's my gun?
Really?
I thought you were done?
Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a guy thing.
Who are you?
He was cute though.
But you're a superhero.
No one will believe us.
What did he mean?
Snap out of it!
I hope you enjoy these cigars. I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get them.
Ummm.
Superheroes.
I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy. In two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it. It's the perfect time to switch teams... So what do you say?
You're nuts.
Against.
You're a spy.
What?
Monica... I was wondering if -- uh -- maybe we -- I mean you and I -- could -- uh -- you know -- get a -- I mean have a...
Yeah.
Roy.
What have they got that we ain't got?
It's me.
Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --
But now Casanova's back! And we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!
My heart died a long time ago.
It is not dead. It is hiding.
Have you ever seen him?
This place is built like a fortress.
There's a vague similarity.
So you're chicken?
I'm soaked.  Oh great.
Agents?
Roy, remember, it is all within your power. The only thing that's in your way... is you.
He's turned into a completely normal person!
Not yet.
We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... 
So what can I get you?
I always knew that you were special.
Don't crunch the leaves.
I hope you will forgive me, Your Majesty, for requesting an audience at such a late hour, but I have traveled all the way from Moscow to see you, on a matter which cannot wait.
For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.
Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground.
Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?
Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
There are none here.
The numbers are not particularly relevant.  You are not up against soldiers -- this is a mob, and they will run as soon as things become sufficiently unpleasant.
Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?
I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
To Joseph Bonaparte -- Dear Joseph, I have been informed by my wife of the cold and spiteful treatment she has been receiving at the hands of my family, since my departure.  I am also informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money I left with you expressly for this purpose.  Must you, too, take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the Bonaparte family?
Excuse me, General Bonaparte, but I believe this is an extremely urgent matter, requiring your immediate attention.
Oh -- where do you come from?
I haven't been there for three years.
That's a nice city.  This is your first time here, isn't it?
Just a minute, General.  Listen, don't let them fool you with all their grand la-de-da.  They've all made their money from the war -- mostly from crooked war contracts. They say Citizen Barras has put away millions.
Ah, Didier -- you are alive.
His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
My God...!  What time is it?
How did it spread so quickly?
We have already captured a dozen incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago.  They said they were acting under orders of the secret police.
But this is not a matter which can be settled tonight, surely?
I have met her.  What is your business with me?
The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?
Yes, I am, sir.
Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me.
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
Not even the slightest hint of something?
Oh... I see.  I understand.  How is... the Emperor?
You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps?
No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.
But you have had mistresses while you were away.
Open the door.  It's me.
Don't be ridiculous and go away -- I'm busy working.
Where is Madame Trillaud?
Will you be joining us, soon?
Separate bedrooms?
I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.
Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.
I know that I shouldn't butt into things... that are really no concern of mine... but you shouldn't write a letter like that to Joseph.
You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?
Yes, I wrote it.
What was there to tell?
And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
Article 46, calls for the virtual dismemberment of Prussia, reducing her population by half and her army to a token force.
I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot.  Do you know him, monsieur?
You may save your philosophy for the magistrate, Monsieur Varlac.  I am only a simple officer in the army, and to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called murder by honest men.
Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica on August 15th, 1769.  He had not been a healthy baby and his mother, Letizia, lavished him with care and devotion.  In middle age, he would write about her from St. Helena.
His moods at this time were complex and varied.
On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France.  He would later say:  "I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."
Okay, I know what I want this time.
Stretch it out.
What's the green stuff poking out?
I ain't trying to rob you...
Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million.  We bought this house and I spent the rest on this.  It's the bomb, huh?
Man, this a cool house.
You straight?
I can't taste nothing.
Damn, you got a stalker.
You know what this is?
It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow.
Thanks a lot, Craig.
You better open up a window or something before the smell gets out.
Alright, Roach, see you around.
Naw.  I bet'cha it's something better than air.
You go first.
I hope to God that dog is happy.
What you see?
Wait here?  So Cheeco can bite my ass off?  Tell me where it is I'll do it.
It's locked.
Delivery!
Delivery!
I said hold on!
Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?
Look, Roach, I know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited.  But if Pinky catches you doing that X-Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired.  You feel me?
Roach, what are you doing?
'Scuse me, partner, but that's a ghetto knock.
Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach?
Hey, guys, I'm outta here.
Tape his mouth shut.
Ezal!  Ezal!
Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
My back.
Well, we better hit the road, too. Craig, get your stuff.
Elroy.
Huh?
Mr. Nasty time.  But take it easy on me, girl.
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
Don't remind me.
Amtrack?
'S okay. What do you think?
You were saying?  Your daughter....?
It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.
Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl!
Yes, yes, I understand.
This is for you. In it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. It is her itinerary. She is presently - are you listening, Mr. Watson?
Are you 'fucking with me!?
What would you do in my place?
I kill her - and you kill me.
No.
Is that something precious?
All right, let's just...let's get security in on this.
It's about time I did. I was one of those guys, workaholics. I worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter.  That's just what I thought I was supposed to do.
I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
Irene is going to help.
You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
Fuckin' A.
Close your eyes.
What gives?
No.
With that ten thousand dollars I could build a Tabernacle that'd make the Wheeling Island Tabernacle look like a chicken-house!
That Sword has served me through many an evil time, Ben Harper.
I'll bet.
When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
Do you mind me cussin', boy?
And the Lord told that man --
Yes! Yes! Hallelujah!
See ye got two more peeps to your brood.
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
Plan on a longer visit next time.
Say what, Walt Spoon!
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
What's wrong, Mother?
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
My, that fudge smells yummy!
How?
Hing, hang, hung.
Now can I tell?
It's all here.
Up river.
Tell me what, boy?
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
All right...  Come along.
You don't reckon I'd leave you.
Yes?
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
Naturally.
What's their names?
Didn't you have no inkling?
How's that?
That's mighty brave of you, Reverend.
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
Get up, Willa.
Heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!
Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.
This man down at the Drugstore...
He never asked me for nothin'.
How long's this been going on?
Okay, good. She's asleep.
What happened? That needle sank like a rock.
No.
You believe in the Boogey Man?
If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.
Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
Get outside and watch her house. If you see anything funny call me.
I won't.
Your old man thinks I did it, don't he?
Nice to have a fire.
I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
When I passed through the laundry yard today I saw all the women huddled around this so I brought it up here. Things like this create a bad feeling. First they didn't know whose it was. Then they saw the Paris label and did it start a commotion! Some said it's what we all ought to wear and others said it's like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline. It undermines our whole cause.
I see.
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
What do you wear in the morning?
You wouldn't like Razinin.
Can you blame them?... at least the May Day parade is over.
It is, Ninotchka! It is! He must have been in Paris! You can see it in his whole attitude! He just picked up a crumb of our black bread, shook his head, and dropped it.
We are not comrades any more... we are friends, Ninotchka.
Yes! We could stay with Leon!
Monsieur.
This is the apartment we have reserved for you, Comrade Yakushova. I hope you like it.
Yes, Comrade?
Guest?
Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is your mother country. Three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother.
Count d'Algout is still asleep.
Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds and make yourself agreeable to the Whites if you don't keep up your strength.
Good evening, Gaston.
Your breakfast, monsieur.
What time have you, Gaston?
Eight forty-two, sir.
Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.
Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
Good evening, Your Highness.
That won't help you! You can't intimidate us!
Don't call it desertion. Our little restaurant... that is our Russia... the Russia of borscht, the Russia of beef Stroganoff, blinis with sour cream...
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?
What did she say about me?
How much does this cost?
Two thousand francs.
Only myself and two other girls. One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor.
That's even better.
We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer!
Well, boys, I'd like to help you but what can I do? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby!
She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!
We dealt directly with the representative of the Grand Duchess. I am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture.
If there is anything we can do for you...
That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.
Not always... look at me... I've been back twice. 
Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
Don't hold that against me... please!
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
Confess what?
Gladly.
I don't have to but I find it natural.
You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you.
I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
Not too big and not too small. What I'd call the typical room of an average man. Or shall we say a little above average. Now if there are any special aspects you wish to study I have nothing to conceal. Just look around. That's my desk. Those are my books, and here am I. Where shall we begin?
Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
Glorious, analytical...
On which boat?
Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
Do you like Scotch stories?
I don't look too foolish?
It's nine o'clock.
Leon, you know the jokes you told me a few days ago? I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them. Now, Leon that's wrong. I know they're not funny, they're silly. They're stupid. And still... I laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they are scoundrels and I should hate them -- then I realize who made them like that, and instead of sending my report to Moscow I tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat... and if this keeps on... am I too talkative?
Comrades! Good people of France!
No! No!
There it is... Thursday... you can't rip it out of the week....
Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry?  Let us be happy... give us our moment....  We are happy, aren't we, Leon?
Trying to keep me away from you! It couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but I found a way, didn't I? Darling, I had to see you. I wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.
Hello, Leon!
We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
Sweetheart, we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past!
First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
I've got one chapter Guizot thinks is terrific. "Caviar and Blood." Swana escapes over the ice!
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Oh, yes.
It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!
Now... here we have two very handsome soft-boiled eggs. Do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs? Probably not. They have such unfeeling eyes. We'll put in a great nugget of butter, plenty of pepper and salt... Darling, I haven't seen you for three livelong days... seventy-two hours!
That bad?  Old or young?
There's a charming crowd here tonight, isn't there?
I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.
I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.
Hello, Leon darling!
That does it, Swana.  Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.
That's all right... I grow on people.
My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative.
Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...
That's no business... that's a social injustice.
Good morning, Comrade.
Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
May I ask why?
Cigarette?
Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?
No.
This will do. 
I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be?
Where is that?
It's just a place for workmen.
So, what about those Watergate clowns, John?  This fuck Sirica's crazy. Thirty-five-year sentences!  There were no weapons.  Right?  No injuries. There was no success!  It's just ridiculous.
I agree it's ridiculous but --
No, we have nothing to hide.
I'm not going to be the scapegoat for this.  Haldeman and Ehrlichman are in just as deep as me.
I was sorry to hear about your wife.
I'll bet he would.
To protect his people.
I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.
It's a code or something.
I think he means the Kennedy assassination.
Eight words back in '72 -- "I covered up.  I was wrong.  I'm sorry" -- and the American public would've forgiven him.  But we never opened our mouths, John.  We failed him.
Martha's an idiot, she'll do anything to get John's attention.  If Mitchell'd been minding the store instead of that nut Martha we wouldn't have that kid Magruder runnin' some third-rate burglary!  Was he smoking pot?
Mitchell?
Hunt?  Howard Hunt?
It's more than that.  It could be more than that.  I want Hunt paid.
No, sir.
No, you didn't, Bob.
I end the longest war in American history and they keep harping on this chickenshit!  You know who's behind this, don't you -- it's Teddy Kennedy! He drowns a broad in his car and he can't run for president.
Exactly!  We've got to take the war to them.  Hit 'em where it hurts -- right in the nuts.  More assassinations, more killings.  Right, Al?
It's the President's personal property!  I will never give up my tapes to a bunch of Kennedy-loving Harvard Democrat cocksuckers!
Who the fuck does Cox think he is?  I never made a dime from public office!  I'm honest.  My dad died broke.  You know the sonofabitch went to law school with Jack Kennedy? ... The last gasp of the Establishment! They got the hell kicked out of 'em in the election, so now they gotta squeal about Watergate 'cause we were the first real threat to them in years. And by God, Al, we would have changed it, changed it so they couldn't have changed it back in a hundred years, if only ...
I know it well, sir.
Fucking hell.
But, sir, you're covered -- no one here gave orders to break into the damned Watergate.  We're clean.  It's only the Ellsberg thing, and if that comes out, it's "national security."
Uh, no one, of course, is going to see these tapes, but ...
Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.
Christ, you're right -- Gray makes Jerry Ford look like Mozart.  Just have Helms call him.  Helms can scare anybody.
Before?!  Eisenhower approved that?
Jesus!
So?  You wanted Castro dead. Everybody wanted Castro dead.  If Hunt and the others are CIA, why don't we just throw this back in the CIA's lap? Let Richard Helms take the fall?
Alright.  But why, if Kennedy is so clean in all this, didn't he cancel Track 2?
... and we've got the economic guys at five.  The Dow lost another 16 points. They're going to want a decision on the budget.  Sir?  ... Are we holding the line on a balanced budget?
We really must go, Mr. President.
So that explains his press notices. Working both sides of the fence: Jewboy Henry, always trying to get his Nobel Prize, get laid ...
Right.  They don't trust!  They don't trust America!
... beating out the other papers, chasing girls ...
Please!  I'll never let you down again, Mother.  Never.  I promise.
It's a gift, Richard.  This law school is a gift from your brother.
Hey ... you'll be able to do it now.
Relax, Dick, it's just me ... The desert's so beautiful, isn't it?  I want to go home, Dick.  Time to go home.
And me? ...
Firing you, Mr. Helms, wouldn't do any good.  Of course you'll continue as DCI.  You're doing a magnificent job.
Yes.
Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job.
My father built the house where I was born with his own hands.  Oh, it wasn't a big house ...
How about you?  Are you going to win?
Or he'll steal it like his brother. He's a mean little sonofabitch, Edgar ... He had the IRS audit my mother when she was dying in a nursing home.
Yeah, well, as I said, Edgar ...
That was a mistake.  The White House was full of Kennedy people then.  It still is.
Who do you think is behind it?
Jesus, I'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office.  He comes in here ranting and raving, dumping his crap all over the place ... Could you prove it, Edgar?
I always get my man.
Who we working for?
Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
Howard ... What the hell?  What're you doing?
Let's get the fuck out of here, shall we, ladies?
I know for a fact that the one with the big tits is a Republican, and she'd do anything for the Party.
Finally someone who's noticed!  I'm a great admirer of yours, too, Mr. Nixon.  You are an unusual politician. We share a mutual idol -- "Six Crises" sounds like a page from Churchill.
I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry.  What do you think?
... because people have got to know whether or not their President is a crook.  Well, I am not a crook.  I have never made a dime from public service ...
It was illegal, what he did.
And Dick beat the shit out of them.
How many?
They were throwing rocks, John, just rocks.  They don't think I feel ... but I feel too much sometimes.  I just can't let a whole policy get dominated by our sentimentality.
It broke my heart when Harold died.
I wanna fight just as dirty as he does.
... Use his women.
Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
No, we don't!  You're full of shit! You say you want to end the war, so why don't you?  My brother died over there last November.  Why?  What good was his death?
No, no.  I'm not powerless.  Because ... because I understand the system. I believe I can control it.  Maybe not control it totally.  But ... tame it enough to make it do some good.
Shit, plenty of people did their best writing in prison.  Gandhi, Lenin ...
What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
Don't you want to listen to Brown's victory speech?
My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?
Yeah ... I'm out.
I've missed you.
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.
Yes!
When?
I'm the only left, Dick.  If you don't talk to me, you ...
Why didn't you?
Hi, Happy.  Well, you're obviously making him happy.
Repartee, Dick -- very good.  Hey, I feel ten years younger!  It makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life?
Whatcha mean by that?
No ID in her room?
No money in his room there?
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
It's all the goddamned money, Ed Tom. The money and the drugs.  It's just goddamned beyond everything. What is it mean? What is it leading to?
...I don't know what I do feel like.
Oh yes.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
You ain't heard from him?
Nothin'?
These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
Yes ma'am?
You wouldn't think a car would burn like that.
It could be.
That's the boy.
That's possible.
No. Probably I don't.
...I believe they've done lit a shuck.
I don't know. Any new bodies accumulated out there?
There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when.
Okay.
Natural to the line of work they was in.
We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.
It is a car afire. But Wendell said there was something back country too.
Okay.
I can't plan your day.
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.
Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing.
You know what's goin' on?
I know something better.
I do know to a certainty. And you know what's going to happen now. You should admit your situation. There would be more dignity in it.
All right.
You know how this is going to turn out, don't you?
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
Is somethin' wrong?
I could come back then.
Well... I need to close now --
For what?
I didn't put nothin' up.
You stand to win everything. Call it.
Uh-huh. Double ought.
One room, one night.
I'm waitin' to hear your description of that.
Good. I need everything else.
It's all right.
Why don't I set you down here and we won't argue about it.
Okay.
...I'm wondering...
...Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you.
I know what it is. He won't find me again.
I'm retired.
Maybe he should be worried. About me.
You do, I reckon.
Yes sir.
No sir. I'm a veteran.
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
Yeah, it was great. Really put the whole idea of "church bake sales" in perspective...
...plenty
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
...and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe...
I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
What about it?
Any idea where it is?
Little place called "Williams," why?
That's a lie! I figured it out! I've been trying to tell this dumbass --
You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
Need something else?
I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?
I better go check on them.
Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up.
Umm... yes. Back home.
Did you watch it yet?
Are you and Larry happy?
Sue Ann, I thought you of all people would back me up on this, you know what Del's like. How did he take my note?
You never gave us a chance...
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
Lyla's very nice.
I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second?
Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
...well, then you ain't got much.
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!
I begged him to let me put that on!
If that little weasel ever walked in here I wouldn't serve him.
Did you love it?
Like Rome?
You made out alright.
Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie --
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
It's something I had to do. For David.
The one you were telling me about?
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
He has a wife?!
God, that's awful!
Her 'head'?! You're making this up...
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
Doctor David Ravell.
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
What are those for?
Looking for someone?
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...
Rosa...
That won't be necessary. She's staying with a Rosa something... Hernandez, Herrera. I know it's an 'H' sound... in Silverlake.
The fuck you talking about?
Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
Really. And where was that, old man?
I like this. I like doing business in the home. It's cozy...  Who's birthday?
You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
Oh, Jesus, please... Please, God.
That's right.
Are you out of your mind? You scalped him!
I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that?
Maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of this situation. It's bad enough that we don't have what we came here for. It's worse that we don't know where it is. And now this.  This was supposed to be my last job. I already put the deposit down on my boat.  How can you eat at a time like this? I get nauseous just watching you...
So she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day.
...among others.
I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
So what the fuck's a Finn?
Wise beyond her years, I'm sure, and such poise, too.  Very, very impressive...
Half.
We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
No.
Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
No, you believed her, we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?
'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...
Man, you have got to get some therapy.
Can I have an evil twin?
I'll think about it.
Nothin' complex about it. Del's dead, Betty's gone. She's probably dead, too.
You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
Did Chloe crack?
- and share one of your graves.
I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.
Gopher, Everett?
That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
Baptism. You two are just dumber'n a bag of hammers. Well, I guess you're my cross to bear-
Damn! We gotta skedaddle!
I left my pomade in that car! Maybe I can creep up!
Uh, we uh-
Pete have a brother?
Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective!  You ever been with a woman?
In any state.
Well, it's a well-run campaign, midget'n broom'n whatnot.
Reason why he's pullin' ah pants down.
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
Helluva idea.
No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.
Now Penny, stop that!
It's just a symbol, honey -
That's not my ring.
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
Well, we need that ring.
I don't care if it's ninety thousand.
Wait a minute! Who elected you leader a this outfit?
Pete's cousin turned us in for the bounty!
To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop. From his loving Cora. Ay-More Fie- dellis.
So I borrowed it till I did know!
The hell it ain't square one! Ain't no one gonna pick up three filthy unshaved hitchhikers, and one of 'em a know-it-all that can't keep his trap shut!
But...
Well, I don't record Negro songs. I'm lookin' for some ol'-timey material.  Why, people just can't get enough of it since we started broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' by, but-
They cut a record in here, few days ago, old-timey harmony thing with a guitar Accump-accump-uh-
But Pappy, they's inter-grated.
Mama said you was hit by a train!
To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night.  Survival of the fittest.
When did this happen?
I'm doing okay, sir.
What is it, the kicks? Is that it?
Yes, sir!
It's important, sir!
I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.
Only two things come out of Oklahoma, steers and queers. Which one are you, boy? I don't see any horns so you must be a queer.
Now when I say "understand" I want the whole group to say, "Yes, sir!" Understand?
Don't you dare ask me that question. I'm an adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like that!
Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can.
He was. He died.
Sid Worley, I think you're ashamed of me.
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
Hi, babe. Come on. I've got a couple of things I want to tell you.
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
Everything was different.
You hope.
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
God help you, Lynette!
You little bitch! How could you? Was there ever a baby, Lynette? That's all I want to know! Did you make up that baby, Lynette? Did you??
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.
Be a friend. Leave.
You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly.
That's no excuse for not going after what you want.
Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.
Call me during the week if you get the chance.
I'd like to come with you.
I'll never get it polished in time. Give me a buckle, Zack.
Jets.
No problem, but who's Susan?
No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" Zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and I couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived.
What?  What do you want me to do?
You're wasting your fucking time, man, you're wasting my time.  You don't know how to do this, and the longer we stay in here, the more likely she's gonna lose it and call the cops!
The walls are steel, right?
Fuck.
This was your department, Junior.
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
Shut up.
I'm afraid to let you think, Junior. Things get worse when you think.  Oh, that's gonna help.
I mean it!
Yeah?
'Bout four o'clock.
May I ask what the rest of that sentence was going to be?
Stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.  We can still handle this.  Can we still handle this?
He puts his hands on me again I'll bury a slug in his ear.
Something's weird.
Open the door.
Too many stairs.
I heard you.
Shaky?
Nope.
"What we want is in that room."
We're not coming out.  We're not letting you in.  Get out of my house. 
"Get the fuck out of my house."
Why did the chicken cross the road?
What, what, what is it?!
Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.
We're never getting out of here.
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
He'll do something.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Those ain't cops.
No...
Okay now, er, Huey, so what's your telephone number?
That's just it Huey. The pigs don't know how many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. We're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.
Sit down, This concerns you too.  I don't need to say that your department's handling of the Black Panthers -- particularly Inspector Brimmer's "undercover operation" has been a complete travesty.
Inspector Brimmer
Hey... what the hell you doing?
Hey... Cy... what now you a righteous Panther man, you too uppity to drink with us?
Well don't go forgetting your friends.
Motherfucker... you stay away...
Hey, this what they got you doing now?
Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
Yes sir, I did.
Not good enough Rodgers. Not good enough at all. Black terrorists on the floor of a State Capitol. I will not say this again, these Negro Commies are to be stopped and now. You tear them down. Either from the outside or the inside.
Huey man I got to talk with you...
Alone...
A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
Whatever you need, I'll be there.
Me? You've got a whole lot of other folks signing up. Why me?
Yeah, I do.
Just a kid.
If you got something to say, say it.
Sorry man...
You better just kill me Tyrone. And when Huey gets out, when Oakland's just wall to wall junkies, you tell him you blew away the only chance we all got. I'm sure he'll be real happy about that.
It's okay Mom. I'm allright.
I know who you are, Gabriel Marion. The last time I saw you, I was nine and you put ink in my tea.
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
If I'd known you were going to look like this, I never would have put ink in your tea.
Trust you and Harry Lee.  Remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis?
Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
Do you?
Goodbye, Charlotte.
Two pounds, fourteen ounces.
What unit?
My boys... my boys... you seem to have been well fed.  Thank you for that, Colonel.
First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me.
Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
Prisoner exchange.
It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley.
And if I triumph, you triumph.
The middle colonies?
Do you intend to enlist without my permission?
Oh?
I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.
Stay the course... your mother used to say that to me when I'd get drunk or lose my temper.
Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her.
I see, do as I say, not as I do.
Please.
Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up.
I am, I think.
You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?
How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?
Don't touch him.
And congratulations on the birth of your son.
How many came back?
He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?
Francis, tell me about General Cornwallis.
Remember Braddock?
Father?
What if you can't read what's written on there anymore?
Paxcow says it's almost too late!
Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?
That's what I think. I heard Missy Dandridge tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn't cross the road so much.
Because you promised.
But don't you dare say that.
I'm not tired!
Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
Nice.
You folks ready to go on?
For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?
Yes, but--
I tried to tell myself I buried him alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat. But...
Yes.
A man doesn't always know why he does things, Louis. I think I did it because your daughter ain't ready for her favorite pet to die.
Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed.
I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.
Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be excused. Go and wash your face.
Well, honey...you know that...
You better get going, hon.
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
My dory.  The Jolly Mon.  Where is it?
We got that part.  Anything else?
No!  You gave your word!
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
Simple.  I have something you won't more than anything.  The way to free you from the curse of the treasure.  You have something I want -- more than anything.
Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
Jack, I don't trust you, and that's a fact.  Never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that.
See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.
I'll watch my back.
Maid or not, it fits you.
Boy overboard!
Commodore, you can't do that!
You're speaking up for him again?
That would hardly be proper.
I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
Parlay!  I invoke the right of parlay!  According to the Code of the Brethern, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!
You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.
Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
I'm glad we got here in time.
If I had known --
Come on!
Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.
Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again.
Say again?
How did you get off the island?
Blast it, I'm already awake!
We're not going to just surrender!
Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise.
Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
Funny, I was thinking along those lines.  How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.
You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
You threatened Miss Swann.
No.
Where does it make berth?
This is either crazy, or brilliant.
I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
That's not true.
Will -- don't do anything stupid! Don't say anything stupid --
Do you have any idea where you're going?
Well, you're the worst pirate I've ever heard of.  You're a man who can be trusted, who can be counted on, and who can't betray his friends.  What kind of pirate is that?
You've seen it?
... No.
He's not telling the truth.
That Jack Sparrow ... he talked about the Black Pearl.
What happened here?
Mr. Sim, when you do locate him.  Do not scare him off again.  Just watch him.  I think you can handle that. Right, Mr. Sim?
Wheelchair accessible.
No, thank you.
I swear to you, Argon, if you don't stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one I ever build.
Oh no?  Smell this.
It's ready now, I know it is.
Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
A containment crew is going to attract a lot of attention.
Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.
Why are there two ottomans?
Oh yes, Icky.  I can feel it.
I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners.
You're afraid of him.
I'm a scientist.  I have lived my whole life by the diagnostic application of fact and the fact is, Argon is going to get whatever he wants, so if I were you, I'd give it to him.
Sir, please try to hold still.
When did you...?
Been out for six months now.
Same old Daniel.
We've had this conversation already, Daniel.
Oh yeah, real funny.  Yuk-yuk. Let's laugh at everything a man believes in.
I don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
Uh oh.  I remember that temper.
I'm going to go out for a while.  I want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment I need.
You made this out of my hair?
Oh no!  Argon!  We have to stop him before he uses the nanobot!  We have to get the nanobot!
That means the nanobot is still inside him.
Yes.
I get it.  You're the goon fetch boy.  The zookeeper Argon calls in when one of his guinea pigs gets loose.
You were looking for us?
All the different ways that I could kill you.
That's impossible.
Mrs. Argon?  It's Sim.
Okay, Barbie, let's get this over with.
Exactly.
Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.
You're not going to print this silly thing, are you?
What do you want?
Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters.  That's the breaks I get. It's the mothers that are always grateful to me.  Here.
What's the matter? Something I et, no doubt. Egg marks the spot—
You have the cutest nose I've—
Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live—
Got my initials on them too. They're cute. They're nice little things - what do you do with them?
Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
I know that.
But I don't want to meet your gang.
Oh, that mob downstairs. I guess I got so interested in the play I forgot all about them.
Fine!  I don't blame her. I know I'm out of my own crowd. I should have had better sense in the beginning. But I'll stay in my own backyard from now on.
You should have known better than to write, Romeo. I found that out a long time ago.
I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.  What does it say about the reception last night?
What's the matter? Isn't there a 'bless you' in the crowd?
Is that so?
Oh, that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see, I'm here to find out about—
Not bad - not good - but not bad. You ought to be able to fool about almost anybody.
A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet?  "Just A Gigolo . . . "
Is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana?
I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
Not on my own beat, no.
—Mr. Schuyler .
And with it came love! Oh Gallagher, you've got to meet her. She's it—
Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.
Don't turn around now - but there's a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us.
My mistake - she's glaring.
Been where?
What do you know about Conrad?
Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
It'll be ready in a minute.
Hello, Smith.
I suppose you know why I came—?
No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
Surely, come right in.
Thanks. May I sit down?
Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
What is it, Smythe?
Pardon me, madam. They phoned through from the Mayor's committee to remind you it's past the hour for the reception.
Nobody seems to want to do anything—  Why not ask me? Perhaps I can offer a suggestion. Do what about what?
Good morning, everybody—  Well, maybe it isn't a good morning, huh?  Anne, did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you?
Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.
Well done, sir. Very neat.
Well, sir, I putter.
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
Well, if I couldn't be a good putterer, I wouldn't want to putter. But why? What makes you think I couldn't be a good putterer?
It doesn't matter.
Bud. Mary Sue ... Breakfast is on the table.
Wait.
Thanks ... I love you.
Oh, George ...
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
Sure you are.
What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?
I sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight Mary Sue.
... Why?
It is?
Mary Sue--C'mon ...
So.
Don't! Just let go.
What?
C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...
That's not going to happen!
But it could happen.
"Changes."  And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things.  Did you hear about Bill Miller?
Did you do this?
Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall:  Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce, Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson, Yellow, Olive and Magenta.
You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
And where's that?
Hello Bud.
The other one?
Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.
What happened?
Noooooo!
Oh God.
I still don't see why we're doing this.
No way.
He won't notice anyway.
David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be "attractive." They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.
I had nothing to do with that fire.
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
Yes.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe ...  ... it's not just the sex ...
Oh ... Hi.
Do they have those ... Where you come from?
It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
Right. And how did she dress him?
Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.
What do I MEAN!  You think this is a toy? You think it's your own little goddamn coloring book ...
I had nothing to do with that.
I didn't do anything wrong.
Why?
Because you're coming home.
Yes.
Really?
Oh my Gosh, Bud ...
TV repair?
Um--hello? I've got like a social emergency here.
What city?
What's the listing?
Why?
I'm trying to be your friend.
You just said very food.
Why?
I have work, I can't leave.
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --
Hello, this is Back.
This is Georgia.
Where are you?
This is not cool.
Are you telling me no?
They're not open yet?
I don't know.
....No....
What did he want?
Did you pick it up from the street?
So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
I'll be around and back in town in a few days --
Yeah.
Ok.
Yes.
Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me?
No. What do you mean? BARRY I just wanted to know. When was the last time you had a boyfriend?
You got me out of my hotel room. You came and got me out of my room.
I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....
For work.....
It's a plastic, yeah.
Did you have my home phone number?
I'm fine, I have your work number.
Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
I cut myself.
Alright, well you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to go.
Of course, it's just for us to verify your credit card information. It's completely confidential and it appears on your credit card billing statement as D&D Mattress Man.
Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service --
Ok, sir....I'm gonna put you through to my supervisor.
It takes that much time to process the order and make sure it's valid --
Why you wearin' a suit?
Which guy in Toledo are you talking about?
I'll tell you...the guy...with...just talk to me later about it, ok?
Ok. Well. I'm gonna go out of town. I'm going to go out of town just for two days...
Ok.
You have an ATM?
Ok. This is what you get when you're a pervert -- you said you'd help someone out and you didn't so we're just getting some money for her and that's that.
I'm sorry.
What are you doing?
Yes I am.
Yes you do. We were calling you Gay Boy and you got so mad....
So they'll go.
Yeah.
He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --
-- he's so strange I don't know if you really even would want to go out with him, someone like him, I said I'd try, but it's just --
Are you ready?
They need to see the new 484's to make sure it works with their OC....
So...did my brother call you?
I have no idea what he's doing then. I'm sorry that didn't work out.
You wouldn't want to go out with him anyway, honestly, he's such a freak sometimes.
I'm sorry. You're right.
Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas.
Once or twice.
I hear he's got a whetstone and chisel, and he uses them to sharpen his teeth.
If you're going to slander him, then you don't deserve to hear his stories --
In part, yes.
I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
But we also fall in love; we build cities, we compose symphonies, and we endure. Why not put that in your books as well?
I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
That's a Turkish weave, you numbskull; it costs more than you'll earn in your lifetime --
-- water! --
A man after my own heart...
A night spent with the partner of my choice.
-- that was lust --
I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
Why was it you never took her by force?
NEVER!
It's a formality; truly.
His wife's influence.
Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
But he's one among some two hundred wards --
A practical man, sir. Given the Marquis' unusual tastes, a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent.
Well?
It was fiction, of course.
Of course.
And you? It must've been an ordeal.
I'm not the first man God has asked to shed blood in His name. I will not be the last.
A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
But I am history.
Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake.
There's something else I want from you.
Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --
-- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet! There, armed with a quill of my own, I'll commit it to paper!
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
Don't toy with me, Doctor.
Hm? Tell me. What other treats?
Not you too
You're just scared.
Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
Listen, you come down and stay with us for a few days. Just tell the old man that--
The actor
Do you?
Oh, why is that?
How much?
Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
I wanted it
You are repellant when you drink.
Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood--
I don't want you to--
Miss Parsons, I have one additional question for you.
I wanna see the picture today
Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
Nix, sweetie. You shelve it
All right! Enough! I've heard this from Schaefer and RKO. I've heard it from everyone--
Magic
Butts on seats. That's what movies are about. You got one job in Hollywood -- everyone has the same job, in fact -- putting the butts on the seats. You gotta sell 'em popcorn and Pepsi- cola. It's all about popcorn and Pepsi-cola.
Like a bug.
Manolete?!
The great Spanish bullfighter
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree. . . "How big is it, all told? The estate?
So speaks the court jester.
I remember a man who wrote I He was a brilliant writer who dazzled me time and time again with his wit and insight--
Listen to me-
This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word to her.
Hearst looks down at the world at his feet Everything has always been beneath him.
Good?! Good?! Words fail you at last! It's terrific! Now I'll have to do some shaping, of course, and some of the scenes aren't exactly . . . exactly . . .
K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
I --um-- I don't know if I should. I ain't been drinking since I started on this--
I want you back
I'm sorry.
I don't give a shit about-
No she's not. Don't you get it, ya lunk? She's using code language to the studio bosses. "Bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees" -- who the hell do you think she's talking about?
This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the Jews.
It's too late. The movie's made
They won't let it out. Not Hearst. Not the other studio heads--
Is that from one of the Gospels?
You know, all this nightmare we went through with Hearst. The whole thing... And in the end, probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway.
Yes
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
For the title
And this is the evening edition. Notice anything?
It's just that my movie is so-
That soulless monster gets no tears from me.
Hold on a sec. I got news. We finally found somewhere to premiere KANE but--
Orson, you wanna take five?
Oh, no--
Yes!
Let's go, Jake, wake up!
Look Joey, I wanna tell you something. Your brother ain't gonna get nowhere without us -- nowhere. And I'm tellin' you between the two of us, it's gettin' to the point where it's gettin' to be a real embarrassment to me, a real embarrassment.
Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. But you know when Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. I'm his kid brother. I got no say with Jake on this. He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
You were a big favorite in this fight. Then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog.
Believe what you want.
This looks done.
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
What was that for? I know you can take punches. I can hit you from now to doomsday. What the fuck does that prove?
No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I know her from around here, that's all. You want to meet her or what?
I just weighed myself -- I'm 161. No more deals like this Janiro bullshit. I didn't tell you to do it in the first place.
Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
What did Tommy say?
See? That's all there was to it.
Except fall down like a normal person.
I'm gonna order up some stuff. Have a steak.
Answer me somethin'. What happened at the Copa with Salvy when I was out of town?
Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about.
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.
Whatever you touched, that's good now.
You're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... You wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month.
What?
Was Vickie part of the deal with Tommy? Was my wife part of the deal? Tell me, was that it?
I'm pulling out of next Wednesday's TV bout 'cause I can't make the weight. I'm fighting at light heavyweight, and I still can't make the weight.
It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
It feels real good.
Just keep your eye on the ball.
Jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.
You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.
You know what I'm talking about. Don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight.
You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it.
No, not that.
I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.
Can't you get the money from your friends?
How's the weight? Ok?
Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister in-law.
What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
Of course, it's normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope.
Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.
Well, officer -- do your duty.
What time?
Who said they left then?
A very convenient guy -- this superintendent. Have you checked his bank deposits lately?
Jeff -- huh?
Well -- what good is his information?!! It's a second-hand version of an unsupported statement by the murderer himself -- Thorwald! Anybody actually see the wife get on the train?
If possible -- both.
Give him evidence.
What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
A possibility.
Congratulations, Jeff.
I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up.
That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
Why should I?
I can't. The police have it by now.
You've got a hormone deficiency.
It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say.
It's very simple. She belongs in that rarefied atmosphere of Park Avenue, expensive restaurants, and literary cocktail parties.
Keep your mind off her.
She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.
Well, the salesman could be available soon.
Thank heaven that's over!
You can tell that from here?
I handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in New Jersey asleep for the winter.
You know, Miss Fremont -- he might just have something there.
Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
Not too active.
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.
What a day I've had!
Tell me -- what was Slim Hayward wearing?
Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that --
It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?
I have one now.
So do I.
What makes you think something's wrong with her?
What are you getting at?
No comment.
The name on the second floor rear mailbox reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars, that's L-A-R-S, Lars Thorwald.
What about it?
Inside stuff?
Night. I'm going to stay with you.
Say anything else, and I'll stay tomorrow night too.
I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.
From his landlord -- once a month.
I'll rephrase the question.
Suppose Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring was among the jewelry he has in the handbag.  During that phone conversation he held up three rings -- one with a diamond -- one with a big stone of some kind -- and one plain gold band.
Shut up. I'm all right.
What's that?
Friend of yours?
Nobody chickened.
Buzzie--we better get out of here.
Meaning me?
What?
Where can we meet?
Jim Stark.
Hi.
Tell him why we moved here.
Sure--  You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
Yeah!
You awake?
How'd that happen!  What kind of trouble you in?
We don't have time.
Ten years?  Now, Dad--I need an answer now!
Go ahead.
Well, just get it off your chest, son.
I don't think so--
Son--this is all happening so fast--
I don't see what's so bad about taking a little drink.
You sure?
I was talking to Jim.
Frank?  I'm frightened.
Yes, sir.
Oh, Mrs. Crawford don't believe in them!
What's your name!
Jim.  What's yours?
I just don't want trouble.
I got to go in.  You better get home too.  Hey--what?
Who has?
O.K.  G'night.  I got to pick up my scooter.  See you tomorrow.
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
Isn't it crazy?
Nobody talks to children!  They just tell them one thing and mean another.
Plato?
Why?
I'm not going to hurt you. PLATO Why did you run out on me?
Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away.
'Bye, Mom.
Hang loose, boy.  I'm warning you.
You feel like you want to blow your wheels right now?
"If he could" what?  You mean your father?
Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place.
Here.  Look, will you do something for me?  If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.
You don't have to be unfriendly.
Now that's true!
Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold.
Well--we're newlyweds.
Ever been in a place like this before?
Why?
Is this what it's like to love somebody?
You disappointed?
Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
You smell like baby powder.
What?
He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
You weren't looking for company, were you?
Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?  I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  Did you ever think of that?
I was talking to Dad.
A man of some travels.
One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
You need a COAT!
Beauty and fragrances.
I thought we'd have a few more days.
No!
Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
Then they do need me, don't they. They really need me...
That guy knows you?
I love you, Nick...
They'll have guns.
We need to find a way to make me part of it.
I'm glad it was me.
No --
Put him in the truck.
You what...
Yes!
She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart.
We walked the place for a week.
You'd have to get me inside.  Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map.
Bring back some memories, Nick?
What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
At least gimme video poker.
A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain.
So. You're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. You're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front.  You need six.
You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need six.  Six is me.
Can't be attracting attention, right?
Get in the CAR!
Ash?
Ash?
Take 'em.
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
We understand you, Mr. Bangs.
We're aware of your position.
What about the Powwow Safe?
Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of the day you don't smoke?
My what?!
Having romance problems, Romeo?
What the hell was that about --
DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!
What's the first thing, man? What's the first thing you're gonna do?
What?
She's gonna be out there, man. Right there. Right there waiting.
Oh.
Don't look like he missed the sunlight.
What, working security?
You're GONNA be there! We're getting outta here! TAKE IT!
She set them up. All of them.
And you set me up.
Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money!
There is no other table --
Alone at last.
I asked you a question. Are you clear about that?
You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot -
I don't know what he did to her, but she got even.
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried.
We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.
How can you tell?
The Brewers.
The Milwaukee Brewers?
Hey, fuck all that, I'm making a point here. You're gonna make me lose my train of thought.
Mr. Blue's dead?
You gonna put it away?
Sorry, it's my book now.
Not a problem, got guys waitin' for it. But what happened to Marsellus Spivey? Didn't he always move your ice?
He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.
Like hell I am.
That's your proof?
Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
You didn't ask.
C'mon, throw in a buck.
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that. So let's get this straight. You never ever tip?
You don't have any idea what you're talking about. These people bust their ass. This is a hard job.
Gun shot.
Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.
I'm cool.
Nope.
That was the plan, we meet here.
Then where is everybody? I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house. We ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could both be dead or arrested. They could be sweatin' 'em, down at the station house right now. Yeah they don't know the names, but they can sing about this place. I mean, that could be happening right now. As we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin' here this minute.
What?
No shit?
I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit.
Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
We had just gotten away from the cops. He just got shot. It was my fuckin' fault he got shot. He's a fuckin' bloody mess - he's screaming. I swear to god, I thought we was gonna die right then and there. I'm tryin' to comfort him, telling him not to worry, he's gonna be okay, I'm gonna take care of him. And he asked me what my name was. I mean, the man was dyin' in my arms. What the fuck was I supposed to tell him, "Sorry, I can't give out that information, it's against the rules. I don't trust you enough."? Maybe I shoulda, but I couldn't.
Oh, I don't doubt is was quite beautiful -
Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground!  I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another.
I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out.
Not these guys.
Look of things, she doesn't.
As far as -- Sonora?
Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?
But you eat, don't you?
They're stragglin'.
She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.
Tell me, darling.
Some of 'em you didn't mean but most of 'em you did. I don't blame you because I understand your way of thinking and why you think that way. You want your women on pedestals. But they have to be born on 'em -- they can fall off but they can't climb back up.
Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.
Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
You've got to -- don't you understand -- they want me with them and they'll fix it so I have to go --
How does she draw?
Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
Can I have my gun back?
It's all right with me if she teaches you, but I don't want you forgettin' your job.
Okeh, I was wrong. But you can't expect a fellow who never saw Lednov and never heard his name until a while ago to do too much worryin'. You've been sorta close mouthed about him.
Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
Maybe you shoulda killed him.
Is that the only reason you came back?
So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
You can light the lamp.  I'm sure glad it's you. We were afraid those killers might come back.
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
What is it?
Just a thing I was workin' on.
Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
Yes, people make me restless.
Suppose I take a look.
With a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other.
We don't want to go there.
Give it back to him. We're leavin'.
Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
U-n-i-c-o-r-n-... What in heck's that?
How about California?
Oh, sure.
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
In room "302" at ten o'clock?
And remember that trip we took to Africa? That safari was so wonderful. Me, you... best of friends... forever.
Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
No, he lost the house after the stock market crash.
He's right. I should go first.
Cindy, I've been thinking about this whole friend thing. I never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... I mean, there's Ray, but he cares for me in a different way. You know, bringing me flowers. Running my bath water. And then there's nights I wake up screaming and I look over and Ray's in my bed. Holding me. And seeing that tonight might be our last night together, I was thinking...
That we should take our friendship a little further?
What about you, Buddy?
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!
How about these buns?
Both of them?
I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
Yes. The scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.
Cindy Campbell. Classic abandoned personality disorder. She seems guarded, but willing to do this.
Willing? I like that.  And, this one?
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
I'm going to change for dinner. I'll see you shortly.
You never could feel your legs.
A little bit... Give me your belt.
Would you like to see the girl?
Oh shit, you gonna take that?
Sorry, y'all. My bad.
Get out?! What does it say?
Mrs. Sutphin?
I wouldn't give ya a nickel.
You said you hated him.
Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
Because it's the rules!
Detectives, what is this about?
I got somebody you could run over, Mother!
Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down!
I can't stop thinking about that poor teacher.  Goodnight, honey. Don't read late, we've got a big day with the birds tomorrow.
I'm sorry, honey. But the birds will still be there next week.
Det. Bradford, I'm sorry but we don't allow gum chewing in this house. 
Who's voice was it, Dottie?
Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
Who is this?
Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company. I understand you're having problems with obscene calls.
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
And we're going right to the flea market to get another one! Misty tells me there's a whole booth of Franklin Mint stuff. Dottie, you lock up.  I'll take care of poor Rosemary!
I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard!
Beverly, are you alright?
Beverly, honey, you've got some...  ...do-do on your shoe.
And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.
Murder, honey.
I'll take this instead.
Can we go there now?
If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.
Drink.
Well, then I can tell you that in addition to other dangers, there is a grave danger of Jacqueline losing her sanity. I would advise against you seeing her.
Why, Mary --
What were you talking about?
Some of us, Frances, must believe without understanding.
You can't make it your life's work looking for Jacqueline.  ) You'll have to do other things... live...get some enjoyment out of life. I hope you'll let me help you.
But you do believe me?
Yes, of course —— but the police would say you'd probably had a bad dream.
Maybe the Romaris might have a room. They seem nice.
You could have told me any time you were Jacqueline's husband.
Mary, when you first came here, I told you to look into your heart. You didn't listen to me. You listened to the policeman instead. You didn't find your sister, did you?
I don't know.
It's terribly sweet of you, Jason.
But who is Judd, a psychiatrist. It's quite natural that he should read books on the history of old religious societies. But why should Mrs. Redi, a woman with a beauty parlor --?
I'm at sea, Jason.
Such a simple matter. This figure is the symbol of the Palladists.
It's because of Jacqueline —— I can't go on looking for her --
Ah, my Jason -- always laughing -- always trying to help others.  He's a good boy, Miss -- he just talks that way.
Jason, my pet ——
Oh, Mr. Jason. I really shouldn't be doing this, you know. It's against the rules.  When did you say you wanted them?
I think I understand without your telling me. I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven't written for ten years.
Following me to find Jacqueline?
Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
Wait —- there is that other favor.
I'd forgotten.
Yes. When I tell you.
Tell me, why this sudden desire to publish — to awaken like Byron and find yourself famous.
She is very young -- I have an old habit of failure. It would be a bad habit to bring to a marriage.
Would they hurt her?
Why?
Yes —— yes, if she made that much impression on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline.
Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.
Is it fifteen minutes yet?
I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
That was quick.
We... don't usually let people smoke in the house. We have a patio if you --
Yes.  Oh, you mean to bring in! No. Yes, I have some other things, no, I don't need to bring them in. This is all I need to stay here.
Yeah, I guess it is. My mother is a complete Anglophile, anything British makes her drool like a baby. She probably heard the name in some movie. She's a prisoner of public television now.
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
Nine years.
Yes. I was surprised that he accepted when I asked if I could stay here until I found a place.
This food is excellent.
Do you want them?
As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.
So you don't believe in therapy?
I believe in it for some people. I mean, for me it was silly, I was confused going in. So I just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesn't know you intimately.
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.
Ann. Hello.
Nothing I can't finish later.
What... what are these interviews about?
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
To you?
I don't... why... why do you do this?
I'm sorry this came up.
I know.
How did you know?
Why not?
When we're making love?
Did you have sex before you were married?
Because that's how Cynthia thinks!! All she does is think about that stuff, and I hate that, I don't want to be like her, I don't want to be like her!!
Have you fantasized about me?
Yes.
Who was the last person you had sex with?
If you do get out of your marriage, will you continue to be inhibited?
I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...
Kind of. I mean, John's like this kind of... craftsman. Like he's a carpenter, and he makes really good tables. But that's all he can make, and I don't need anymore tables.
But you're planning to be?
Not entirely.
Why not?
Something wrong?
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
Why don't I believe you?
Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.
Jesus Christ! What the hell happened? I came home and your car was gone, the door was open, I thought for sure you'd been abducted by some mad fucker, I was literally just calling the cops when you walked in. What happened?
Don't you think that's a lot of garbage? I'd really like to know where it's all going to go.
Ann, do you see a pattern here?
Yeah, so?
Did you masturbate?
Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know?
What do you mean, like physically?
Yes.
That you are under no obligation to me?
Do you feel there is more progress to be made?
Why?
Why, so you can go after him?
"My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?
Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
Fine.
Well, it's too late now, isn't it?
Why?
Here it is.
What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?
Nothing.
Do I sit or stand?
Describe for me your first sexual experience.
No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.
Okay.
No? Not even one more?
I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
Cynthia, I don't think you want to, I mean, you should see the way he dresses. I really think he's in a bad way.
Oh.  Well, when, then?
I don't know. I'm not sure I can duplicate the level of intensity I had the other day.
It's just so blatantly stupid, I have a hard time believing you did it.
Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.
You trust him.
Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out.
No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all.
If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.
Yeah, it's not bad. Usually Ann has some serious salt action going. I keep telling her, you can always add more if you want, but you can't take it out.
I'm sorry. Am I prying again?
Hi, John.
Where are the tapes, Graham?
What tapes?
You know which tapes! Where are they?
No.
Graham, I swear to Christ I'll kill your scrawny ass. Now give me those tapes.
You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
Yes?
Yeah.
Hi.
OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
No, nothing.
Well? Supper at my place?
You say something?
Do you want to make love? You're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. You're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. Do you want to make love?
Yep. She lived in 1208. But we usually went to my place. Bigger liquor cabinet, bigger bed.  She was gone when I got back from my last Florida trip. Too bad. Had a beautiful tan.  Must have gone home to mother.
I'm going to send you to the hospital to have a few X-rays taken. I want to find out exactly what you're hiding in there, OK? Give them this. The address is right there under Radiology.
I don't get it.
Rog, I gotta talk serious to you. Really. Listen. Ya listening? OK. I want you to come into this with me. To tell the honest-to-God truth, I'm lonely.  All Hobbes ever did was run around getting money and phone me in the middle of the night. He wanted you in anyway. That's why we were gonna get together, the three of us. We would have enough to keep us going for at least five years, even with inflation.
It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
NIGHT NIGHT
BREAKING OUT
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
Overreact!  You're the one with theories about conspirac...  Oliver?
Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
YOU'LL FIND A RAMBLING ROSE AND A PICKET FENCE
LIKE A VIRGIN WITH AN' URGIN' IN A SURGERY I'LL BE SWINGING -- I'LL BE BRINGING OUT THE NURSE IN ME
Could I do that later?
It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
Brad!  Oh, Brad.
Just what the Doctor ordered.  I know.  Come on in, my favourite show's just started.
You are the most desirable creature that ever walked.
He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
You've got a really tight team around you.  And everybody needs you!
F for...
I FEEL THE HEAT FROM YOUR SKIN AND THE STUBBLE ON YOUR CHIN YOU'RE NO GOOD
WHAT A JOKE...
We love you, Baby.
You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.
You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?
It's Christine.  Hey you.
Well, then put him at the singles table.
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
I'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important.
Bye.
I love you.
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
And?
And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.
When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it.
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
Hey, guys. How's it going?
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
Great. You look great.  You both do.
What happened to you guys?
Oh, that's tasty.
Oh yeah. Much better.
Whoa, why are we getting off?
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
I'd rather have a knife.
First take your glass and examine the wine against the light. You're looking at color and clarity.
Whoa.
If that's what feels right.
Doesn't mean shit. When Christine was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her. Think it worked? Fuck no. How do you think I met her?
Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back.
She what?  When?
We're on.
Well, she is cute.
You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.
And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
What? Of course I like Christine.
Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph and Siena get home safe, and then maybe we'll hook up with you later, okay?
Call me on my cell if you go out.
Can you give me some room here?
What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
Nope.
Is it the money thing?
You ever actually read any of this guy's books?
So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
This whole week has gone sour. It isn't turning out like it was supposed to.  I want to go home.
What's that supposed to mean?
That's thoughtful.
What's it look like to you?
Fucking chick's married.
Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand.
Yeah.
So what the fuck were you thinking?
The plan is... you go.
Hrnrnrn?
Want me to drive?
Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.
Hi.
Yeah, I know.
It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house. All those times you came into the restaurant. It's like you're a real person now. Almost.
Oh. You mean... today?
Yeah. Thanks.
Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.
Well...
Can I ask you a personal question?
Bathroom over there?
Good. So did I.
Okay.
Ken.
Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
So how're you doing?
I'm pregnant.
Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it.
I told you I need a drink.
So what do you think?
Huh.
What's the rule about getting up in the middle of the night?
What are you thinking about?
It's not contaminated. It's just tap water. Pour it in his bowl.
Does it hurt?
...I will.
Explain noises.
It was very dark.
Should we turn off the lights?
They're on the roof.
Should we make a run for it out the back?
I can feel air.
Me too.
He's not strong enough to fight off another attack.
These are D's; I need double A's.
Dad.
Don't call me Father.
What's that?
I don't think so.
They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.
I think we lost 'em.
Forget it.
You'll never make it.
Where's Jake?
I just came out to say goodbye.
We told Sheriff Cobb about the attack.  He said he'd... look into it.  I can't believe he's the law out here. Now I see why you all wear guns.
My name is Emmett.
I'm just meeting a guy here and moving on. So far I haven't been able to find him.
I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?
Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. I always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. I guess they admired my horse. She's a great one, a sweet little bay.
Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
Where you been?
Cobb, I want you to meet Emmett. He's a friend of mine.  This is Sheriff Cobb.
That's a lie.
He acted bravely out there, Hannah. Just bad luck his getting hit. Could have been any one of us.
What's that?
The other guy drew first.
New record.
Kelly, get over here.  You didn't come all this way just to pay me back that money, did you?  Kelly, meet my friend Paden.
You wanted to see me?
What are you talking about?
I don't like that word much, Carter.
Now let's talk about you chaps.
We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.
What are you doing here, Rae? This ain't for you.
Rae, all we got is each other.
Things are getting messy around here.  I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.
I've given that up.
So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
I told you this was a sweet set-up.
Who's the owner?
I'm saving lives here. The straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather.
Where's the dog now?
I've got a place I can hide her.
I'd love to stop somewhere but I'm late.  I'm on my way to see Viktor now.
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.
I want to reassure you, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and I.
You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone.  I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.
-- I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
You're not renewing my contract.
So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?
They're yours.  But how are you going to finish it?  Without a star there's no movie.
Where is she?
Why not?
Sorry I didn't get her back in time.
Hair and make-up?
Even the fall from the plane?
-- You can't go in there!
I do?
Excuse me?  Start?
She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
Is Simone back to earth yet?
I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor.  Is she really having your baby?
Impossible.
I just read somewhere --
Why?
Thank God for you, Faith.  I know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.  You don't know what a service you're performing for Simone -- shielding her from those animals.
That's true.  I can reveal that I am considering a career in politics.
Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
You never were together, Hal.
Clyde.
Absolutely not!
That's why you're so perfect.  You have something I don't have.
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
I know plenty of boys.
How?
If anyone asks about Simone --
Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
No, that was me.
Don't you have a real story to write?  Why aren't you in Latin America?
The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
Nice boat, Taransky.
It's a yacht.
Abduction?
I do?  Sure I do.  Can we speak off the record?  I'm a fair man.  I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.
My God, you've got one?
It's a hotel.
You're in breach.
-- Is this about the new pages? -- I made the changes you wanted, you're in virtually every scene --
A lot's happened since we last saw each other.
Thank you.
No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky.
Is Miss Simone coming today?
Maybe he can.
You are birth of... what?  A Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era in show business.  All I wanted to do was finish the film.
See beyond that irrational allegiance to flesh and blood. -- See that with the rise in price of a real actor and the fall in price of a fake, the scales have tipped in favor of the fake.  -- See that if the performance is genuine, it doesn't matter if the actor is real.  Once a performance is committed to film, the blood and bones are gone anyway.  Only the spirit, the illusion remains. Besides, what's real anymore? These days most actors have digital work done to them so it's a gray area.
Don't step in the horse manure.
You're a doctor. What kind?
I got an award once. From the Mayor.
Everybody got upset. They had a meeting. Momma started crying.  I don't draw like that anymore.
Know what?
You said the "s" word.
What about Mrs. Marschal?
What'd you write?
What?
You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.
Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He said the play sucked big time.
I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk.  I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.
Yes?
Can I ask you then?
Yes, I am.
No.
What are you thinking, Momma?
It was Grandma's. It's not for playing.  What if it broke? You know how sad I'd be.
You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?
Where is she?
I would never think that about you... ever... Got it?
Cole, please stop.
Stuttering Stanley!
S-ssstop that!
...He doesn't get invited places.
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too.
Nope.
Someone actually... employs you?
No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.
Gene.
Hmmm. This shit isn't bad.
So... what does it do?
Old slave superstition. You sprinkle a little blood mixed with water on the crops, you get yourself a good harvest... So they say.
You'll be back.
Throw me one.
Hey. Could you be a little more insensitive? We're on our way to a funeral for Crissake.
Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
It's a farm, Keith. You're not supposed to shoot the rooster.
Asphyxiation. Choked to death on a ham sandwich. Next.
You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.
Shit!
Yes!
My father and I don't exactly see eye to eye.
What about Jeremiah?
What is it?!!
It gets worse. He's cut all the phone lines.
Bill, you're Chief of police now. 
Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
After all this shit tonight, I know for sure now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood!
Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody --
Hey there, Chief.
Meat.
Where are you going?
My present?
Okay.
Who's that?
Now he's here. He went in Mr. Grant.
You know, you may think you're gonna get away, but I promise you, everytime you turn around, I'll be there, breathing down your neck.
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
You have a great profile.
Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.
I give up.
Shoot.
You know, you're not a bad driver.
I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
See ya, Kate.
Where did you learn how to drive like this?
Mississippi's the other way!
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
I'll do it.
Twenty-eight hours! You're outta your gord.
What are you doin' now?
If I say go to two, it's really one.
Loud and clear.
Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
This is Bandit II. Now, where the hell are you?
What's a Texas Smokey doing in Arkansas, man?
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
I thought you were dumping the chick at the truck stop.
Just fine. What's the weather like?
Are you loco, pardner!?! We've come this far.
My handle's Silver Tongued Devil and I'm here to tell you, your fellow CB'ers are mighty proud of y'all.
Pick it up, Breaker.
Is that Bandit in the lead?
Five thou.
-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate.
Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.
But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him, guns blazing' for that one?
He's giving them up?
All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
What about the sheriff's task force?
He uh -- he asked about -- I'm -- he wanted to know whic-- what floor security was on, then I saw him get on the elevator with the other agent.
You shot me and murdered my friends.
-- Forget about the tissue damage you're doing to the heart itself. Sustained cocaine abuse will segue you from a very painful ventricular fibrillation into full cardiac arrest.  Buddy, nobody knows about your condition, or your drug use. Why you lied to me, knowing that I'd find out anyway, I'll never know, but it imperative now that I see you.
So I guess you're not going.
I said I got his machine.
No, what did you say on the machine?
Without peer?
Answer your fucking pages! I've been calling for fifteen minutes, we need you up here to clean NOW!
They're gonna give on this in the next ten seconds or the deal's off!
Sparazza is rumored to have performed in excess of one-hundred and thirty contract murders, including one of the bureau's most celebrated agents. Freeman Heller. You heard of "The Turnpike Murders" that was Sparazza.
Where's Israel?
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
-- he's doing it then, huh --
Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this.
Right, you got clicks, anything?
So how we lookin'?
Fuckin' thrilled t'hear it. So the scout, the sitdown, y'musta felt it from 'em then huh?
Nuthin', we cool. There was somethin' about a fed being in the building.
I'mma grip and rip girl.  I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
Are you anywhere near the penthouse?
Gibarian.
What do you want?
No?  Who am I, then?
I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation.  Now: What happened to him?
In the lab.  With her, probably.
They shouldn't let people like you into space.
Is there anybody else here?
Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message.
What are you going to report back to Earth?
You're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book.  We are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own.  That proves that --
I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now.  Why now?
She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
I love her.
I don't know.  I can't be alone.
We're taking a flight?
You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
Where've you been?
Why did you say those things?
I think so.
Yes.  Yes.
You don't love me.
You're the coward.
I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from.  I can't explain it.
But that's what happened before.
Rheya, I am not going back.  I'm staying here with you.
Then you'll die.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
Thank you.
I never said I didn't.
Who are you, then?
It put you here.  I'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness.  I was asleep, and it put you into my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And there you were.  Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter.  The decision we make now is all that matters.  Stay with me.
Where did you go before?
Why do you say that?
Followed by non-human manifestations.
Right.  That's true.
You live in Manhattan?
I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee.
I'm sorry about what happened.
So it was "love".
You could do better.
You put me life in danger.
You don't want to know.
Claire...
How long you going away for?
Everyone's all right...?
My ass if falling.
Get in bed.
Hey.  The neighbors.
Why?
I'd identify him.
Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?
Let me drive...
I'm going to visit my sister for a few days.  I'd like you to get your stuff out.
But I got him!  He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?!
No, sir...
Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
She's what?
What!  What kind of pathetic line is that?
So, what are you doing tonight?
You stop him?
Ya set for, uh, ya know-- money?
Mistake?  Hey, guy, get back here!
Harry…
Great idea.  Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home.
I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
Can I get a word in edgewise?
Thank you.  Now, repeat after me-- Spider-Man is a good guy. On the side of right, and niceness, and cute baby animals and all that.
What's this? A cockaroach?
Just call me Spidey.
What if you get hurt?
I hate people with alliterative names.
You should write that one down.
Do you mind if I come too?
Am I?  I'm not so sure.  I used to be sure of a lot of things.  Oh, different things from week to week, but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore.
Oh, God, I forgot to--
Ssh.  I always thought she was a strong person.  She is-- but not for the reasons I thought.
Hello, Liz.
You were the last one to see Thorkel.  In Octavius' hospital room.
But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
There's nothing in there worth stealing!
Yes.  Do you have a date?
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
You've used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed your annual salary.  Not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel.
Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering… the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron…
A bit melodramatic… but if you could prove it… that would tie in your unified field theory, the Big Bang, Kaluza-Klein--
Your dog ate it.
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
Need any more help?
Really.  I'd like to speak with him.
Like it?
Logic.  Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270--  I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
Three's a crowd, especially if you've got to cut your way through barbed wire.  Here's the wire cutters.  Are the civilian clothes ready?
I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and how our radar operates. Could be, couldn't it?
What's your beef, boys? So I'm trading. Everybody here is trading. Only maybe I trade a little sharper. So that makes me a collaborator.
Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!
Next we're going to auction off your department store -- and your stable.
Here's the knife to do it with. Only make sure you got the right throat.
Don't ask me. Price was elected Security.
Break it off!
The S.S. Men are here to pick up Dunbar. They're taking him to Berlin. Looks like he's finished.
You killed them, huh? Both of them?
Sefton!
That is correct.  Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
I'm okay here. Why bother?
I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
It is.
Say, Schulz --
When you get going on those broads, think of me!
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
I don't care if they wear galoshes!
Let me go!
Me? What if she don't want me?
No, Animal.
Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick.
To the Brick Kremlin!
Harry -- I'm blind!
But it's not just those legs. It's that nose of yours I'm crazy about. That cute little button of a nose!
You want to go?
Wait a minute. We have some rights here.  Why is this man being taken out?
Don't worry. We'll take care of it.
No volunteers, Price. I said we're all in on it.
One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.
I'll say it is. You spilled a little borscht on it.
What happened, Cookie? Who did it?
That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
Now you've done it. You've given me nervous indigestion.  Anything else bothering you, boys?
So was the radio private property. So was Manfredi and Johnson.
Three hundred and sixty-fifth Bomb Squadron? Out of Chelveston?
Are you questioning me?
Don't bother, Sefton. I don't like you. I never did and I never will.
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
Good morning, Sefton.
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
Where is he now?
Data, are you all right?
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?
It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
What?
I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
Looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while. How do you feel?
The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.
We're within visual range of the energy distortion, Captain.
Your "sixth sense"- I've always wondered where it came from.  And what about Soran?
Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.
Yes, where would you go?
I don't understand.
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
No, no, it's not. It's better.
That's right.
But I do have a theory...
A remarkable piece of equipment, but a little inelegant, wouldn't you say?  Have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little more...normal?
I don't want a science lecture. You were on that observatory looking for trilithium. Why?
Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information and I need it.  Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?
No.
Imagine what it was like, Will. No engines, no computers, just the wind, the sea and the stars to guide you.
Sir?
Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"
Careful, Captain. That's a fifty gigawatt forcefield. I wouldn't want to see you get hurt.
They have found a way to penetrate our shields.
It is a Class D-12 Bird of Prey. They were retired from service because of defective plasma coils.
As their cloak begins to engage, their shields will drop.
Aye sir, coding now.
All right -- get your gear. I'll put you down next time around.
Same sector. Metallic mass.
Underground deposit?
What is it?
Saavik... My god, what happened to them?
How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!
That may be difficult...
This planet is aging in surges.
I don't understand.
Whoever they are, they're getting closer.
I'll go...
If equipment is functioning properly, indications are -- an animal life form.
We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous...
Ah, Saavik, that's, ah, extroadinary. What would you, ah, like to do next?
Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
As promised, she's all yours, sir. All systems automated and ready. A chimpanzee and two trainees could run her.
My father says you have been my friend... You came back for me.
Why would you do this...?
On course, Admiral. Estimating Spacedock in two point one hours.
Count on our help, sir.
Excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space.
We are secured from Warp Speed... Now entering Genesis Sector of Mutara Quadrant.
See! That shimmering area.
No, sir, no response.
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand?
Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.
Who is this?! How dare you --
Wait! Give me a chance --
Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
No.
Sarek... I would have come to Vulcan... to express my deepest sympathies...
... He spoke of your friendship.
... The needs of the few...
What you ask is difficult.
So!  Speak!
Say the wrong thing, Torg, and I will kill you too!
I ordered no interruptions.
We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams.
But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space.
Wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship?
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
Do you have anything to eat? I don't know about anyone else, but I'm starved.
I still don't under --
Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
Carol!
How can you let them pull that stuff on you? They're just lazy.
I've tried to warn you. Scientists are always pawns of the military --
Where's Dr. Marcus --
I suppose I was.  I poured a drink. Would you like it?
Is that what you came here to say?
They're requesting visual communications, sir.
At them! At them! FIRE! FIRE! Why can't you?
Yours... is... the superior...
Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
On screen.
Midshipman, you're a tiger.
Yes, Spock.
The word is given: warp speed.
So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your prot‚g‚'s first rare -- a trifle emotional --
Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions.
There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond.
Gentlemen, this isn't --
Scanners and sensors still inoperative. There's no way to tell what's  inside the station.
Regula is class "D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially, a great rock in space.
All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.
Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott.
What IS working around here?
In my quarters, Uhura.
May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
Saavik, get us out, best speed!
I can't get power, sir!
Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.
Prepare for warp speed.
Where must you go?
Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
What do you mean?
That's crazy!
Hi... Busy?
Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine.  I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.
A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
Naturally.  So what is your problem?
... I don't think he understands...
Find it?
Team leader, this is team 2.   Come in, please...
All right. Let's take it from the top.
Name?
Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.
"Neutralized?" How?
Attempting the hell to communicate.
You sure you won't change your mind?
We don't want to be any trouble.
Then --
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
Here... In the park?
It's true... what you said...
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.
All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
Hey! -- Where you going?!
Thank you, Admiral.
Spock...?
The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
Then, this is what it would sound like underwater?
We'll stick together till we get orientated. Bearing to the whales?
Admiral, I have a signal closing on the whales. Bearing 328 degrees.
Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks.
Humpbacked - people.?
Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
Full power, sir.
If you'll follow me, Professor --
... Yes?
Right on. You fly?
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
When we're forced away by the terrain, we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate. The mountains have the highest concentrations. Once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible...
I aspire to be more than I am.
Really?
Androids... don't have...fun.
No... I want to stay with you...
And our people?
Will he live?
Is it safe to move her?
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'
I'm showing fresh air  behind this calcite formation, Captain...
We're taking this ship out of here... this mission is over...
All right. You have twelve hours, Captain. Then I want you out of The Briar Patch. In the meantime, we'll be heading out to the perimeter to call for Son'a reinforcements in case you fail.
You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
Your "Briar Patch" turned out to be more hospitable than I expected.
Right. We have the planet and they have the technology -- a technology we can't duplicate. You know what that makes us? Their partners.
Delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology.
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
Funniest thing, Captain. There wasn't anything wrong with my implants. There was something right with my eyes. When Doctor Crusher removed the ocular connections, she found the cells around my optic nerves...
Full impulse.
You got me, Commander.
We're pulling it like a zipper across space...
We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...
Deck five.
Sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface...
He might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach.
He's activated a transport inhibitor.
No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back...
All injector sub-systems are confirmed off-line.
Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That's not in here...
Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels...
What...?
... I believe you...
Your scanners must be malfunctioning.
Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
He's stable... for now.  But it would be better if we could contact... our friends.
He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed.  Any word from the Enterprise?
Do you know what this is, Data?
It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
Vulcan?
Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons.
Dispersive armor is holding.
We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
What year is it?
Mister Data, I want to know the exact date and time.  Give me a damage report on that missile silo.
Where's the battery room for the hospital?
Alphanumeric lock. We need a password to get in...
Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.
This used to be the throttle valve assembly.  It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship.
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
Entering the upper ionospere...
It'll be tight, but we should make it.
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
Oh...  yes... ultraviolet protection. Thank you. Mister...?
Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force.  And you are?
California. San Francisco.
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
I can try.
Were the two of you... involved?
Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important.
We?
Incoming transmission from the Borg.
Captain...?
Track their weapons fire.
We're still in Earth orbit.
Looks like they damaged the silo...
Life signs?
Yes, sir.
Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.
To control the Enterprise, they'll have to gain access to one of two locations. Main Engineering... or the Bridge.
You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation.  There's only one torpedo left...
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President.
You may need assistance, doctor...
Calm yourself, doctor, the operation is almost complete...
What the Hell's going on?
Three months till retirement. What a way to finish.
I didn't mean this future.
What is it with you, anyway?
Still think we're finished?
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
Are you carrying a surgeon?
"To be or not to be, that is the question" which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk. We need BREATHING room...
He just tried to save him!
Are those your words?
Louder, please. We cannot hear you.
For insubordination.
Torpedo room--?
You're forgetting something.  the data banks say WE fired. If we did, the killers are here; if we didn't, whoever altered the data banks is here. Either way, what we're searching for is here...
Your research laboratory is most impressive...
What took you so long?
He's got it.
That's not his knee.  Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Possibly.
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
Thank you. Lieutenant, one quarter impulse power...
I always wanted to try that.
Just the prototype.
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -
Spock, I'm really tired...
I SHOULD have been -
But I am not human. I am only -
But we haven't run out of history just yet.  Your father quoted Hamlet: he called the future - "the undiscovered country"...
Any reply from Starfleet to our dispatch, Lieutenant.
We've been ordered to -
It's as I said, Mr. Spock: Inventory still registers every torpedo.
I think  not.
We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
You understand that we have lost all contact with Captain Kirk...?
You are me.
Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation?
He was a bit proud as I recall.
The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you.
But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?
And this makes you "sad"?
He is very observant.
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
Why?
It appears to be...  ... an arm.
It's you.
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.
Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.
Captain -- I might have a way to find them.
Imzadi. This is so good.
I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.
What programs were accessed?
Aye, sir.
I won't do it.
I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system.
Sir, we're being hailed.
I think it's worth a look. Don't worry, Number One, we'll get you to Betazed with time to spare.
I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators.
Why don't they answer our hails?
Praetor Shinzon. We’re not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore. Above allyou're trying to decide if you can trust me.
No one knew what to do. Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome. Do you know of it, Captain?
What happened?
It's not quite the face you remember.
There's so much, and so much of it is dull...
Looking up at the stars.
And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.
Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?
I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.
I am.
My God...
But surely...

I don't see anything.
Do you have a good map of Death Valley?
Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?
Elmo's...
Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship?
Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?
I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.
Washington thinks it's too late for that.
You're not hearing me.
You can change a directive, George. You've done it before. Listen to me. He's going somewhere in Death Valley. Lathrop Wells was never anything but a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. There are no roads in there. She was teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling you. We block the four roads into Death Valley and we got him.
We'll do that. But how are we going to hold him? He can change himself into a man. He can disappear.
No, we don't.
George... Do you hear me, George?
You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now.
I won't let anyone hurt you.
What?
What?
Minneapolis.
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...
No gas... car dead.  We need gas. I don't want to get shot for running out of gas.
I...
I need you.
Then let me go. You don't need me.
No.
Do you have a baby?
Say it.
Yes.
The car will stop?
When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
Jennyhaydn.
I don't understand 'friend.'
Why?
I do not want to.
No. Get in.
Please understand. If you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. I'll get you to your ship. I promise.
I must meet my ship.
You promised you would get me to my ship.
I will. I will. We still have another day.
I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling.
What for?
I know how to gamble now.
Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
You could have killed us both!!
Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My mistake... I'm sorry...
What? No, of course not.
The five-fifty. We already passed it. But it'll take him way out of his way.
I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.
That's because the ones that were hurt, died. They couldn't talk to you.
Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
They're gonna let some local cop blow him away.
Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
Oh, Jesus.
I don't understand.
Is there a reward in this?
I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.
Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a sense of humor at all times.  Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder.  See we call it "being wired," but there's no wire.  You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean?
He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.
Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news.  An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?
This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby.  Do you believe that? Isn't that right, Tran?  You pinhead.
Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.
It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
Look, baby, I've watched you create yourself out of nothing.  You're like a goddamn cruise missile, targeted on making it.  And you will.
Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it.
Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
We should talk alone.
The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
I can get you what you want.  You just have to talk to me.  I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious.  You say it, you even think it, you can have it.  You want a girl, you want two girls?  I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy?  You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up?  It's all doable.
Naw.  She won't call me.
You alright?  Y'okay?
He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.
He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history.  They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.
Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?
I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
Iris, man.  Pay attention.
Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
Sleaze to peddle.
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
Fumitsu.
What the fuck are you doing?
So am I.  Just trying to get by.
I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.
I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
Blackjack?  I don't understand--
That's where it gets a little strange.
Lenny, give them the tape.
This is bad.
I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.
Why?
Who's Strickland?
Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
And do what?  Take on his whole posse?
Zorro. Yes, ran it through my files, even asked around: came up completely blank. Thought there might be a Mexico connection, El Paso and all, but nothing. Fooled around with the letter "Z," turned it on it's side, got "N" -- there Ng, he's Vietnamese. The only thing that came to mind was zero, not Zorro. Remember Suspect Zero?
...well, there was some friction: I wanted to write up my work, educate the public, but Koessler wouldn't allow it. Low felt Koessler was more interested in career advancement than catching killers. Koessler had Low reassigned to the Pacific Northwest, Seattle. You know when they say, stick it where the sun don't shine? That's where they stuck Dick Low.
Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
Her name is Karen Sumpter, from near Dell City. Just disappeared a couple weeks back. Vanished.
Agent Mackelway.
What does the Manager say?
What?
She's buried.
The family has gone through a lot. Their daughter missing, the search, her body found, the funeral -- then this order to exhume the corpse.
Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
Mam, it's my truck. I know my own capacity.
Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
You... surprised me.
I don't mean to be rude, but...
Chuck, hello.  This is Agent Kulok. She has a background in medical forensics.
Who?
I don't believe this.
"Murman" was the alter identity of William Heirens, the original "Catch Me Before I Kill Again" killer. Short for "Murder Man." It was the case that got Richard Low and I started in this field.
I was looking for a pattern.
I didn't use Low's name.
Don't you touch him.
You're a disgrace to law enforcement, to the Bureau -- and to me.
Thanks for the ride.
None taken.
Doesn't fit.
Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "I went live last month."
Taking a Stryker saw, cutting off the top of someone's cranium, pulling the brain out -- what's that, a day in Spring?
Don't be too harsh.
Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
Find the feet?
The tattoo?
You need time to think. About the case, about you and me.
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
Hello?
My watch. He toyed with me. He sent me to Chicago.
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
Yes, sir.
He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
There's someone out there, Mack, I know, some man killing for the fun of it, sniffing human glue, without regard to age or sex, without predicable M.O. Someone who has a way to dispose of the bodies. You have access, you can call up local authorities, check morgues, conduct interviews. Be my man.
[Reality very risky.]
Lead the way, Murman.
I've been to Chicago.
Yes, sir.
Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the "item" screams, she chokes. He had a thing about eyes, always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick.
But why attack an Agent?
It didn't feel that way.
Okay. I'll think about that. Bye.
...Monday nights? I host an open mike...
I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks.
Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.
Well, I left someone very special behind.
I thought I was going to die.
Uh, if the guy wants to.
...and boy does it hurt when they ask.
You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
...then ask where you met her...
...I heard it took four days to light for that shot...
It's like, you looked at my tape. You saw my picture. Why did you call me in? You knew I was twenty-four.
I'm sure she'll call. Six years is a long time. You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.
Why not?
It's a rebound.
Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.
You said there are advantages to being single. I want to know what the advantages are.
Hello?
...Six months.
How are you doing?
Right.
Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
It's definitely a step back for me.
Kinda.
I don't talk about her that much.
I didn't mention her once today.
That doesn't sound too good for business.
I'll get a Dewars rocks... 
I can't get over how cute the girls in this city are.
I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
Darwinism at its best.
I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
Ah, there's the rub...
..."A Boy Named Sue". I think that's why he's such a bad cat.
How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing?
You miss the pain?
By the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight.
Pause it. 
...How can you compare them? Tarantino totally bites everything from Scorsese...
Big butt... you know, can't fly coach.
...It was six months, and she didn't dump...
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Listen to you. I got an audition for a pilot at nine and I'm going. You gotta get out with some beautiful babies. You can't sit home thinking about her.
I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment.
We're going to Vegas.
You're crazy.
I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
I can't lose more than a hundred.
Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
Vegas, baby!
Whu?
Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
You won. There's nothing to be sorry about. You're a winner. I'm the fuckin loser. I should be sorry.
What an asshole.
Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
I know she's coming back.
Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.
It's just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new... who doesn't know what I like... and you gotta wear a jimmy...
...and then I'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I'm not even really attracted to...
I know. I know.
Wait...  She's crying. I finish. I hold up my finger like "Wait a second". They sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. I look up and they all start clapping, and now they're all crying. Even the camera guy.
Sorry about interrupting...
I didn't even like her, to be honest.
I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
Don't remind me.
You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
This version doesn't have fighting?
What time's this party tonight?
...Maybe. I mean you gotta hide all the lights...
So, two days?
What the fuck..?
...and teeth... And she's like this little bunny cowering in the corner...
Now go over there and get those digits.
Definitely. Two days. That's the industry standard...
Laugh all you want, but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who's ready to party.
The bear's got his claws back.
I'm telling you. Wait three days...
...One fifty-nine, Two minutes.
Bonasera, we know each other for years, but this is the first time you come to me for help.  I don't remember the last time you invited me to your house for coffee...even though our wives are friends.
Godfather.
You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people.  That little farce you played out with my sister.  Did Barzini kid you that would fool a Corleone?
You're staying home.  You're not going out.
That's all?  Don't you want me to send some people over here?
My compliments.  I'll take care of them from my share.
He's his own boss, and very competent.
My wife was weeping before she fell asleep, outside my window I saw my caporegimes to the house, and it is midnight.  So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows.
Will your girl friend get back to the city all right?
And this?
I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know.
Now that the war is over, Enzo, this boy is being repatriated to Italy.  And you see, Godfather...  He...my daughter...they...
You want him to stay in this country.
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
Mike, you sure about Moe selling. He never mentioned it to me and he loves the business.
I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
Was there a definite proposal?
Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.
Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
And when they shot me father...
Kay, we weren't expecting you.  You should call...
Sure.  Anything I can do for you.
Bookkeepers know everything. Rocco's men are all a little too good for the jobs they're supposed to be doing.  They get a little more money than the job's worth.  Lampone's a good man; he's operating perfectly.
You really want to know?
Michael you're trying to scare me...
Then Luca turned to the other man...
If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?
Would you like me better if I were a nun?
Huh?
My parents don't read the Daily News.  All right, if you think I shouldn't.  I can't believe the things the papers are printing. I'm sure most of it's not true.
Don't you want dinner first?
Michael, it's not true.  Please tell me.
I can help you out...
Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.
Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs.  I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York.  The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt.  I don't care if we all go down together.
That's not how Pop would have played it.
I know I'm not the man he was.  But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.  When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
A million times.
O.K.  How long do you think before I can come back?
Do you pledge to guide and protect this child if he is left fatherless? Do you promise to shield him against the wickedness of the world?
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out.
You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie?
Sure. Any time.
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine.
Is that good?
Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a club, it's not a club, it's a cellar.
I don't like you.
Bastard!  Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in Naples. I bargained for about two weeks.
Say again?
I met him in New York.
Could we sail to Venice?
Without the glasses you're not even ugly.  I don't need them because I never read. How do I look.
You've got to get a new jacket. Really. You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm sick of seeing you in them.
What club?
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
What evening?
Dick -- you've got to hear this!
What are you doing?
Dickie?
What about Christmas?
You should watch that!
I'm well, thank you.
Tom.
You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem.
I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me?
Frances?
What about Cortina?
Marge, when did you get here?
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
You've got Dickie's rings.
What are you going to do now, Tom?
Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
Marge, I don't know you, so I have no right, but Dickie loves you. He's -- I think you'll find he's coming home to you.
Where's Dickie's father?
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding?
Dickie, are you with Peter Smith- Kingsley? I bet you are. My aunt thought she saw him.
Non e questo il luogo per le vostre conversazioni private! 
I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
We'll be there.
Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long?
Not at all. Morning Tom.
What rumour?
It's okay.
Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do.
Tom, are you okay?
Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.
A few days ago.
Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?
Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality.  You interested in an automatic?
Nah, this'll be fine.
Is there a firing range around?
Yeah. I was all around. One hospital, then the next.
Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president.
I don't know...
I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know.
Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out.
You didn't have to spend your money -- ?
But... Betsy...
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
What is your name? My name is Travis.
Ya want me to call da boss? Huh? That what you want?
We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
That's fine.
Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.
Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses it,
We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
Truck drivers bring up Harlem Specials that blow up in your hand. But this guy don't deal no shit. Just quality. If you ever need anything, I can put you in touch.
Fuckin' One-Ball.
Why? Who are you?
I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
But that one night?
Can I see you again?
I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.
What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from...
I... I don't get along with people like that.
I can't say -- it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time.
What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard?
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
You don't have to.
I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much.
I can't sleep nights.
Are you a Secret Service Man?
Why do you ask?
I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
Hey, Sport. How are things?
Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense.
You think I'm too...  ethnic for country music?
Just come and get me, sir.  I'm tired.
What, vou?
Womack ripped it up, right?
Hi.
You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete.  Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.
The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in?  I'll be right down.
Why me?
You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
No, you are.  I know exactly what you mean.  It's not that you're missing something.  It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along.
What?
Well, there's got to be a way...
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
I see...
Sir, are you referring to the fact that I was suffering from amnesia, and I've since recovered my memory?
Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
I'm not refuting anything.
I do.
Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.
Mother o'god...
"It's a Wonderful Life."
Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point.  I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it.  And that's just for the property, mind you.  If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds.  I just want the land.
Pete.  You think maybe you've had enough?
The G-man?
Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
Sandra Sinclair.
I don't remember.  I guess so. Smells like it.  Tastes like it.
I guess I did.
Here, one of mine.
And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place.  Now, I need a moment alone.
Next time, it might be the FBI. The time after that, it might be the President.  But it'll always be someone.  Count on it.
When'd you quit smoking?
No.
The customers?  I don't know...
Said as much myself, Doc.  Can't place him, though.  To look at him, you'd think the cheese slid off his cracker.  Well, morning's half-over.  I'm off.
Yes?
No. Just a few hours.
You're leaving after you see Cathy?
I think so.
I suspected as much.
Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
I see.
I did.
He got a call from Dan Fawcett a little while ago. His chickens won't eat, either.
Mother!
No!
Mom, they're in a cage!
They haven't harmed anyone.
Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that traffic going back to San Francisco.
I don't know, honey.
Why are they trying to kill people?
I wonder if you could help me.
Right here. Bodega Bay.
Yes?
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat?
I need her exact name, you see.
I don't see what difference it makes, Mrs. Bundy, crows or blackbirds. If they attacked the school, that's pretty serious.
Young woman cut herself.
I told you. We met yesterday.
Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.  She's very rich, isn't she?
Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.  I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.
I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
When do you think they'll come?
You're doing fine.
We won't be here.
If...  If... when we get to San Francisco...  If they're already there?
They won't be.
I started to say... inside...
No.
I lost my husband four years ago, you know.  It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.  I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep.  Do you think Cathy's all right?
Yes.
Did you close the door?
What are we going to do about it, Al?
My wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once.
There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's...
Is that for Mitch Brenner?
Monday?
Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.
Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?
As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
Yes, we call them that too.  Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds... 
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
I think you're a louse.
Criminal.
We... we went to school together. College.
I don't believe you.  I think you came up to see me.
Why would I want to see you, of all people?
He was watching a ball game on television.
San Francisco's a long way from here.
I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
So you didn't go to school together.
It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
I'd still like to see you.
Cheers.
What's in this? Nitro-glycerin?
I do different things on different days.
Like what?
What about Thursdays and Fridays?
Some cream?
Are you staying?
It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now.  I think I've got it all figured out, by the way.
Really? Tell me about it.
Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...
Hear!
I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.
Don't let's take any chances.
Can we turn back?
Do you have any lovebirds?
There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans but...
It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
How can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke?
How many gulls did you count, Mrs. Bundy?
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today?  Are you coming?
I'm Donald Fettes.
You have his promise, then?
I'm cold as ice.
But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
I just saw Gray.  What was he laughing at?
He has his own idea of a joke. Perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs.
A burial party -- poor people -- it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely.
It was a woman when we put her in.
I want it --
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
You?  Why?  Since when have you become the protector of little children?
Oh, yes, you will.  You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself.
And you're a fool, Toddy -- and no doctor. It's only the dead ones that you know.
I am a doctor. I teach medicine.
Why should I be afraid of you? What are you holding over me?
This is a gift.
This is a gift you'll not return.
Well then -- I beg you -- I beseech you --
I want to speak to you alone.  I saw something.  I heard.
"A good-day to you Madame Tosspot, and would you like a little glass of something before you take your rest? Come with me to my house and I'll make you my guest. You shall have quarts to drink if you like."  Ah, how he cozened them.
But can anything be done for her?
I'm sorry, Doctor.  Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.
Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
You're not going to Gray.
I'm looking for my friends.
You sent them. I had no choice.
A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car.
What did they give you?
You're him! You're Corvis! We fried your ass. You're dead, man!
When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right?  But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
No. You don't.
I wish I could hate him but I can't. He said he'd never hurt either of us, and I know it's true and... I'm going back.
It's ok, it's ok...
I know.
Could say that.
Fucking crow.
Maybe we had a case of that here.  Get me my kit.
You mean Alex.
Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
You're in with them.
It's not what you think.
No.
They killed her because she found out.
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
Are you an FBI man?
Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.
Gee, I'd like to get inside and see how it works. What do you think makes it go?
Gee! How could they make a landing?
What does that mean?
No -- I'm afraid not.
We certainly did.
We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
My name is Harley -- Secretary to the President  I've been told that you speak our language -- that your name is Mr. Klaatu.
I'd be glad to.  Not now, of course -- with you alone.
I -- I'm not sure I understand--
You know about the United Nations?
I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
I will make that recommendation to the President.  I must tell you in all honesty that I'm extremely dubious about the results.
Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.
We're all set. I picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car. And the radio's still busted, so me can forget about the space man for today.
The boss is leaving for Chicago tomorrow. If I could tell him I was getting married -- with two dependents--
I've got some terrific news about your friend, Mr. Carpenter.
Helen, he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?
Never mind about that.  You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
Is that what you're thinking about?
Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?
Why not?
No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit.
Is it worth anything?
In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
Why not?
<u>I'll</u> have to drive!
The Prince of Darkness.
Did you see that sucker burn?!
<u>Four</u> to go.
I have something to tell you guys.  Not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now I'm convinced my mother's <u>dating</u> one!
What?
David.
Don't go out there!  Stop him!
Dad!  Don't sneak up on people like that!
... And stay outta here.
Been fixin' to build me fence one of these days.  Bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years.  Well, one more day won't hurt. Wanna go into town with me?
You didn't tell David?
I'll hitch.
-- If there's a girl, we could talk about her.
I'm tired now.
What's that smell?
He met a girl.
What's wrong?  Tell me.
You've got a generous nature.  I like that in a person.  My name is Max.
How about a little Parmesan cheese on that?
Hi...
Star.
Ouch.
Do you know where David took me tonight, Star?  Do you?!
I know, I've felt it...
You've got to put this on.
This is kind of a cool place.
I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.
What happened, Michael!?
I've asked him to try and locate the site.  Okay with you?
Too damn dangerous.
Have you come across Fuchs?
Could have been anytime.  Anywhere.
Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
I'm working it!  Nothing's happening!
It's shorted out or something!
But...
Well, who says I want you going with me?!
Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down.  Real tight.
Neither will we.
Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
Right.  Why not?
Hey, man...!
Couple seconds of an Argentine disco station.
How long's it been?
No it ain't there.  Would I be asking if it were there?
Somebody definitely messed with it.
We going to make it?
How we going to try and find out who's... you know, who's who?
We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood.
So what do you make of it?
It's the generator I think!  No power.
What happened?
Yes.  Just about here.
I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
Do you know where they live?
Excuse me?
Last night.
They raise them like cattle... Feed them until they're ready and then hunt them.
I'm babbling.  Good to have someone to talk to for a change... But you need to go.  Take her out of here...  ... I don't have long.
Now get out of my sight, you hideous primate.
No, we created the Morlocks.
And what of the Eloi?
And who are you, Alexander?  Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  This is the world now.  I am fact.
So you take their best...
Now that's what I call plain crazy -- internal combustion is just too dangerous, all those little explosions, never catch on.
The 2005 terraforming demolitions for the lunar excavations sent the moon into a diminishing retrograde orbit resulting in global gravitational fluctuations, increased seismic activity and tidal anomalies.  Can I tell you more?
Got here as soon as I could.
You promised me flowers.
Well there's something new.
All right, what is it now?
Oh dammit, I love you!  I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think, all I do is moon over you and -- hum, apparently.
Holding you... again.
Alex...?!
Why do we have to race for heaven's sake?!
Heavens, look at that now!
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
... One day he'll be discovered by some future archeologists and they won't know what to make of him. The thick brow, so lacking in imagination.  The dim little eyes, devoid of curiosity.
You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.
The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand.
For God's Sake, David --
You care for me.  And you're concerned.  And I have to start living my life again.  I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
You don't know that.  You couldn't possibly.  If I'd only done this, or that, if I'd arrived ten minutes earlier, or later.  If we'd taken a different path or I hadn't fought the man for the ring.  You have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong.
Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now.  The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story?  In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger.  I have to make the decision.  Which door conceals Emma?  And I just stand there... looking at the doors...
When's the last time you were outside this house --  -- or this room?
Thank you...
His curiosity is amazing.
Your husband is dead?
It's hard for me to imagine a better place.  Where I come from there's so much... frenzy.  Day and night.  It seems we're all running faster and faster...  ... All in identical bowler hats.
You might find the truth rather hard to understand.
Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
I might find the truth rather hard to understand?... Can you go back?
You share dreams?  That's incredible.
Want to be a high climber now, do you?
It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
And there's no shame to that.  It's all the same here.  Everyone has an important job to do.  We all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
... It was a great city.  The greatest city in the world.
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
This is where my journey started... right here.
Yes... After her death, it was intolerable for me here... The future had to be better.
Mara --
Don't torture me -- do you have it?
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
Sir, that curriculum is forty years out of date.  The students today are looking toward the new century -- they want to be challenged and inspired, not spoon-fed dusty old equations that have been proved a thousand times.  They want to explore.
No, sir --
My equations are not parlor-tricks!
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
Where do they take them?!
They've gone to a better place.
I'm fine.
Should we be...
He's recovering on the third floor.
In where?
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
Hello, William. I understand you've been asking for me almost every hour. I would've been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about.
Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?
How did you come to know their names?
I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're haunting yourself right now. [Beat] I guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. You didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out different, didn't it?
Look here, I don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me...
I thought you said you never knew your father.
I wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have.
This is really happening, isn't it?
I can't take you out of here in your condition...
And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.
What about Dr. Thomas Becker or Dr. Loel Lorenson? There was also a Dr. Gries, I think.
What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!
Jackie, go play in the snow.
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
I gave you my dog tags.
It's December 25th, 1993 today.
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
[Beat] You bled to death.
What?
Do you really believe me?
Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do.
I don't believe a thing she just said.
You think Lorenson kills you?
I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it?
And if I didn't want to come?
Because I don't think I'm crazy.
My God you look exactly like him.
So maybe Dr. Becker would know. [Beat] But, as I'm sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities.
The future doesn't look different?
[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?
'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it now. When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me. Women!
Can you drive?
You don't have anywhere to stay?
Of course you don't know.
[Beat] Why?
Yeah, me too. [Softly] Every day for the last ten years.
... only for one day and we'll be back tomorrow night.
That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?
Hal, I've told you about twenty times, yes, I could identify 'em, but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this.
Well, you're not exactly an expert witness, but what makes you so sure?
I've been better.
No!
That's certainly possible.
Now, for one thing, you violated your parole two days out.  And you know Judge Hainey.  He hates this sort of thing.  Once he gets wind of this, he's gonna blow sky high.  And then when he finds out that you're a possible accessory to murder and armed robbery, well, I think we can safely place your ass back in the slammer for at least the remaining eight, don't you?
So how come you don't have any kids?
Oh.  I... where's Louise?
J.D.!  Just tell me.  I know you're not some schoolboy.  Now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.
What?!  Parole officer?  You mean you're a criminal?
Well, not anymore, Thelma, except for bustin' parole, I haven't done one wrong thing.
Naw, honey, that would be burglary. I never got arrested for burglary. Burglary's for chicken shits.  If you're gonna rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it.  Just take the money.  That's robbery.  That's a whole 'nother deal.
Jimmy!  Hello, stranger.  What in the world are you doin' here?
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.
Peaches.
Now, my little coconut, what seems to be the trouble here?  Tell Daddy everything.
Will you at least see how it fits?
I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.
In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
How come he let you go?
So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?
Oh my God.
Which part?
Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
Will I be?
Wait.  What?  You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas?
You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way.
Are you sure we should be driving like this?  In broad daylight and everything?
You think you've found your calling?
Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
I... I...
Now what?
What little dogs?
Those, too, but you know those little hairy ones?  Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth?
Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.
Look!  Look who it is, Thelma.  I'll be darned.  What's he doin' way out here.
What?!  What about him?!
Just the look on his face when you...  ... it's not funny.
And I don't want any more Wild Turkey, either.  It's burning a hole in my stomach.
Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
You do?
Yeah, you want it?
You know why.  You already said.
What?
Yes, Thelma?
You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you?  I mean, I just wanna know.
He said they're charging us with murder.
No.
You awake?
It's him.  He's got California plates.  It's the same guy.
And, oh my God, that other thing, that pointing to your lap?  What's that supposed to mean exactly?  Does that mean pull over, I want to show you what a big fat slob I am or...
About two hundred and fifty miles.
What?!
We been seein' you all along the way.
Say you're sorry.
I'll try to be more careful.
The thing's kind of heavy.
Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.
Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about Ted?
Uh-huh. I was worried about you.
I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.
What's the point? Let's face it, Dom, I'm in a slump.  Lately I've been feeling like... well... like a loser.
Whatever happened to Mary?
Yeah, right.
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
You are one lucky sonofabitch, you know that?
I don't know what to say.
Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?
Dom? What are you?
You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act.
What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
Am I?
Hello...? Sully...?  Sully, that you?
So where the hell are you, Healy?
Nepal? Have you been?
What are you doing with all these blueprints?
I beg your pardon?
You know...  ...the guys who ride the short bus.
Isn't that a little politically incorrect?
That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff.
Oh, Pufferball likes his little tum- tum rubbed, doesn't he now?
Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka?
A surprise?
Lint?
Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know it's corny, but I do love it.
Fuck!!
Are you okay?
Any idea where I might start looking?
I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine.
So you found Mary?
No, not at all.
But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids, you're going to put on a few pounds.
Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. I bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you?
What?! You're calling me a stalker?
I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico -- please!
Friend. Baseball bat.
That stalkin' son-of-a-bitch!
You were following us?
No I'm not.
Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you said you were putting her up for a month -- it's been a year and a half.
What's a mook?
The point is, love isn't about money or social standing or age, it's about connecting with someone, having things in common kindred spirits.
Magda!
He's a nice guy, isn't he?
I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't think I'm being meddlesome. I just think you should be careful with this guy.
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
Can I pour you one?
I think you'd better sit down.
I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.
I can't believe he remembered you. He never remembers anybody.  You know I tried to call you for weeks after that.
I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but the thing is I already have plans. How about tomorrow night?
Hey.
What's that?
Now by killer, you mean...?
I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
Nitrate-sicles -- I like that.
I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat.
Yeah?
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
Go!
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
Really?
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
No, no, please!
No! I was pissing!
So what's up?
Yes, sir.
What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.
...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
All right, so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look. Okay? You happy? So now what?
We gave so much to get here. I don't know. Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for?
Slow down. Smell that?
Helen just asked me what sort of arrangements we have for the families.
Still heading for Cuba.
What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.
Busy. But you've got his heart.
Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.
Still think Cuba isn't important?
In the morning I'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room. McNamara'll set up shop in the flag plot at the Pentagon, keep an eye on things there.
We need those flights. We have to know when those missiles become operational, because when they do, we need to destroy them.
What's that?
I don't want to listen to this again.
It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.
Didn't know Adlai had it in him. Too bad he didn't have this stuff in '52.
Captain, belay that order!  Bob, where's that coming from!
Hey. Nice tie.
I thought we were staying on the reservation.
Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
Mr. Clear Moon.
James Looks Twice?
The main problem is, Ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non-Indians. Relations have not been amicable.
Who are you?
This is a restricted area.
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...
Tread matches. It's the car.
You didn't tell me about Red Deer Table --
Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole. I'm giving you a break. But if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security.
But he is not unhappy with you because he knows you.
What did he say?
He said he doesn't know.
Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him. I'm late.
Not no more.
You had a vision. You had yourself a vision. A man waits a long time for a vision. Might go his whole lifetime and never get one. And along comes some instant Indian with a Mastercard and brand-new shoes, has himself a vision.
Sorry.
Jesus. Oil?
He's gone.
They got us sealed. What are we gonna do?
You bought her some time, Kola. Ain't never gonna be over... but you bought her some time.
You take care.
I desecrated it?
What?
I read, Cooch.
Yellow bird... is gonna sing.
Ray...
Mister Tully.
At Sioux Falls Pen?
What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English!
I thought he'd never leave.
Well, what you need...what you have to keep looking for...what you want to get is a wingman who can stay up with you. Who can match you move for move. Then you've got something.  I'm sorry.
What are you talking about?
What if he's not?
Make what?
Anything.
You're horrible
What he said..."There's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result."
You always get what you want?
I want it understood.
No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
Danger?
How do you play reality.
Want to play the game?
How does it go?
Now?
One more.
Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
F-14's sir.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
MAVERICK.
He better be kidding!
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
Don't WORRY!!!?   You've GOT it!!? Are you CRAZY?
I've got it -- hold on!
Well, I don't know. That depends.
So I've heard.
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
Something bothering you?
I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
That's Kazanski.
Man, you guys gooned it. Your laser butts are scattered across KANSAS.
YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, MAVERICK.
ICE, ROLL OFF, I CAN SHOOT HIM.
OKAY, GOING UP. ICE, GO HIGH.
I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.
He just won't engage. He can't do it, Skipper. He can't get back on the horse.
Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.
We can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "CNC" --course not completed, no explanation required. Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that.
You think I should quit?!
Not something they tell dependents.
You think I shouldn't fly.
What happened to number five?
Well, Cohaagen, I have to hand it to you...This is the best mindfuck yet.
That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
Kill him.
Your sexual orientation?
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.
Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.
You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.
I want that fucker dead.
Level 2.  Galleria.
I've got a weak signal over there.
Who is she?
Let's do it.
Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.  You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring!  --I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute.
Well...What do you say?
Take it easy.  Tell me exactly what happened?  Why would "spies" want to kill you?
Let me finish!
Forget Rekall, will you!  These men were going to kill me...
Not talk!  I said TALK!!
You think I'm an idiot?  Remember our wedding?
And falling in love?
Then I can pull this trigger, and it won't matter.
Mars.
Let's see...the basic Mars package will run you just eight hundred and ninety-nine credits.  That's for two full weeks of memories, complete in every detail.  --A longer trip'll run you a little more, cause you need a deeper implant.
Come on, don't bullshit me.
I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't know the difference.  Guaranteed, or your money back.
All right.
No options.
Go on.
I didn't lose it.  Cohaagen stole it. He found out that Hauser switched sides,-so he turned him into somebody else.  Me.
This is too weird.
Why would I lie to you?
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
I'm not falling for it.
So you dropped by to apologize?
I used to model for 'em, why?
All sorts of things.  You might even remember you loved me.
He's lying.
Are you all right?  Are you still you?
You sure about this?
...Who are you?
Jesus Christ, we're only going nine miles.  Be there in two hours, tops!
She's got my vote.
I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record...  That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now.  Right.
You're really leaving, huh?
If there was one nearby I'd probably ask him.
Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.
Well, sure.
Tammy Lynn Baxter.
If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
Oh, Jesus!!
Well, folks, what's the plan?
You're right, don't matter where they come from.
Come on, everybody!  We gotta run for those rocks over there!
Well...that's it.  We're not getting off this rock...
They're...they're trying to make us move!
Somebody paying you to do this?
You are so full of shit...
Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those.
Down, honey, down.
That's the sky that's going to be over our roof every night, when we're done.
Come on.  Get away from it!
Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs.  You know, they measure vibrations...
Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
Think it's still following us?
...we had to lick his boots clean.
That-a-boy. Hospital.
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
Forensic ballistics isn't an exact science, is it?
Gimme back my bottle.
I move that the witness's testimony be stricken. He has clearly been terrorized by the prosecution, he's --
Clyde, you wait here.  Glenn, got a minute?
You can't remember that -- !
Not at all --
At the trial, you said you were at your apartment that night. Alone.
A Complaint Follow-Up form.
-- Listen: "November 5, 1980. Cecil Stipe walked into 5th Precinct. Says he witnessed Chin shooting, saw suspect's picture in Post. Says Shu Kai Kim wrong man."
That DD-5.
-- Yeah?
You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?
They could've been brothers. It's why the eyewitnesses picked Shu.
"The killer wasn't Chinese"... Cecil Stipe was right. .!
Start looking into the Joe Boys -- who assigned the hits in 1980, what rank generally did the hits...  Your extensive law enforcement contacts should be of some use.
Eddie... A guilty client's not the end of the world...
...I'm dying out there.
It's in the area of narcotics, Mr. Reynard, that the government tramples on the Fourth Amendment.
Are you implying that my motives are less than sincere?
What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal.
Please don't bullshit me, Mr. Reynard. You've got witness problems, you've got proof problems...
That's right.
Isn't it a fact that the "six other Asian men" in the line-up were all of the classic Mongoloid type, whereas Shu has the distinct facial bone structure of a Korean?
Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification.
We just discovered him, your Honor! His appearance is critical to a fair presentation of our case! He is an inmate at Ossining Correctional and --
The witness is recalcitrant, your Honor -- I had to personally make a body attachment this morning -- it took two Marshalls to drag him here!
-- Can't Mr. Dowd find his own expert witness, your Honor?
I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
I knew Jimmy Chin. The boy who was shot. Okay?
-- Roger --
Mr. Ortega... What is "La Compania"?
I'm a soldado in the G-Wing Regiment.
"Materiel"? What do you mean by that?
...A soldado, he takes care of it.
Mr. Ortega, what is Shu Kai Kim's rank within La Compania?
Isn't it unusual for an Asian to be accepted into a Cuban prison gang?
You're a l-lawyer?  I... I haven't had my meds, or m-my vital signs t-taken yet. I...
CIA?
She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
The stuff we got last night.
I'm here to investigate the murder of Teresa Banks.
Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
Mrs. Simmons owns the trailer and she lives in town. Teresa rented it about a month ago.
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
What?
QUICKLY MEN... WORD ASSOCIATION, COOP. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?
Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the Blue Rose meant.
I cracked the Whiteman case with this.
Ever see her with someone else?
Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
You know, I never told anybody, but once for about three days, just before her time, Teresa's arm went completely dead.
Shorthand. Really?
Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
A blue rose.
What did Gordon's tie mean?
That's what I heard.
She lived alone.
When he says, "Discussion", how do you take that, Agent Desmond?
You didn't do your homework?
Noooo...
Well, why not?
Call me.
No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
You mean Fred and Ginger?
I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
You're not mad at me?
Yep. You're right. That's why I'm here.
You missed somethin', Ed.
I did? I didn't see anything.
Bob.
But Bob isn't real.
No... No...
Laura, you didn't come and see me today.
Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
No, it doesn't... just kiss me.
You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
See what?
Johnny, Johnny... let your Daddy and your Uncle and Leland talk.  Ben... Leland, we can play the French against the Norwegians. What do the French love more than anything?
Sex?
You're getting warmer.
History is on our side, Ben. It's no accident that the great explorers were named Hennepin, Nicollet, Marquette.
Fish eyes?
I'm sorry, Mom.
School?
Dad... Dad... Who was that? How do you know him? He looked familiar. Have I met him?
No.
Dad?
Did you come home during the day last week?
Leland...
Shelly, would you give Laura a quick hand with the "Meals on Wheels"?
What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
There's no one here.
Mr. Abraham...
I'm fine.
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
Nothing.
Very good.
You thought it was just.
What are you doing here?
I... yes.
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie. When were you lying?
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
How is that?
'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Nothing further, your Honor.
...I was one of a group of...
Thank you. When Debby...
We went to Code Blue...
...We did everything we could...
Dr. Thompson. From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.
I'm afraid that's not true.  Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
I am seventy-four years old.
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
I appreciate -- a man as busy as --
Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.  Her doctors murdered her.
I understand.
Thank you...
...that's perfectly all right.
Yes...
One hour.
And did you write the numeral 'one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
I did.
That's it...?  Come on, guys... life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.  Frank: I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand... and that's a lot of money... and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Sustained. Yes. The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
Do you want me to go...?
You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.
What is that to you...?
You're pressuring yourself...
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
Kathy Price.
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
...fifty thousand dollars?
It's a long road that has no turning.
You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...'
No.
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine. Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.' Can you get out tomorrow? How come she isn't speaking up.
Been a long time, huh...?
What happened, Joey...?
I can't talk now.
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
'You guys are a bunch of whores... uh... loyalty... you don't care who gets hurt... you don't have any loyalty...'
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.  We were trying to restore her...
Yes.
Yeah.  No sense stayin' out here.
It's an enemy sneak attack.  Let's get outta here!
Is that it over there?
Did it do you any good?
Why, sure -- I got it!  Do you have a match?
I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.
Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!
It's gone now.
Don't you live at home?
I stayed right by the door - praying for the one who loved me best to come and find me.  It was Uncle Matthew who found me.
He liked you ... I could bawl my head off!
I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
That's what knocked the phones out, too.
I got a message for you.  You're the guys from Pacific-Tech, ain't you?
There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!
Not all.  Radio is out.  But our field phones are okay so far.
That's because we want a chance to observe them.  This is the only place we've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them.  What happens here will be a guide to all other operations. The minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops, I'll get my report to Washington.  You've deployed your forces well.
Better'n a lion farm or a snake pit. We won't have to feed it!
They'll understand us, all right!
We did.  Bad mistake.  The fans are clamoring for more. So, Evil never dies, right?  Anyway, a while back we got a call from Wes.  He's got this idea.  And who better to resurrect Freddy than his creator?
Come on.  Kids love horror.
And I...I've got other things happening.
Maybe.  Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.
No.
Ms. Langenkamp.  I'm afraid there are no evening visiting hours in Intensive Care.
This is going to give you nightmares.
I can't sleep there, Mommy.  Please!
You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?
I know what he's doing is bizarre, but most of the time he seems so normal, so well adjusted.  I just can't believe it's him.  I mean, and not something outside, influencing him.  Or is that how denial works?
I know how Chase really died.
Heather Langenkamp?
Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.
No, Rex is not going to die.  Julie, you know where the sewing stuff is, don't you?
Me?  Why me?
Choice?  What kind of choice?
Yes?
Oh, hi.  I'm fine, Sara.  My God, a voice from the past!
Uh...sure...when?
No time like the present.  The car will bring you.
Coffee'd be nice.
Looks like weather.
All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.
Yes, Sir.
What do you mean?
Why don't you go and try some of that on?
Look, meet us out front when you're through.  If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.
Ninety-six.
Feels different doesn't it?
That we're going back.  I don't want it to end.  I don't want to be what I was when I left.
Hey, shut up will ya?
Can we talk?
Honey, did you know that the Albatross was captured by the Germans during World War II?
How ya doing?
Forget it.
I'm used to spending a lot of time alone.  I guess that's what I thought it would be out here.  But, it's not is it?
Ya know... "It".
Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?
That's how he died you know.
My brother.  He fell out of the old beech tree.  Broke his neck.  I was on a camp out.  They started going at it, throwin' things, a real knock down...  They didn't find him 'till the next morning.  They didn't even know why he was up there.
Uh, huh.
The Dolphin was a symptom.
Of a fight he can't win out here.
They have every right Chuck.
And I would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here.
Well, we thought we'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece.
What's that?
They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
Jesus.  She's got guns.
They think we're carrying Cuban refugees.  Skipper, they mean to board us.
Why, man?
About yourself?
You've gotta be kidding?
But, they don't speak English.
Joy, rapture...
Except, a "White Squall".  With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys...
Yes.
I understand.
What's that supposed to mean?!
Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
Sorry, gentlemen. I'm 'most finished on my shoppin' here.
You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
Get out.
You an indian?
No... I don't think so, man.
She really say she was pregnant?
What's she doin' here?
She's my girl... She's drivin'... That bother you?
Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
Actually, I'm lookin' for Marietta's daughter, Lula. Her and 'er beau took off the other day. Marietta's real upset about it.
Woman drivin' down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle. She called the police and they came over and arrested me. Thought I was a sniper! Boys at the VFW loved that one. Cops didn't understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property. I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger. I was gonna put out poison, but I was afraid somebody's cat would eat it. Hell, I had six cats myself. So I used the .22 because it didn't make much noise and the ammo was cheap.
Are you going to provide me with an opportunity to prove my love to my girl? Or are you gonna save yourself some trouble and step up like a gentleman and apologize to her?
In what capacity?
Do you know how it came about that copper wire was invented in Scotland?
I'll hire a hit man if you don't want to help me stop this thing. I'll call Marcello Santos.
Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
Maybe I was there, but I didn't see anythin'. All I know's that trash killed a man with his bare hands. Hands which are now prob'ly all over my baby!
I got some news, Marietta. Lula and Sailor been here. They checked out of the Hotel Brazil on Frechman Street yesterday.
I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
You won't of missed much.
You ain't actin', mama.
My daddy ain't never killed nobody, has he, mama?
I'm sorry, sweetie. I forget some moments where all you been the last two years.
Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all. Don't need to make more'n it was.  This couple's goin' on a date to Hawaii. The girl chose him over the other two guys.
Sailor?
Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? It'd make the future so simple and nice.
Prob'ly the rain boys from Outer Space.
He's twenty-four now? A year older than you? And must be 'bout bald.
You up for that?
I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would.
...That's an awful long way to go, just to get some pussy.
She just rolled over onto her stomach and stuck her ass up in the air. I slid my hand between her legs and she closed her thighs on it.
Her face was half-pushed into the pillow, and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said, 'I won't suck you. Don't ask me to suck you.'
It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
It's just another case, Sailor.
Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.
Let's get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place. Feelin' all that voodoo...
You think he saw us?
Uh huh.
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
Sure is a big deal round here... Alamo Road, Alamo Street, Alamo Square, Alamo Buildin', Alamo Alamo. They ain't forgettin' about it in a hurry. That's the thing 'bout memory? Some things you wish you could forget... What's troublin' you, sugar?
We all got a secret side, baby. Hope you don't think I been lyin' to you 'bout other things, sugar.
There's worse places, honey.
What's that?
Let's leave here.
That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.
What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there.
LULA!!!!
I'll bet.
In the Ganges near Varanasi to try and reduce human pollution and now plan to put in the crocodiles to devour floatin' corpses dumped by Hindus too poor to pay for cremation.
You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.
I'm goin', mama. No way I can't go.
Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
Yes... Get rid of him.
How would I do that? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii?
Simple? Kill him? How?
NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?
Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
No... But...
That's just another part of the price to pay.
...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula?
Just passin' through on my way to who knows where...
Yeah... But I did... And I told you all about it...
That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?
What he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. It lives in the mind.
I like what you've done with it. When's Captain Nemo moving in?
Mm.
It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort of... tinkering with it.
Trip??
He's a boxer. A flyweight.
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
Shit.
Good idea, Crabs. Only one problem. I don't know where they live.
It's a little late to call Admissions.
Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit the new corporate profile.
So tell me about you and the Chancellor.
Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his car.
The hood jumper?
Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those stories.
The jacket, Tripp. We need the jacket.
No. But I don't think that matters.
Excuse me?
It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the caps anymore.
Boy or girl?
Yes. But that's not why I called...
It's very convincing.
You're not like my other teachers, Professor Tripp.
Well...
I guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this.
You?
That's a big trunk. It fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly.
No thanks. I'm fine without them.
Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the auditorium.
Afraid so.
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
Blocked.
No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
Maybe...
Colon cancer.
It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a small town.
Jesus...  Look, James, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least  ...we abstain.
Because of my coat?
You're lying.
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
No thanks.
Thanks for that. He all right?
Ail right. By the way, his friend...?
Look, Hannah. When you get him home... make sure he's all right. Before you leave. Okay?
The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.
Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of commission.
It's just that, you know, I was thinking about how, in class, you're always telling us 'that writers make choices -- at least the good ones. And, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the book isn't really great -- I mean, really great -- but at times it's, well, very detailed, you know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses and all the dental records and so on -- and I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it sort of reads, in places, like, well, actually, like...  ...you didn't make any choices at all. And I was wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you wrote, you weren't always... under the influence.
Professor Tripp.
I got the message you called.
So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.
Is the thing -- is it over?
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
Not have it.
Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
James Leer.
What's he doing out there?
Oh?
Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
That's a nice greenhouse.
Grady?
Excuse me?
Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
The perpetrator.
I might have his number on campus.
Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour...
You doing okay?
Oh man, that kid takes himself real serious.
But maybe it's not so healthy being so close, you know, to a school.
How is she?
Is it because of Anna?
You need a table.
It wasn't like that.
She's got all this new furniture now. She said it didn't fit anymore, so I kept it in the attic. I thought you might like it.
I've got some pictures.  Want to see?
Soon.
Next week? The week after?
Isn't it?
You don't have to tell me this.
I'm not pretty.
What's up?
Yeah.
And when you sit by the window, watching the girls in the little cotton skirts parade by, do you wave your wanger at the girls? Is that when you jerk off?
Sure they do. But outside they've got trees around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature's symbiotic relationships.
Do you believe in them?
I'll be asking the questions.  Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts?
No.
I didn't say what time the assault occurred.
You said last night. I went to bed pretty early.
The passionate one?
Walter.
Are you sure?
What's her name?
How do you know?
The job's okay.
It's called sarcasm, Dr. Rosen.
Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
I don't understand.
That's right.
I'm still thinking about it.
You don't like coming here, do you?
But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter.
Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
How do you feel about that?
What are you afraid will happen?
I'm not afraid. I'm just saying that Carlos has a thing for his daughter, and if he isn't careful he's going to suffer.
Do you think you're crazy?
I suppose it's however society defines it.
What is your idea of being normal?
What is your idea of being a Jew?
What did you think would happen?
When I say the word "girl" what is the earliest image that you can remember?
I don't see --
In my bedroom, sleeping.
Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.
It's going to take time, Walter.
Want a ride?
Here's this nice, hard working guy who suddenly appears out of the blue and rides the bus to and from work. I mean, who rides the bus anymore?
Very weird.
You don't hang out with the other guys.
Are you?
I'm not easily shocked.
Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole.
What for?
Twelve years in prison?
No. Prison is time. That's it. You think time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats... time.
What odds?
I got poked around... here and there.
No you don't.
Right through the brainpan.  Deader'n dogshit, boss.
Okay, good reason.  Then what?
You done impressing yourself, ace?
Bud!  Hippy's on the bitch-box.  It's a call from topside.  That new company man.
What's goin' on, Boss?
I'm taking you back out.
I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?
No.
Need some help?
Bud, something really important is happening here.
Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--
No.
You dumb jarhead motherf--
I think it likes you.
You owe me one, Virgil.
I can't afford slack, Brigman.
Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
Come on, man.  What else could it be?
He's convulsing!
Y'all could be more specific.
We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.
Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna be fancy.  When he gets down there he'll just sit, like a dumb-shit.  Unless something wanders through view of the camera, you'll get nada.
Would we see the flash?
But your friend is waiting downstairs.
But why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you, Anna. Isn't I that enough?
No. It's not enough... I told you before that I would like to get away for a while and be alone.
To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.
But even here we were supposed to find who knows what... And all we bring back with us is a crate of cigarettes.
That must be Basiluzzo.
I think you're very sweet, Corrado.
And why haven't they left each other?
You're very fond of Anna, aren't you?
I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?
It takes even less.
Let's get out of here, fast... This is not a town, it's a cemetery.
Does it please you to say such things?
But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...
No, Sandro... We should go. Besides, we haven't been in touch with anybody. Not even with Anna's father. We should have at least sent a wire or telephoned... let's be fair, he must be feeling awfully lonely.
Good night, my love.
He amuses me. I don't know of anything more amusing. Outside of this jigsaw puzzle. Don't you find it so, Claudia?
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
Patrizia... Patrizia ... Where's Ettore?
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
But how can you carry on a discussion in this heat?
Up until now those smugglers were operating only around the Palermo area. This will be a nice surprise for the Lieutenant in Milazzo... Call up headquarters. Bring them up to date and have them give you instructions on what to do with this crate.
Very well. First of all, I'll have them search the waters around the island. I brought two frogmen with me... Meanwhile, we'll take a look up around here.
Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses, you'll need some rope and ladders...
Listen, Patrizia... The Marshal says there's a current that passes by here and ends up at another island... I don't know which... He wants to send one of his men over to have a look... One never knows... Do you mind if I ask Raimondo to go with him?
Patrizia, don't start in again... I would rather be called depraved. Unless you happen to love children.
Who?
Why?
I'm a blimp.
He loves you the way you are.
That's not what he meant.
Why?
Sister Marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress Sister. Is that true?
How many times have I burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of.
Hello. I'm Doctor Livingston. I've been asked to talk to you. May I?
Yes.
Who?
At least once a week.
You want to talk about the baby don't you?
Why should they?
Yes.
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
I... I don't understand.
Would you like to ask them?
Martha Louise Livingston.
Would you like to be?
Not at the moment, no.
I can't have them any more.
What else did she tell you?
No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?
I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew.
No.
A mistake...
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
What the child?
And you're unhappy.
No...
She can.
Why?
I really love you.
How did you have a baby?
Why?
May I open my eyes now?
What made it grow?  Do you know?
No.
I ate.
You don't like brussel sprouts?
Someone's following me.
A wastepaper basket.
What do you think it's there for?
Are you ill?
I feel as if I've eaten glass.
What do you do?
Do you remember what just happened?
Agnes, can you hear me?
Are you frightened?
He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
Not your fault...
The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us.
???
I'll have a decision by next week.
Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
You know Martha never comes to see me. You watch it, she's going straight to hell... after all the things she said to me. Then she marries that son of a bitch of a Frenchman... has an abortion. I knew that one wouldn't work out. Not like you Marie. You got married to God.
Yes... I...
Two packs a day.
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
Was there a priest?
What's your opinion?
From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
So, someone else could have done it.
No... not in the eyes of the police.
That possibility never occurred to you?
Shortly after she came to us.
And what happened?
It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.
???   ... virginity, right Mother?  Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.
The sheets...
When was that?
Sister Paul?
There is more here than meets the eye isn't there?  Lots of dirty little secrets.
Oh God, if only I'd known.
Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
Because I am a moral person.
Mary Magdelen?
Right.  What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
Would it stop you if I did?
For the Church?
The father!
There's a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn. Did you know about that? There's an answer Mother. That's how she got out.
That's crazy. How could she find out about it?
Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.
I'm concerned about her health.
She didn't want any help.
And the baby.
Oh, don't do this!
Lay them down.
Hoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it?
Well, there you are and watch it with that hoop.
Are you now?
Yeah, I've blown school out.
Not much cop without 'em, is it?
Ginger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting.
Why aren't you at work?
I'm a deserter, too.
What about all these letters?
Are you going in?
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Of course I can.
I wouldn't be seen dead in them. They're dead grotty.
But I won't.
You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
That's not your Grandfather.
Oh, listen to teacher's pet.
He hasn't.
Come on, Auntie, you're winning.
Should I say it?
How'd you like a dirty great drum roll giving you a clout right in the middle of your solo?
Go away! You've spoilt it.
Oh, it's the way you talk.
Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
I'm not ...
Well, the way you were spouting, like ....  "I don't believe you, sir..." and all that. Yeah, it was gear.
Oh aye, a sledge.
Why selfish?
And you honestly think that's what she meant?
Well, it's nice to know you think we're clever.
Pity.
What's that mean?
And what's it all come to in the end?
You're only right.
Oh, they seem all right to me.
What are you doing?
And we're looking after him, are we?
Come on let's get this coffee.
Stay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him.
Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time ... and who's paying for all this?
Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
Don't mock the afflicted, Pauly.
Aye and fond of fresh meat and all.
You needn't bother.
Paul, John, George - get at it.
Now get on with it.
What?
Oh you are, I know you are.
You are.
Oh do I? You're the first one who ever said that.
My eyes are lighter.
Is it?
And?
Don't exaggerate.
Eh, where's my grandfather?
What do you think are you're up to?
Look after him.
Oh they've probably gone to the canteen, cup of tea, like.
Nerves.
I'll set John on you!
What is he?
Is that you, Roby?
Hell, we're equipped --
... I don't know...
Except it will take 75 years to get a reply back.  Don't forget how far we are from the Colonies, Martin.
Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come topside for a minute?
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
Just a minute, hold it, I'm checking.
Hard to say.
Jay, we've got a problem.  I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability.
It grows on you.
We could cut a section out of that metallite netting.  It won't hold up to that acid, but aside from that it's pretty strong.
Where's it coming from?
Martin, this is Jay.  The intakes are clogged with dust.  We overheated and burned out a whole cell.
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
All right... but do <u>not</u> go below decks.
Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.
You know, it's fantastic -- the human race has gone this long without ever encountering another advanced life form, and now we run into a veritable zoo.
What do you mean?
Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
Well, what the hell good can we do in here?  We can't grab it -- it might jump on us --
Yes?
Don't worry, it won't damage it, it'll just give it a little incentive.
It must have stopped moving.  I'm not getting anything.
Now what's wrong?
Can you get them back?
Look at that.
That must have been when he got it.
What common objects?
Blow the ship up?
I think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat.
Isn't "bait" the word you used?
If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off.
How far?
Air lock?
It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too.
It's stopped?
Yes, thank heaven.
How?
And what do we do when we find it?
We came out there, we'll go back.  A long time by the clock, but a short time to us.
Time and space have no meaning out here.  We're living in Einsteinian equation.
Are they close?
All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  Okay?
No.  It's just too small to support fauna as big as the parasites.  If there were a native ecology, it would have to be microscopic.
All right, tycoons, let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand.
Oh my God.
What would you say that was supposed to mean?
Hey, can you guys hear me?
I understand why you did that.
Would somebody fill me in?
Where did the parasites come from?
That's the part that always makes me feel like I'm gonna puke -- when we accelerate into light speed.
We won't need it then.
No, it won't work and I just realized why.  There's only one hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat. Only one of us could survive.
So what do we do?  Do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now?
What did it do to you?
I'll get you out of there.
Yeah, it's fine.
Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?
What do you need?
Are you alright?
Shit.  When?
I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
When?
What's going on?
C'mon, man.  One more sweep.
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
There's no way a rhino'd survive that drop.
Still got him?
It's alright, it's cool...
Move it baby, or they're gonna be chewin' on my cojones!
Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
Hey, Jan.  See if you can get someone to check out the chopper.
That's what we thought.
Okay, we're in business.
See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away.  Same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers.  The algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics.
I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.
How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?
And before that?
When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.
Think I spoke too soon...
Cornering it shouldn't be a problem.  Each part of this station is basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport module running off external couplers.  If we disconnect them and seal off every section, we've got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal power.  That should give us ample time to find it.
They...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here.  I don't...remember what happened next.
What can I do?
'Bout five minutes.
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
Yes. I do.
Nothing of the kind. Karen and I had a nice talk.
I don't think that's funny.
D-day.
Just like it.
All paved with diamonds and gold?
Addison...
- something about an old road ending and a new one starting - paved with stars...
You have no right to say such things!
I see. And when was this unholy alliance joined?
Very well, plainly and distinctly. Although I consider it unnecessary - because you know as well as I, what I am about to say.  Lloyd may leave Karen, but he will not leave Karen for you.
You used my name and my column to blackmail Karen into getting you the part of "Cora" - and you lied to me about it!
I don't suppose there's a drink left...
Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
I'm tired. I want to go home.
You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point.
Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?
Then you've heard too.
I was there. An eyewitness.
It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.
Of course I knew.
In time she'll be what you are.
Only in some ways. You're prettier...
What a thoughtful, ever-lovin' thing to do-
Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
You're my girl, aren't you?
Wait a minute! You can't hang up, you haven't even said it-
Sing it?
What?
Looks like I'm going to have a very fancy party...
Twenty minutes!
- guilty.
Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?
Well, you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against!
You've been all through that with Lloyd-
I didn't know Eve Harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon!
I've been aware of that for some time.
But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?
But you may quote me as follows. Quote. Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave a performance in your cockamamie play, the like of which I have never seen before and expect rarely to see again. Unquote.
What would you like? Texas?
With the paper to prove it.
It's only one picture deal.
Every day.
Thanks for your help... good luck.
Lemme fix you a drink.
The bed looks like a dead animal act. Which one is sables?
Of course!
Oh, brother.
I'm sure you must have things to do in the bathroom, Birdie dear.
There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect!  I want to apologize for Birdie's-
Oh-oh.
Hmm?
Do you want an argument or an answer?
Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...
I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and then I guess, I fell asleep.
Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?
How long does it take?
That's the door.
You're Margo Channing's best friend. You and your husband are always with her - and Mr. Sampson... what's he like?
He's the best.
I'll be at the old stand, tomorrow matinee-
Mrs. Richards.
No, dear. Margo must go on.  As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy...
I think she would cheer.
Of course.
You won't forget it?
May I have your coat?
They certainly don't waste much time.
I don't intend to be.
There can't be very much-
- and you felt just like that talking to Addison.
I think I know...
You talk just as Addison said you did.
She knows enough not to be here.
Hello, Miss Harrington.
Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it?
Well. If I didn't come to see the play, I wouldn't have anywhere else to go.
No, don't go...
I must say you can certainly tell Mr. Sampson's been gone a month.
You certainly can. Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning...
Well - what do you think of my elegant new suit?
Very becoming. It looks better on you than it did on me.
Really, Eve? Why?
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...
They're your fans, your audience-
Margo, nothing you've ever done has made me as happy as your taking Eve in...
That little place just two hours form New York. It's on my list of things-I'll-never-understand. Like collecting shrunken Indian heads...
How much time have we?
Roughly ten minutes.
Three or four miles...
Karen.  I haven't been pleasant this weekend.
It get better! "- About the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched First Ladies of the Stage to encourage, shall we say - younger - actresses; about Miss Harrington's own long and unsupported struggle for opportunity-"
Margo, again...
- don't run out of adjectives, dear.
We're driving out to the country tomorrow night. Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I...
Lloyd, be careful...
But it can't be! We can't be out of gas! I filled it myself yesterday!  Wasn't it full when you drove to Brewster this morning?
Eve?
You know, I've been going over our financial condition - if you'll pardon the expression...
What with taxes coming up - and since I'm a playwright and not an oil well operator - well, I've been thinking...
Now just a minute!
On her knees, I have no doubt! Very touching, very Academy-of-Dramatic Arts!
Margo - and Bill - want us to meet them at the Cub Room tonight, after theater. For a bottle of wine.
Darling, I didn't promise Eve anything. Just said I thought she'd be fine for the part, but there were some practical difficulties...
Such as?
There you are, both of you. Max, Karen has decided it's time to go.
How's the new one coming?
Don't you think it's about time it became important?
What do you mean?
I don't think I could be.
You said yourself my inventory was in good shape - all of my merchandise put away. To keep her here with nothing to do - I'd be standing in her way... and you need her, Max.
But what could she do?
Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?
What the hell were you doing rewriting my story--
--it was fine the way it was--
Forget it, the main thing--  --did you call me a failure?
Goddamnit--
I don't get it... this really was my turf...
It's not us, they were scared before we got there.  What do we know?
Anything you've got.
And that something's got to be more than just Hunt, Liddy, and the five burglars--those indictments are gonna be bullshit when they come down. What else do we know?
Who'd you vote for?
Segretti criss-crossed the country over ten times in six months--and never stayed anyplace over a night or two.  Switch to another station, huh? You're driving me crazy with that.
It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon.
Who?
--fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats--
The telephone calls... we know about that.
Any idea what he did?
--Teddy Kennedy?
Donald Segretti?
Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.
I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this--all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.
It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the OK from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the OK from the President.
--you got more than one source?--
--he was going to go into law practice with Segretti.
--no--
--there's nothing new in it--
--you don't really think you're being followed?
This girlfriend of mine at the Committee, the other day she went back to the D.A. to tell the things the FBI didn't ask her. That night, her boss, he knew what she'd done. They control everything; that's how they know it all.
FBI too?
All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
...No... never in so many words...
Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
Which people?
The ones who could disburse the money.
'Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore--  --I think the place is bugged.
What do you want to know?
Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
I don't know titles.
--his dialing finger must be falling off--
Look, I told you inside--
So?
She's an awfully good reporter--I can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you?
I saw the flag signal--what's up?
If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
Why did they do all this for Chrissakes?--what were they after?
How grand?
Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti.
--I know, I know, the pressure's off the White House and it's all back on the Post--
Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--
James McCord.
Where?
We're going to need lots of good luck, aren't we?
--nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions--
I did all right on McCord.
You can't believe that.
So?
As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.
Thanks coach.
Christ!  I didn't say you were out of the game!
Uh...you know, my friends call me Nova -- as in Casanova.
Look, Chris.  There are just some things you need to learn, that's all.
Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.
Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
I had no idea you'd be this good!
Just go!
Um...Chris --
Forget it.
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
That's nice.
Well, State's got a good business school.  And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  Green peppers?
You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
What's that?
What?  We both have cars.
Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet.
Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex.  You've never even had one manually?
You got it, stud.
Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped.
Ow, what the hell?
Hey, where's Finch?
You can send me the address too.
Back out?  You don't need <u>us</u> to get laid.  You afraid or something?
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.
Yeah, bring it on!
Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do?
She's a mermaid, dude.
Ooh, here's an easy one:  "Attractive SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion." Okay..."Attractive"...ugly.
Yes.  No.  Yes.
So you need to change, right?
I am sorry, Jim.  I suppose we will not be doing any studying now.
"Dear Ms. Hughes.  We're sorry, but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months, we've decided you are now rejected.  Enclosed is a 100-page, full-color brochure on how rejected you are."
I think "shithead" really says it.
Yeah, are you?
I don't know.  How do you?
What?  Not <u>the</u> Bible?
You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.
Say that again, Kevin?
Qualify for what?
You ever hear of something called The Bible?
How the hell do you know all these random songs?
Contact, dude.
Okay, explain.
I guess we'll call you two-ply.
I don't know if I want to be doing this.
Also like sex with my wife.
Merde! I can't believe this!
God. How can you eat like that?
Okay... dead or undead... what do you want from me?
A-duh... You're a werewolf. And we, as your victims, have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted.
You were. I have work to do. The publisher wants the transcripts by Monday. Go. Make yourself at home.
Professor Claude Rousel. The one your uncle was working with. He teaches cultural history.
Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.
What about your glasses?
You made me go there. I tried to stop you! You wouldn't listen!
I know where he'll go.
Where?
Whoa...
Well, they are French.
Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!
Pull over! Now!
Do you think I'm an idiot?
That's not all...  Marcel - Officer Boulard was following you.
You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
You didn't know? But then why did you... well, don't worry. It's relatively mild.
Uncle Terrence?
Legume? You mean, a vegetable?
Not that I know.
Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!
Yeah, well I don't know much about chemistry, but even if this stuff works, you better find it by midnight. Otherwise it's -
You better follow that McDermott kid. He's going to wind up like his uncle if he's not careful.
I was showing Sonya something . . .
Hurry, Grandmama!
Where is your home, Anya?
Who's Sophie?
Did I tell you that?
Ouch!  That really hurt!
AND A SONG SOMEONE SINGS ONCE UPON A DECEMBER.
Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
Come on up!
...fish fork, salad fork, meat fork and. . .  [THIS SECTION ALSO NOT LEDGABLE]
Anastasia! It was just a bat! It's gone, dear...
"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
I gave you that tongue and I can rip it out!
Bartok ... have you ever been to Paris?
PARSE HOLDS THE KEY TO MY HEART FRENCH- BAT- CHICKS HANG OUT AT MONTMARTRE WE'LL EAT SOME IN-SECTS THEN GO BACK AND HAVE --
Promise me she'll have her home.
She does.
You gave the orders!
Perhaps you could convince her?
What's your name?
Can I have your autograph?
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with this, because it-I can't get it off my mind, Allison... it's obsessing me!
Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
No, I'm sorry, I can't do it. We- we've blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I can't go in in the middle.
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
I know- because of our sexual problem, right?
Stop it, Alvy!
Look, I told you it was a... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.
Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think-  Aaaah! Okay.
Sure. W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?
Me? Oh, downtown!
Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.
Right!  Where?
Yeah.
I'll see yuh.
Sylvia Plath.
Oh... oh, well, you see now now, uh, that's my dad, that's Father-and that's my... brother, Duane.
'Cause I don't like to get naked in front of another man, you know-it's, uh...
Oh, I see, I see.
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
God bless.
Oh, you... you're very popular, I can see.
what I mean?
Really, do you think so, really?
Really?
And-and uh, there's gonna be all that tension. You know, we never kissed before and I'll never know when to make the right move or anything. So we'll kiss now we'll get it over with and then we'll go eat. Okay?
We can digest our-
"There goes another novel."  Jesus, you were great.
You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me.
No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?
No, I'm serious.  I just got my mustache wet.
You are extremely sexy.
Unbelievably sexy. Yes, you are. Because... you know what you are? You're-you're polymorphously perverse.
Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs.
You don't want me to live with you?
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf.
Oh, come on, look who's talking. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years.  You should smoke some o' this. You'd be off the couch in no time.
Oh, you have my body.
Well, what is your definition of following?
David? You call your teacher David?
G-go on, I'm interested.
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.
Tsch, what'd the doctor say?
Will it change my life?
Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.
Yep. I didn't think it was that big, but it's a major spider. You got a broom or something with a-
Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show? Geez.  Don't worry!  I did it! I killed them both. What- what's the matter? Whatta you-  whatta you sad about? You- What'd you want me to do? Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em?
Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta- whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter?
Was there somebody in your room when I called you?
It's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know?  Better than either one of my marriages. See, 'cause... 'cause there's just something different about you. I don't know what it is, but it's great.
Okay, okay. Okay.
That'd be fun for yuh. Don't you think-
Oh, look, look, there's that... that's that's my old house. That's where we used to live.
Ah? Oh, well, your birthday's not till tomorrow, honey, I hate to tell yuh.
Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
I'm just not... you know, I don't think I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I don't respond well to mellow, you know what I mean, I-I have a tendency to... if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then rot. You know, and it's-it's not good for my... 
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
Yeah. Come on. It'd be fun.
Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine.
Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is keen for me.
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
You mean that...  I-I-I-I flew three thousand miles to see you.
The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.
Why, I was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.
Why couldn't you have been more like Donald?  Now, there was a model boy!
Here you are. There's people out there.
"Why-why do you always r-reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories?  he said as he removed her brassiere..."
Oh, I'm sorry!
I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.
Oswald and ghosts.
Are you?
You know, it must need to have had its leading from one thought to another. You know what I'm talking about?
without getting... well, let's put it this way...
Oh, do yuh?
Whatta you mean?
May I see your license, please?
Ah.
Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.
Yeah, watch the road!
Yes, I remember.  He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
V.P.L.?
And... uh-
If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
Uh... w-we're going back to the Pierre. We're staying at the Pierre... and we're gonna meet Jack and Angelica, and have a drink there, and... if you'd like to come, uh, we'd love to have you.
I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.
You can have it to use. Why-why are you smiling?
I was a great beauty.
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
You're not upset that I brought the dog?
It's going.  It's going.
Poor Mac.  It's been a bit of a struggle. I'm sure Sally's told you.
You can cut around it, whatever it is. You always do.
I don't know how to make her funny.
Whatever you like.  I'm afraid it'll all be too big for you.  Are you alright, Clair?
Why would she care?
Let's get the kids.
What a nose.  You missed your calling.
When does he graduate high school?
I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million.
You need to call your dad.
Oh.  You're them.
Go.
Well, you're a tower of support.
We'll be fine.
Did you invite them?
How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
Don't get it.
Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you.  It was the only chance I had to meet her.
I'm going to throw up.
Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.
Of course we do.  We have to sign our taxes.
Still champions.
This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs.
Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  Perfect!
Otis!
I'm not sure we understand that word in the same way.
You've been through it.  That's how you love people.  When it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you.
Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.
Alright, good.  Thanks for your trouble. So will you leave Sally and me alone right now?
No.
I know.  It's for the baby's crib.
They're the keys to your grandad's flat. Happy anniversary, baby.
Panes!  How are you?
Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find?
He's the best dog in the world.  They're both coming tonight.  Not my idea.
You got your DP?
And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies?
Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
Thanks, Mac.  And thanks for being so supportive about all this.  I really love you, you know.
I meant Sally.
Please, Ryan.
But you're very private people.  You know, there's a kind of elitism...
I'm a little in the puke zone.
Lemon.
Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just about.
Stop being such a bitch, Sal.
When I read your work I felt that you knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  I am Genna.  How many women must tell you that.  And the script is wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and visual...
What?
How's he doing?
Yes.
There's only you, Ryan.  You know what, Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so much... You need...
You're not serious.
That was my clue.
I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know.
Would you, like, marry him?
It's a machine gun.  I thought I'd kill myself.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
I didn't hear me say tonight.
No.  Really.  For real.  Really.
How's the movie going?  Your movie.  You are making a movie, aren't you?
Yes.  Fine.
What did I do?
And here they are!
In the guest room.  I've laid out a paint table for them.
Isn't this a fabulous picture?
So how much do you hate her?
Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
Don't try and change the subject.  Oh God, it feels great!  He's just a little narcissistic, irresponsible and unreliable.
And Cal's this massive adult?
You don't have kids to keep a marriage together, Sally.  It's only five months since Joe came back.
So, um...how was your day?  What did you do?
He's...he's dead.  You don't have to look for him anymore.  He was eaten by a praying mantis.
It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.
So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?
Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
You -- you think I'm right?
Uh oh.  Goodbye!  Gotta run!
He was a worker.  I danced with him at a <u>worker's bar</u> just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I?
I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
Water...water...
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
Out here I'm just what?
Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.
Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.
So this Z...he fancies himself an individual?
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
Oh, no, sir!
Not that one.  Or that one.
Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble.  Now, time for some R and R.  You're invited to the royal victory party!
Of course.  The entire royal family will be there to honor you.
So...you two are in love?
Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
Your majesty, I'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony.
...I should?
Ask me why we're so successful.
I can't think of any.
You're a real buddy.
So this is your mother's apartment?
Such a racket I heard in your place -- maybe you had burglars.
I've been here twice as long as you have --
Oh, I never catch colds.
Really?
Well, in that case, couldn't you -- ?
Eight-thirty.
You know, I felt so lousy this morning -- a hundred and one fever -- then my promotion came up -- now you and I -- eleventh row center -- and you said I should have stayed in bed.
So I see.
They got a great little band at El Chico, in the Village -- it's practically around the corner from where you live.
A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.
Well, don't tell the fellows in the office about the appendix. They may get the wrong idea how you found out.  'Bye.
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
By the power vested in me, I herewith declare this elevator out of order.  Shall we join the natives?
Of course not.
This is a bad day for me.
I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
No problem. Why don't we discuss it sometime over the holidays -- I could call you and pick you up and we'll have the big unveiling --  -- you sure this is the right way to wear it?
I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.
What kind of talk is that?  So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now.
And where are you now?
Baxter.
Something wrong with your legs?
I think I'm going to give it all up.
Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965.
You really think so?
As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
Pick up your cards and let's go.
I would.
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
As a matter of fact, I'm a pretty good cook -- but I'm a lousy housekeeper.
You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.
Some people take, some people get took -- and they know they're getting took -- and there's nothing they can do about it.
I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You think it's the end of the world -- but it's not, really. I went through exactly the same thing myself.
No, I don't.
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
You don't have to if you don't want to --
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik? I absolutely adore you.
I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
Mr. Dobisch said that?
The Vice Squad?
Sir?
There's a certain key floating around the office -- from Kirkeby to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch -- it's the key to a certain apartment -- and you know who that apartment belongs to?
Who?
Just those four -- out of a total of 31,259 -- so actually, we can be very proud of our personnel -- percentage-wise.
I'm not through with you yet.
Yes, sir.
I made other plans. You can have both tickets.
Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.
Morning, gentlemen.  Everything satisfactory? You like your office?
Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
I like the way you handled that. Well, how does it feel to be an executive?
Fine. And I want you to know I'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me -- SHELDRAKE Sure you will.  Say, Baxter, about the apartment - now that you got a raise, don't you think we can afford a second key?
So it was.  She threw it at me.
I know how it is.
I didn't want to tell you over the phone but that certain party -- you know who I mean -- I found her here last night -- she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills.
That's right.  I've moved out of my house -- I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.
You left your wife?
You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.
Don't mind what?
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
How's that again?
Baxter, I picked you for my team because I thought you were a bright young man. You realize what you're doing? Not to me -- but to yourself. Normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty-seventh floor -- but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again. You dig?
But this is the key to the executive washroom.
Now hold on, Baxter --
Look, you can't stay here. Just take your champagne and go.
I did, didn't I? I distinctly remember bending over and putting it there --
Yeah.  Some clown at Schrafft's 57th Street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick.
I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
Something like that.
She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she didn't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- believe me, Doc, I'm not thinking about myself --
Yeah, wasn't I?
That so.
All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
'Twas the night before Christmas And all through the house Not a creature was stirring -- Nothing -- No action -- Dullsville!  You married?
No.
Good night?
Who?
I see.  What do you think, Al? Can we help the man?
Doctor.
So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
Still afraid somebody may see us together?
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
Six weeks. But who's counting?
I missed you, Fran.
Like old times. Same booth, same song --
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --
Where are we going, Jeff? Not back to that leaky boat --
Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.
And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --
Yeah, we better.
Are you there, Fran?
What are you talking about?
What's your mother doing this afternoon?
But I thought you could hold your tongue.
Dreadful.
Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat.
I like all of them --
We need all our fuel anyway.
You're out of your skull --
Moonby. Got any Winstons?
No.
What unit were you with ?
None.
Rangers, eh?
Yeah.
Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.
Holy shit.
That's right, sir -- I come from New Orleans -- I was raised to be a sauciere.. a great sauciere. We specialize in sauces; my whole family. It's what we do. I was supposed to go to Paris and study at the Escoffier School; I was saving the money. They called me for my physical so I figured the Navy had better food.
Chef -- since you're such a fan of Miss December's I think you should be detailed with Lance and Clean to take the first drum up there.
What do you see?
Probably is.
Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise.
We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ?
'Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down.
Smoke !
Rocks, sand -- those two men who deserted.
Signs?
Listen.
One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant.
You didn't like him.
Yeah, it still runs.
About what ?
I don't know. He was a lame, that's all.
But why ?
Two of my men deserted last night. It happens from time to time. I assume my daughter told you of our conditions.
It's hairy ,though. That's where we lost McDonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. It's Charlie's point.
I got bored in Saigon.
Can you trust them?
'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive?
Fucking savages.
It's gonna blow this place out. It's gonna ruin it ...
Colonel Kurtz, I guess.
Still playing by the rules.  You're a damn good kiler.
Pain is easy to handle -- but nobility.. the nobility of a man is judged by how much Truth he can handle.
Gimme water.
No water.
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
You get to know each other pretty well out there.
And you admired him?
No -- no, Captain.
Which one's the Colonel's?
This boat's a mess.
But lemme tell you, he is the most dangerous thing in every way that I've come on so far. He wanted to shoot me. The first thing he said is, 'I'm going to shoot you because you are a deserter.' I said I didn't desert from your army, I deserted from my army. He said, 'I'm going to shoot you just the same.'
Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels...
That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz.
20   CONTINUED:  
You talk about ecology -- there it is.
...I won't let a killer walk!
How long have you been up north?
You should know something.
Have you talked to Eric?
What happened here?
Why?
He's coming around fine.
I'll go into town with you.
-- Permanently?
Let's go.
Where's Corbett?
Please, Anne Marie, you being here only complicates things.
When you ran off, I thought you'd keep going 'til you were back home in Washington.
Nice bluff the other day with the tranquilizer gun out your jeep window.  See you again, maybe.
I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.
Still quite a hike to Devil's Cauldron.  Days.  A long stretch to go without sleep, my friend.  You can hide behind that pistol for now, but take your eyes off me long enough to sneeze --
Be my guest.
Most dangerous thing in the world: A regular Joe, in over his head.  You trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself?
Let's camp.  There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.
Forget it.  It would take days.
Sure love to know where you fit in up here.
I'm here to do my job.
They think you're in Fairbanks. If not, they still won't find you before the plane comes tomorrow.
I'll get loose before that plane comes.
You don't care enough about Sam to --
Sit your suspect out in the cold. He'll keep.
Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little...  You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.
Don't be silly. How bad?
He's good...  And I'm an expert on doctors.
Since forever.
Only in the emergency room or when he was well.
I've got Jews at my table.
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
He's gotta fight to breathe. His asthma can just shoot off the charts -- he's allergic to dust and this is New York and his immune system bails on him when there's trouble so an ear infection...  Is this bothering you?
So what are you doing with a dog?
Yeah, yeah...  any chance you'll get back to work today?
Uh, Udall?
He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.
So. Anything else?
Hey, what I did for you is working out?
You take off when you have to.
Is there another way to see it?
Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
Thanks, Melvin.
No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one?
My son was outside playing soccer. I never saw him playing ball. Come on, you guys -- take me out for a good time... Take me out dancing.
Stop asking everyone.
I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
And?
Fries.
If you ask me... I'll say, "yes."
I'll never forget you said it.
Sorry, didn't realize she was right there.  Did you have sex with her?
Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
This one has a special meaning.
Hello.
Yeah... Well...
What job?
Hey, I've got a great compliment for you.
Yes. I really would.
Well...
Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
She's nice.
What?
If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey there!  Have you seen Verdell?
It smells like shit in here?
Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.
Come on, sweetheart...
I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out.  Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life.
What are you doing?
Sit back.  Put your seatbelt on.
Boy, that's fucking genius.  You're a fucking genius.  Then you're just sitting there, bullshitting with me. Man, no way I coulda done that!
Robert Bain, driving me!  Jesus fucking Christ!
Okay.
Listen to me, Bain.  Two days ago, you contacted your contractor, who told you that they knew when and where I was going to pick up the transferred money from MicroCell. You don't know how they got the information.  It bothered you, but you didn't care.  How do I know this?  Because ten years ago, I was sitting in that chair, as scared shitless as you are now.
How in the fuck do you know that?
Who is that other guy?
This is something that is never going to end.  You can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. To survive, you have to go into deep hiding.  And that's going to take money, a lot of money.
Why?
Just Electra?
What do you want to know?
Why?
Had?
He was... taken.
Where you wanted to be?
Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.
About?
No.
No.
You should knock.
Okay.  Then what?
That means you won't have a gun.
We split the money?
It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear.  Things happened beyond my control.  I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.
What happened?
I went into their room this afternoon.
Nobody ever sees me.
Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
Who was she?
Four minutes.
I prefer it like this.
That's okay, hon, I always expect the unexpected.
All the time.
That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
Right.
When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay.  I feel good.
I used to think about it.  I had Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe.  I could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but I couldn't see that next part.  'Then what?' So I'd stop thinking about it and go back to work.  You understand?
How would you like the funds?
American currency.
Well, he sure seems fired up all of a sudden.
Inspirations a fickle thing, you don't realise you had it till it's gone.
We're only joking.....It is your round though!
Oh yeah, what's that?
Like Custer huh?
Okay, we're listening. But I'm with Katka on this one.
I feel like a mole in this joint, so I guess I might as well come out lookin' like one!
Later Mate, right now I've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time.
Wow!....What have you been doing, rolling around in it?
Yeah, that was Honza's idea, I had to buy him a few beers in return for the gear.
I'm an idiot?
Really, "The Freeman Centre"?
Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
Need any disks?
I had a better idea, we'll burn them. There's a drum across the road; I was just waiting for the workers to go home.
Nope.
Just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better.
It looks new, they might miss one or two.
Let's split.
No, We aren't going to do it.
Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
It just happened.
It's me you want, I'm responsible for all this.
Your too good for this town, Buddy.
So I hear.
I had a visit from the British Embassy. They think I'm a stray soccer hooligan.
I stopped by your office. Henry was steaming, he says he's going to throw you out of the window and that you never worked at the Bugler.
Lucky break!
What happened to those disks I gave you, have you still got them?
And if you're wrong.
Yeah, Dave Walters.
42 56 76......... Okay, you wait at Dave's for my call tomorrow, if you don't hear from me by three o'clock, send that note and get out of the country fast.
Do you know the way?
Jesus Holly, we got enough time.
No!
I've been around.
No! Look Lawrence, I've taken over the lease on a theatre downtown and I'm throwing a party tomorrow night to show it off. It's going to be for alternative arts, but I need some help to finish it off, can you put the word out?
We should be done by the weekend.
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.
You used to read.
I'll get the drinks, but not here. Let's split. I can't stand this any more, it's murdering my respect for literature.
What?
Don't give me this Kat, I'm doing it for you and your country.
Everybody is at home, it's no good.
I could have my choice of many boyfriends and go to movies and discos but I waste my time waiting for you and then going to stupid pubs.
It's not so much.
Yeah, it's a simple piece. If they get the floor done in time, me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon, but it's not critical.
It is okay........We will paint the wood black, yes?
Yes, of course...maybe one hour.
How?
I got a bad feeling about this.... How much do you need?
I don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good friend of the Judge.
I'll put one on the notice-board too.
Shall I wash these out?
What would you like, beer?
Who you saving the dishes for?
Don't you have a girlfriend?
You have the letter and my word, if you wish you may wait upstairs....Now, where are the disks?
Central station, locker number 139 - combination JFK.
Hey Doug, where you been?
No, just a drill.
But I have to finish this....
So, he didn't fire you?
I think we should be going honey.
You bastard!
It was crazy not to have destroyed them
And there has been enquiries from the American Embassy maybe they are involved?
Were you with Jamie?
I meant he's a doctor.
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
What are you doing here?
She's like some Puritan.
You're like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere --
-- Your act only works with an audience.
Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
No problem --
I'll get something for us to drink --
Do you believe you'll see your mother again?
Like in a church painting. I see this giant hovering over the ground. He's wearing a robe, and has long flowing hair, and he's pointing his finger at something.
Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
You have to believe to have faith.
The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
You're not in a very good mood.
Or anywhere where people might see us.
Belinda's a very jealous person.
It's a start.
Before we do this.
It's about working with what you already have -- right now -- at your fingertips -- you know, spontaneously.
You're acting like a crazy person.
You're sometimes not sure?
I don't understand...
Assholes. This happen to you?
How do you know this place?
From here he proved to me the earth isn't flat.  On rainy days, we'd be above the clouds.
What about your father?
Care, but just don't let it get to you. It gives them power.
One of your secrets.
Nope.
Lower. Same page.
Can I -- go out?
That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you.
Apropos of nothing... so. So so so so --
No.
Materially or spiritually?
Yes. You?
Yes.
Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter?
Please.
Finally, I'd like you to join the drama club. Rehearsals are Tuesday and Thursday evenings.
No way. No thanks. I can't do it --
What do you want, Biff?
I beg your pardon?
Morning Dick.
Fine.
But he didn't ask me.
The sunrise? What for?
Oh, no! That was for the cafeteria! This is different!
It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
Your line, George!
You know damn well that's not what I meant.
You have a name?
You're the only Mr. Lewis in this class.  If you have something to say, say it so the whole class can hear.
What?!
Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.
He will be. Simple inebriation, is all. The young man must have a rather low tolerance for alcohol... something that runs in the family. You see, he's a second cousin of mine on my mother's side. Came quite a distance to visit me, he added. His name's Lewis.
On second thought, there may be some things you'll have to tell me.
Professor. Well, not exactly, Professor. You see, we don't point it at the sun.
Then I would have figured out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history! Don't you understand? The fabric of history is very delicate. Anything you do could have serious consequences!
Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?
Let me put it on a level you can understand. You don't belong here. You don't know anything about this world. You don't know the customs, you don't know how to talk, how to act -- you don't even look like you belong here. And if you walked out on the street, you wouldn't get 100 yards without being arrested. Then there would be questions, and where would we come up with the answers?
I am serious. If we could get you, the time machine, and the power converter in the vicinity of an atomic blast, we could send you back to the future.
Say, where did this guitar come from?
Well, it was there.
That's all taken care of.
There's no way of knowing.
Nope. My father's never clenched a fist in his entire life!
But if you didn't rebuild the time machine, how did I go back in time in the first place?
Pretty, isn't it?
I run this place! 
...He just lets himself get pushed around all the time! People walk all over him and he never fights back, never stands up for himself.
Yeah.
Kit... Maybe I'd better get a shovel.
Oh yeah?
Say, what kind of rifle was that you were shooting at me?
Listen. I got a lot of respect for her, sir.  That's about as good a one as I know to tell you.
Hi.
What for?
Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage.
You're a redhead.
Gosh, what was everybody talking about?
You know what I think?
What?
You tired?
I'd like to get out of here.
Why not? I mean, I'm having fun... At least I'm not bitching.
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
Morning... Say, you got any gas?
Who are you?
There's another one we owe 'em.
Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo escaped...
Planet 10?
Dr. Lizardo's a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy, a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours.
The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before Buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  His hair was orange...
That's me. I've been ionized, but I'm okay. I'm, switching on the homing beacon, mark two minute intervals.
Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?
Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy?  The invisible body?
And there's a two-hundred-dollar deductible we have to eat on that crack in her windshield.
And they got Penny!  Look!
Got a casualty list?
This song's for Peggy.  And all you others out there a little down on your luck.
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
Oh, my.
Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.
It's too dangerous.
World Watch One.  Direct incoming transmission.
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
Why me?
What?! He's a son of a bitch!
What are they like? What are they about?
You wrote his scripts for him?
Before what?
So now I'm s'posed to roll over like an ol' bitch dog gettin' ger belly scratched.
I write.
No, I – I didn't mean to sound –
What DID you mean?
...No. I never saw him with anyone else.
Look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent – don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift? Shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?
Goddamn voices... DROWN 'EM!
Think about it, Fink. Writers come and go; we always need Indians.
I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're producing this Wallace Beery picture I'm working on.
Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's taken an interest! What the hell did you say to him?
...What is it Barton? Are you okay?
Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell, all the carryings-on next door.
That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work –
That's okay; actually I am just starting out in the movies – though I was pretty well established in New York, some renown there,
Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
You're all right, Charlie. I'm glad you stopped by. I'm sorry if – well I know I sometimes run on.
My folks live in Brooklyn, with my uncle.
Nope, never watched any. I'm not that interested in the act itself –
...You're a little out of your weight class, but just for purposes of demonstration –
...All right now, when I say "Ready... wrestle!"  you try and pin me, and I try and pin you. That's the whole game. Got it?
I hope these are your shoes.
You're leaving?
No... Can I come in?
...Will you stay with me till they get here?
Hold on –
Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
Jesus, Charlie, I...
Sure, Charlie.
...Don't look at me like that, neighbor.  It's just me – Charlie.
But Charlie – why me? Why –
...Yes, thank you.
I – Mr. Lipnik –
You don't have to cover for him. It's noble of you, but these things happen in business.
Actually it hasn't officially gone through yet. Had wardrobe whip this up. You gotta pull teeth to get anything done in this town. I can understand a little red tape in peacetime, but now it's all-out warfare against the Japs. Little yellow bastards.  They'd love to see me sit this one out.
Welcome to the Hotel Earle. May I help you, sir?
Rez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a week payable in advance. Checkout time is twelve sharp, only you can forget that on account you're a rez. If you need anything, anything at all, you dial zero on your personal in-room telephone and talk to me. My name is Chet.
His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
Also known as Madman Mundt.
Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.
Good luck with no fuckin' head.
...Thanks Lou. Join us. Join us. Talking about the Wallace Beery picture.
Yes, Colonel.
Home. Watching TV.
It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
Yes.
Sometimes I really hate you.
She told you, didn't she?
She's really sick you know.  Don't you know what she's doing?  She knows I went to Berkeley.  She knows I knew Noah.  She makes up that story about me.  She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her.
How long were you having sex with him?
Yes.
Do you always keep old newspapers around?
But you said you liked men to use their hands.
Writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him.
Sure.
I'm tired.
You know all about me.
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
Am I... disturbing you?
It was an accident.  They got in the line of fire.
I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.
I like you.
What if I asked you not to call me Shooter?
There's Pepsi in the fridge.
Why take the risk?
How's your new book?
Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?
Do you believe me?
I found Lisa Henderson.
I'm very good at research.  I'll help you.
How did it end?
He was murdered.
What was the weapon?
.38 revolver.  Never recovered.
Who was this fuckin' guy?
Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.
Ain't that cute?  They got his and her Pig-assos, son.
I'm not gonna get AIDS, pop --don't worry about it.  I always use a rubber.
In that little pissant car of yours? Hell, no.  I ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- I'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate Seiko watch.
Don't you get it, Gus?  If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley.  It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.
How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
She'd have to be nuttier than a twenty-pound Christmas fruitcake. She's not the one who hangs out with multiple murderers -- your girlfriend is.
Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna let this slide.  What about her parents?  What about what else she's published?  At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.
Fuck you, Phil.
Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house.  All we did was write her name down.
She's got enough money to burn this whole department down.
Can there be some mistake?
Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors – anything with a SAMO tag on it.  The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?"
Ouch..
Do you think I could borrow your limousine? I'll get it back to you in an hour.
Hmmm. And 'Parasites.'  You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.
We don't hang them at home, y'know – just in the streets..
Who am I?
You got a date already?
Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate.
So then what?
Good.
Good. What do you have?
What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.
That's not how I meant it.  For all you know, you might just be a flash in the pan! You can never tell.
Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?
I really... admire you.
See you later.
No, I'd like the scarf.
No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get.
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
So shut up and keep painting..
'Phillips head,' right?
I need this?
Uh-oh!
Mr. Wayne ... a reminder:  Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck.  May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
Once you were their freak, now these clowns do your bidding. Must feel pretty good.
What're you really after?
Well, I could ... free up some time...
The news these days ... weird. People looking to superheroes for their peace of mind, and blaming their problems on super-villains ... instead of themselves, or their spouses at least.
And it's not even accurate ... I mean, "Batman Blows It"?  The guy probably prevented <u>millions</u> in property damage.
What went wrong?  Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her.
Nope, I told her everything.
And the truth frightened her?
It's the so-called "normal" guys who always let you down.  Sickos never scare me.  At least they're commited.
Now don't give me a killing-Max- won't-solve-anything speech, because it will.  Aren't you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron always coming out on top?  When he should be six feet under?
Hmm.  Primitive ventilation.
No.  No glass on the inside.
It does to me.
Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.
Let's consummate our fiendish union!
But who could've ... no, don't say it.
Okay, go ahead.  Intimidate me, bully me if it makes you feel big.  I mean, it's not like you can just kill me.
How long has it been, Uncle Alfred?
Too late for what, dear child?
Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
Congratulations on your apprehension of Mr. Freeze.  Batman monopolized the evening news.
Attending to heroes?  No sir.  My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
Alfred, old friend, I could use your help right now.
Pamela Isley.  I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly.  I still can't.  She used to work for Wayne Enterprises.  Find a file.
What is it?
Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
This is to replace the bike I lost. I'll get you the rest.
What are you talking about?
I'm afraid to ask.
What exactly are you doing?
The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
I was just hanging around.
I thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs.
Watch the first step.
I know.  The feeling just vanished.
Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.
She knows who we are.
We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat.  No coolants to preserve food.  Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
Umm.  What I mean is...no plans at the moment...
I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
Impressive
There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.
I find that unlikely.
Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
What do we have here?  A lovely new supply of Venom.  I'll just take this to my laboratory for further study.
The dreams again, sir?
She has an excellent mind.
...The night Batman was born.  What was I doing in the fields that night, Alfred? What sent me running out into that storm? I keep dreaming about it but I just can't remember.
Why, indeed?
Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
...A bat.
Letters in the alphabet.
Up here, Al.
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.
What's wrong?
You are direct, aren't you?
I haven't had much luck with women...
I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I?
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
To kill me.
That's usually my line.
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
Listen, Dick. Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away. It'll make it worse.
I need to be part of this.
Absolutely not.
...I missed Two-Face by a heartbeat. When we catch him, you gotta let me kill him!
Not until you do that thing I like.  On se tue pour des mesnonges. J'ai gache ma vie...  Woah. Harsh toke.
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
Mr. Wayne is out for the day.
I loathe bats.
What is that?
Great.  Give me a grant.
What is it you want?
Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even --
I know it's late. I -- Are you there?
Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process.
Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself.
It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --
All this apparatus, Vicki... This house, and the money, and the power ... It was never mine. It was something I inherited. Bruce Wayne was something I inherited.  All I ever hoped for was someone who could see through Bruce -- who could see me -- and not be frightened.
He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment.
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --
Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.
I answer to Grissom, punk.  Not to you.
I dunno, man.  After what happened to Johnny Gobs - -
Gimme a break, will you?  Shut up.
Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
... Thank you.
And you want a --
I've seen worse.  Much worse.
Rich.  Reclusive.  Bankrolls half a dozen charities.
Are they paying you for all this?
Alexander... I know you.
Ahm, well, you know ~ that's a tough question - on one' level I think it ....
Scottish.
Go ahead.
Liar.
Shut up, Kevin.  Honey, you-re not making sense ...
Two dollars please.
Seems to be a problem with the door. Where's the picture gone?
It wasn't a dream, was it.  I have to go in to work and tell them Whistler's Mother now looks like Danny De Vito.
Yes, isn't he.
Look, I've left Bean on his own. Nice to chat though Bernie - always a subtle joy.
Okay, that'll do.  The Governor's here in half an hour.  We have to be totally ready then.  No excuses.  Period!
I beg your pardon?
Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er ...
The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift.
Bravo.  Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?  Don't want anything to go wrong.
Maybe two cars.
All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan Day- Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish.  Even Anthony Hopkins is welsh.  Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors.
She was wearing a helmet.  It could have been worse.
Why thank you sir.
Shut up, Kevin.
I wish I could use that at school.  "Hey, Teach, no hard feelings ... It's just things between us ain't what they used to be and I need a little space, ya know?  So I'11 see you around in a couple of years, maybe".
Huh huh huh. He said "anus."
Beavis. This is what it's all about.
Huh huh huh. That chick was talking about doing it.
Me first!
Damn, huh huh.
Beavis, huh huh, what'er you doing?
That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows about fire! Change the channel.
Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.
Uh...
Hey Butt-Head, are we gonna die?
Hey Butt-Head, I'm starting to feel weird. I think I'm freaking out.
Yeah, heh heh. Umm, isn't Seattle in Washington? Heh heh... 'cuz I was thinking maybe we could go see Hole.
Well where is she?!
Heh heh. Fire. Heh heh Aaaaeeehhhhg!!!
You hear that, Beavis! We're gonna get alcohol, tobacco and guns!
Butt-dumpling...
Beavis.
Just make sure it looks like an accident...
Yeah, we're gonna score.
Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in Las Vegas?
Yeah, heh heh. I'm gonna have money, and a big-screen TV and sluts everywhere!
They perk me right up.
Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
Does that say Xanax?
We got nothing, Chief. We tore the place apart. We can only legally hold her for another couple of hours.
Cut the power!
Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
What the hell...? Bork! That bus we picked up. Where was it headin'?
Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...
Not on him, Chief.
Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
Ah'm gonna blow you both to hell!
Who sent ya?
Uh, ten uh...
Manchurian Tung oil?  Where did you get it?
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
Adam, your Bozman Building is a beauty.
Yeah it turned out okay.  We applied for a National Historical plaque for it.  That'll be the third one on Main Street.
How's your arm?
I don't think we survived the crash.
Maybe this is heaven.
Won't?  Or can't?
Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.
That little girl saw us.
... Not what I expected when we walked through that door.
God, this is so corny.  Have we been reduced to this?  Sheets?
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
I guess we open it.
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
What time is it?
You can actually see us?  Without the sheets?
We want to frighten you away.  So that you'll move out.
We studied all day yesterday. Don't tell me...
Hell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a businessman.  I'm the man what <u>am</u>. <u>Beee</u>tel <u>Jooose</u>!  <u>Who</u> do I gotta kill?
No.
If... we have trouble.  What about the guy in the flyer?  Betelge...
What do you mean?  What's he do?
The whorehouse was my idea. I want Betelgeuse out of the picture!  We've got some serious talking to do.
We can't.  We haven't left the house since the funeral.
I don't wear that stuff to <u>bed</u>. Besides, there's <u>nothing</u> wrong with it.  I'm getting out of here.
Hi, Barb!  I'm glad I caught you. I heard you were on vacation!
You could double the size of your hardware store!  You'll be rich.
I am <u>not</u>!  Beetle... Juice?
That's it!
God, you're anatomically correct!
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
... sheets.
The attic room is locked --
I don't care from guilt.  I just want to <u>see</u> them.
Any particular kind?
I think the reason is they were trying to scare you, and you didn't get scared --
Lydia, I will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors.  You help us with these ghosts or you'll be sorry.
You read my <u>mind</u>!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
'I' will tell you what is boring.  Once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- only perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place <u>might</u> just be livable.  What's on the third floor?
Oh, Delia, lighten up!
Look at that <u>detail</u>!
What's happening to them?
All presences have a home space. A place where they live, so to speak.  Where do they hide out?
I understand. I've seen it done before.
However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
... Straight out?
It's fine today, Robert.
Yes. I love Eve very much.
Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out here.
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.
He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?
Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.
A Black man gave me the message.
Oh, Mr. Gardiner, I've been looking all over.
I hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you.
I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
... Why... No, I don't think so...
Forgive me, Chauncey - I didn't mean to pry. You must have been very close to him.
Oh, no. She brought me my meals.
I'll be all right, Chauncey you go ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...
Hello, Eve.
Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.
Hello, Mr. Gardiner. This is Sid Courtney, Washington Post.
I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years?
Yes, very well, thank you.
... Are you sure you like it?
Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.
Yes, it is very good!
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner - we're prisoners of tubes and technology.
... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.
I understand.
Yes. I would like to escort Eve.
A flower...
I want to tell Eve.
Hello, Ronald.
I can't read.
Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
... Then you really are a gardener?
Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance?
It's starting to swell, is it painful?
I've never ridden in an automobile.
Yes.
Mr. Gardiner, how very nice to have you with us this evening.
No. I don't object.
Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
... We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts, the law firm handling the estate.
... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment?
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
I see...
Do you have any proof of your employment, Mr. Chance - any checks from the deceased, any contracts or documents?
Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's just fine with me - I'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion... Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner...
Yes, I will.
That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
... Gardiner is laconic, matter-of fact. The scuttlebutt is that he's a strong candidate for one of the vacant seats on the board of First American. But before we can do any sort of a piece on the man, we're going to need facts on his background...  ... Kinney, what did you come up with?
I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you.
... How are the kids getting along?
I really don't know, Tom - he seems so honest and simple... In a way, he's quite charming...
Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's a damn fine attorney! I've got to talk to her about this Gardiner...
We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.
Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent.
Good. Anything else?
... Well?
You take care too, Bobby.
Morning.
What?
Is the trial date set?
We have to make it an early night.
I'll meet you on the turnpike.
Why aren't you at work?
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
Fuck Maxine.
What's that?
Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole.
I need a shower.
I suppose. But they got here first, the lousy bastards. So now it's all over, I guess.
Holy shit! He said what I said!
I said "yes."
Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.
No.
I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you?
I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz.
Ah. yes, the little door.  There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you'll just make it.
Why not?
Who told you?
That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops!
Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!
You married?
I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.
No, wait! I like your tits.  I love your tits. I want to fuck you.
You wanted to be partners with me?
Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.
Are you torturing me on purpose?
I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
You can be John Malkovich.
Two hundred dollars, please.
And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.
Impressions? Those are hard.
Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I saw him do "Tru" with his sixty foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.
I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
But of course.
Count me in.
Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
Yes?
I love you, Lotte.
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.
How do we do that?
No.
How'd you get this number?
Do you mind?
Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
Shut up!  Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.
Bad dream, darling?
But you said...you said out there, there ain't no...what was that word?..no..de- fense. No de-fense.
Folks came.
If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.
The Word. What you was put here to speak.
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
You saying nothing counts?
YOU HURT ME.
Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
Well, is it now? How you getting along?
She gone like they say?
I don't. I have my own.
I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.
Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
I'm looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some.
I miss her.
Could be that fall you took.
Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
Mama...Mama she's asleep. Why don't you eat something.
I know what I see.
What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?
Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too.
You planning to do anything about it?
Leave off..
Hey!!
Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
Yeah?
Her life is in your hands.
Shit.
Visiting friends of hers in Palm Springs.  Just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us.
Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive.
Hey, man, I'm not--
Yes, so we were informed.  However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle.
His name is Lebowski?  That's your name, Dude!
Yeah.
Where you going, Dude?
What tied the room together, Dude?
What's a pederast, Walter?
Life does not stop and start at your convenience, you miserable piece of shit.
I am the Walrus.
Burkhalter.
Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
What have you.  We'll, uh--
--So he says, "My son can't hold a job, my daughter's married to a fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown. But you know me.  I can't complain."
Hey, is this him with Nancy?
Lebowski on the right?
These are Mr. Lebowski's children, so to speak--
They're not his, heh-heh, they're not literally his children; they're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner-city children of promise but without the--
Heh-heh--
Ahh, not so good, man.
Far from it.
Howdy do, Dude.
Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things been goin'?
I wouldn't know, Dude.  I deal in publishing, entertainment, political advocacy, and--
Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off manually.
Of course you do.  I can see you're anxious for me to get to the point. Well Dude, here it is.  Where's Bunny?
Me?  How would I know?  The only reason she ran off was to get away from her rather sizable debt to me.
Of course, there's that to discuss. Refill?
Is that what that's a picture of?
Yes, I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
You mean coitus?
A hundred.
Now I got--
And then. . . let's see, I uh--music business briefly.
But he's--
Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--
Walter, this is not a guy who built the rail- roads, here, this is a guy who peed on my--
So who--
Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?
Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it is no dream.
Huh?
Come on Walter, it's just--it's Smokey.  So his toe slipped over a little, it's just a game.
What the fuck is going on there?
Ya see?  Nothing is fucked up here, Dude.  Nothing is fucked.  These guys are fucking amateurs--
Wooden bridge, huh?
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?  What the fuck're we gonna tell Lebowski?
No, Walter!  I said I thought she kidnapped herself!  You're the one who's so fucking certain--
That's it.  I'm out of here.
The nail polish, Walter.
That makes me feel all warm inside.
Yeah.
What're you, a fucking park ranger now?
He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--
Not exactly a lightweight.
And yet his son is a fucking dunce.
Is this your homework, Larry?
What's your point, Dude?
Okay, but how does all this add up to an emergency?
Huh?
Uh-huh.
What's mine is mine.
Then what's...
Well can we--
Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla usted Inglese?  I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?
Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam anybody here, I'm just--
Look, let me explain something. I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's what  you  call me.  That, or Duder. His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing--
Are you employed, sir?
You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.
Huh?
'Scuse me?
Well we--I don't--
Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy wife, I mean, in the parlance of our times, owes money all over town, including to known pornographers-- and that's cool, that's cool-- but I'm saying, she needs money, and of course they're gonna say they didn't get it 'cause she wants more, man, she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean-- hasn't that ever occurred to you...? Sir?
We know the briefcase was empty, man.  We know you kept the million bucks yourself.
You monsters!
Walter--
You happy, you crazy fuck?
Impressive.
What about Nomak?
how long since he was bitten?
No hemoglobin left. Their metabolisms are too fast.  They burn out.  That's why they're having to feed so often.  Their systems are self destructing.
Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're all dead.
Where were you, Whistler?
Your security's for shit, kid.
It has been said, you may have enemies whom you hate, but not enemies whom you despise.  Be proud of your enemy: then his success shall be yours, too.  In that regard, I should thank you.
You want me to hunt them for you.
Tell me something, Skid --
You little shit.  When did they get to you?
Stupidity.
You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then.
How did you know?
How can you tell?
You care about him, don't you?
You don't look so good.
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
How long have we been driving?
I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise --  It's over, isn't it?
What?
How many of you are there?
You're a monster.
I was wrong about you, Blade. You were never one of us. You're a traitor to your race.
Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.
No offense, Whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed something.
And now you're using Blade to exact your revenge?
How?
What happened to the power?
Yes.
Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other.
Something was wrong.
Down or off--you're giving me a migraine.
--nothing left to play 'em on, honey.
Oh, sorry, right.
Why is there no "our" here?
--or someone--
I don't know what it is, but there is something <u>happening</u> here, and it's starting to scare the living shit out me, and look, I'm just <u>not</u> going to argue the point anymore--you want to stay here, stay, but I've got to get the fuck out of here, and I'm begging you to come <u>with</u> me.
What? That made her lose the baby?
Does it hurt?
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
--which'd be about ten bucks--
That's what Josh and Mike said.
You're not only an idiot, you're a goddamn <u>child</u>.
So where the hell am I going to sleep?
Yeah?
Too busy eating us?
Mi casa y su casa!
English.
I got the tape enhanced--and I managed to sleaze a photo blow-up. Jesus, he's gonna kill me when he finds out about the camera.
--Cotter, where can I get on-line?
Boy Kurth.
Who?
What're you doing?
Okay, but--
Cotter, I think she's right. Why would those guys go to all the trouble of stealing the camera and all this other stuff and leave the tapes?
Spite.
What--
I thought all your equipment got stolen.
Why?
That's almost a year's worth of work!  Scumbags! Oh, Jesus, Jesus....
Someone want to tell me what's going on--
What'd you see?
--bullshit--
Domini's the only logical explanation.
Anna--
Could I tell him what it's regarding?
--yes--
--the Sheriff's Office--
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
I knew it. 'Cause we wouldn't have heard anything if it was him. He's real careful. Fact is, he's anal.
...But first I gotta know what happened.
We don't seem to be communicating--
See, Wednesday's the special on RC Cola. I don't know if I explained about the TV option. If there's a TV in the room, you got to pay the option.
Back where?
Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
It's taken care of. The less you know about it the better.
No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night?
Don't throw that out.
Tuesday.
Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
I've seen a few.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
The criminals are winning.
Is that why you say it's horrible?
What color is it?
Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Not yet.
Look at these. What are these?
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you. and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't it. remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
No way. get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
Nobody.
What do you want from me?
You don't?
I want you to hurt me.
Frank would open you.
Beeeee careful.
You put your disease in me. your semen. it's hot and full of disease.
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
Yeah, it's me.
Shh. I'll tell you.
No thanks. what does that mean?
Hey? . You like to walk.
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet. straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
Yes.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
How is Central these days?
What do you know about the ear?. anything?
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
Now. we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window .alright?
Alright.
I owe you. since I goofed up this one.
You didn't goof it up, but. you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday. do you have a date tonight?
Yes. I do.
I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7.
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Yeah.
Are you sure?
Who, me? Why should it?
Can I give you a kiss good night?
Jeffrey?. Why?
You want to dance?
I can't dance fast.
Dorothy! ... Dorothy!
OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone. the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
On the plane.
Let us walk.  From what I understand, Diego has bought a hundred and sixty acres, a marina, a hotel, and an airstrip.
Alright.  I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's for you.  I don't think there will be a problem.
Blanca, por favor.
What is?
You happy, baby?
You can't sell this to your friends.
Do you have any agreement or understanding whatsoever with the United States government in regards to your testimony?
Not so fast.  I would like to go over the details.
What?  Yeah, sure.
Why are you speaking?
Excuse me?
Mirtha.
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me. Cut me out, too.
I want my kid out of protective custody. Now.  No fucking around.  My wife and my kid on a plane tonight.  I sign when they call me safe and sound.
What?
Nothing.  Just a little project.
What kind of project?
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
I never believed you were a murderer.  I knew.  I knew you are a magico.  I have seen it in you.  It's in your spirit.
Good night.
Because they caught me?
I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive.
And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand.
Getting it here is no problem.  Trust me.  I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply?  How much can we get?
Perfect, George.  Perfect.  Everything is fine down here.  Everything is all set up.
Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
Who?  I need to know.  Ah, never mind. We'll talk about it later.
I'm calling it three.
There's no room.
I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
That's right.  Layaway.  Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate.
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
You loved her, didn't you?  You really loved her.
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
That was a beautiful message.
Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I?
But this is...
Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something.
Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school.
You mean, like a trip?
But I've got school.
But I have a visitor.
It's a four-man operation.  Two on the ground.  Two in the air.
You're looking at him.  We provide the plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want it to go.  You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment.  You assume all the bust risks.  We take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further.  If not, we can forget we had this conversation.
So?
This is bullshit, George.  We're never going to find anything down there.
Look around. I've put everything at your disposal. Go take a look with your own eyes.
Why are you afraid? We've always been friends. One might even say that I brought you up ... Isn't it true, Ali?
Let's suppose you were a spy. In prison, when the NLF contacts you, you pretend to support the revolution, and then the French help you to escape ...
Sure. By shooting at me.
But I haven't shot him.
You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.
Then don't complain.
It's good nobody is following us ...
That's true ... Wars aren't won with terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. Terrorism is a beginning but afterward, all the people must act ... This is the reason for the strike, and its necessity: to mobilize all Algerians, count them and measure their strength ...
Tell me ... Where is this rue de Thèbes?
Who is speaking?
Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
We'll lower a basket from the window ...
You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie.
So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
The official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.
We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
Like cats and dogs.
Sit down, Frank.
C'mon -- think about it.  If she was going to kill Marsh why leave the nasal spray bottle there for the police to find?
Aren't they all?
Objection, Your Honor.  The fact that Mrs. Crawford heard Mr. Troxell reconstruct her sentence and decided to rephrase her words in a more intelligent manner for the court doesn't mean the incident never happened.
No.
How long were you Mr Marsh's personal secretary?
Doctor Trammel, when did you first diagnose that Mr. Marsh had heart disease?
For about one year.
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
What did she do next, Mr. Roston?
And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.
And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?
No.
Then you have no way of knowing what Mr. Marsh told Miss Lawson were the reasons for his visits?
Oriental medicine.
Did you go to college, Mrs. Crawford?
Yes.
Did Mr. Marsh use drugs?
Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth.
That bastard!
I'm a practical woman Mr. Dulaney. Killing Andrew wasn't in my best interest.  As it is I'm out of a job and I'm not in his will.
In his previous will Mr. Marsh left you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars -- then he cut you out.  Why do you think he did that?
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
Hi, Joe.
You know I can't talk about that.
Yes.
Yes.
-- And then?
Because, I'm your attorney.  I shouldn't be going to your house.
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
Yeah.
It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
Really?
You lied to me!
It isn't true.  You have to believe me.
I'm glad you have such confidence in me.
Sugar or honey?
You killed him -- didn't you?
You're a monster.
Raymond, I'm the only criminal attorney you have.
But Your Honor--
Miss Braslow, I'd like to remind you that you are still under oath.
Yes.
Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white!  Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny."
We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
I don't mind waiting.
I am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what I've done!
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --!
I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that?
Grateful!?
What are you doing?
Well, I'd like to read them.
I never knew that.
Was this during Betty?
Mrs. Delaney.  Did you hear the latest?
Not this kind of heat.
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
No.
Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.
No, really?
Francesca.
Mind if I smoke?
Sure you want to keep those in the house?
No, your kids.
I doubt that.
And clean.
I better go. You sure you're all right?  It's been a pleasure. Sincerely.
Help cook?
I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.
I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.
You drink bug repellent?
What?
I never got lost. For some reason, I'm more at home everywhere than at one place. So I decided I'll think of myself as some kind of world citizen. I belong everywhere and nowhere. I'm kin to everyone, and no one in particular. See, once you get into the habit of not needing anyone, it's kind of hard to break.
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
Listen, I'm sorry I --
Oh, I'm sorry.
He's a genius. They're not photographs -- they're stories, entire histories captured in moments.
What?
How do you know what I experience?
You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony!
Yeah. It could get better.
But now that you have it -
I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
Now?!  It's after eleven.
Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice.
Think for a second. Is there someplace she said she wanted to go?
Don't feed that dog.
We can't go back there.  Are you crazy? You saw --
Your father was his best friend.  He loved Jeremiah.  So he must hate him the most of all now.  He'll take his time. But even if it is too late.  If your father is dead.  It's not over.  The door has to be closed.
Hey, watcha doing with that dog?
Hell no!
Take my advice.  And shoot that dog.  Or let me.
Yeah, in the land of the blind the one eye'd are king.
What's your problem with Crippled Dick?
Oh yeah, I guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio.
You think that's really him?
No.  Well, yeah.  Maybe just a little.
You sure got a way with women, bro.  What happened up there?
I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
What else?  Money.
Yeah, but I ain't talking horse.  I'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more.
I want you to do something for me, baby.
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
You know I can't.
All the more reason I should be here.
It's alright, baby.
Lucky thing.
Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
And you believe her?
Where are we going?  You know I hate surprises.
No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.
Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
It's...it's a bad neighborhood.  As you can see now.
That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
I'm on my way home.  Can you handle it yourself?
No, Eddie.  It's just that, I dunno.  He was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur.  All I remember is the voice.  It was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth.
Jimmy Bones?
You haven't?
Need any help with those bags, Ma'am?
Well, the bad news is we only made 25 bucks each.
How could that be?  The box was packed!
Evidence of what?
Glenlivet, right, Gino?
Come on, Pop, all I want to know is one thing.  Just one thing after he made such a big deal out of it.  I bet it wasn't a big deal.  Was it, Caesar?
The next one blows off your dick.
Caesar?  What is this?
Gimme the gun.
So, you just got out?
Caesar, what happened?
It was him.  I'm positive.
I hate that little fuck!  I hate him!  I hate him!  I should've done him!
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
The hell I can't!
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
I saved you.
We were in a car accident --
I should have let him kill you.
Another time.
Where is it?
No.
Now why don't you go watch some TV or something?
Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem.  They haven't shown up yet.
This is a beautiful place.
So this is temporary for you?
My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here.  I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?
You're doing everything yourself?
Truck.  Of course.
'63 Chevy.
Okay, one drink.
You seem uncomfortable.  Do I make you nervous, Corky?
Are you surprised that I know what it is?
Isn't it obvious?  I'm trying to seduce you.
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
How did you meet him?
All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex.  Not real sex. But they're wrong.  I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.
Fuck it!  I think you better leave.
Sounds like he wanted to get caught.
That's why I need your help.  You said you were good.
The difference is, I can have sex with someone I just met, someone I hardly know, but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself.
Johnnie?
Gino Marzzone is coming to your apartment.  It's a big deal, isn't it?  That means Caesar will be ready. He doesn't want to look like an idiot. Gino has been there before?
Does Johnnie hit on you?
Gino travels with a big man named Roy.  Caesar calls him the driver.
An accident.
I'm just asking, what if?
I won't.
That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
No, Johnnie.  No goddamned phones. Not now.
Pop?
No.  We can't risk it.
Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge.  This is it.  He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
What do you want to do?
They're right about you, aren't they?  You're fried.  You really don't know what's going on, do you?
So now you know.
We'll make you better.  We can put the pieces back.  We can do that.
<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
Keep it. 
Did you bring investment advice for me tonight?  It was tax shelters, wasn't it?  Swiss debenture-swaps.
I don't know.
Yes.  Is he there?
...I understand...
Look, our bid -- it was competitive -- but definitely at the high end of competitive -- when we didn't hear back from you, we did some re-analysis of the numbers, and honestly, we'd really like a chance to do a bit better.  I'm assuming you're still in the market.  It's the same vessel?
I want to go home.
You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.
I won't hurt you.
When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
Nothing.  It's just not there.
Well, this is great.  I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
I don't remember any of this.
-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>.
What does that mean?  Jason, what does that mean?  Jason, please...who is he?
It doesn't matter who you were before.  It's who you want to be. That's all that matters.  We have this money.  We have what we have.  I had nothing before and now, I don't know, maybe I have more, maybe it's nothing, but...  I say we leave here.  We leave this place.  We go until we can't go anymore.
You could do that?
xxxxxx
And that's it?
What about you?
-- slow down -- you can't just take the book like that --
What the hell're you talking about?
-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --
How did I get here?
...ixed itself.
...ven't you?
What? How do you know my name?
It's reply paid.
Layton.
Deputy minister, what do you believe is behind this recent increase in terrorist bombings?
In fact, killing people -
Sam, what are we going to do with you? Can you hear me, Sam?
I assure you, Sam, I'm doing everything within my power. But the rules of the game are laid down, and we all have to play by them - even me.
Dr. Jaffe has pinned her ears back.
Sorry about that ... Mr Helpmann told me you were coming aboard - congratulations!
Am I?
I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him, on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done.
Er ... but I would've found out anyway.
And you're mine.
There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
Tell that to the wives of the Security men she blew up this afternoon. Listen, we've also had a report just in from Central Services that Tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent Central Services systems - as a matter of fact, in your block. I'd keep my eyes open if I were you, Sam. Bye.
You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
How could you do this to me?
I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.
Oh.
Don't look back! Act naturally!
What are you doing? For Christ's sake! Get moving!
... This is amazing ... for me ... being here with you. I mean, in my dreams you ...
Yes, of course. Sorry.
I know you. I saw you through the floor, didn't I?
It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
Well, terrorists of course.
You're joking.
I thought you arrested me.
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
That's it.
I've go to accept that promotion to get behind this, haven't I?
What! Shit!
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
You remember Samuel, my son.
Is Mr Helpmann here?
Sam!!! 
Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets go of the parcel and pushes JILL away. She moves off.
Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer
And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?
I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.
What is it?
What?
Nice and easy now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
Thank you very much. How much will it...?
Es impossible.
In that time, you ever have sex?
That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these.
Does that hurt?
I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
Okay, what happened?
What's his name?
I wouldn't do that.  The doctor seems to think he's suffering from some rare disorder.
Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
Yes.
He's better, isn't he?
I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.
He wants to pull that tube out. It's pretty painful--that's why they keep him sedated--but it's a good sign.
It's best not to ...  It's good pizza, huh?
How long you been doing this?
Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.
I heard CY Coates was brought in. He looked pretty bad.
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon.
Look at that. A fat junkie. That's a first.
That's too many.
Backup?
Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
I'll drink to that.
What do you think?
How many times have you shocked him tonight?
Last show of the night.
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.
It's not worth it, Tom. He's surrendering.
Get ready, Frank. Missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. There's gonna be trauma tonight!
What do you want to break?
Look at that. Tell me that's a crazy person. Every move is calculated. He knows exactly what he's doing. This is the guy. I've been after him for weeks. He's quick, runs like a rat, tough for one person, but with two of us--
That's ridiculous.
Oh no!--I just remembered.
Stomach again.
Shit, shit, shit...
How <u>you</u> doing?
Shut up a second...
Never to pretend to know more than I did.
Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of the Cabinet.
This is uncomfortable for me -- because, well, I don't mean it as a knock, but we approach this differently.
What?
You were smokin' toward the end there.
London.
Yes.
Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
Of course.
Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little before 11:00, drop by the studio.
<u>If</u>...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll wait for you at my apartment.
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about.
Don't say anything about anything.
Really?
It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
I've got to tell Ernie...because there isn't enough time.
He said something about...
What?
Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating being a news source.
I broke up with my roommate -- He was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything.
How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll be fine.  Stay here with me -- we'll go for a drive, have some drinks, make happy plans.
No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
Jane -- For God's sake...  Look, it's time for you to go to sleep.
You know, Tom, I feel a little proud when people comment on your looks.  Maybe you should feel that way.
Hi.
I kept thinking what a great break it was for me to get to see you tonight.  More than a great break, maybe just what I needed...just when I needed it...Angel of mercy -- godsend...lifesaver...what?
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.  I have it cold, confirmed.  They have five million dollars in this thing already.
Billion.
You okay?
Nervous?
You have to celebrate with me, don't you?  Everybody's going to that bar on the corner, 'Caps.'
Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you.
Uh-huh.
I forgot all about Aaron.  I promised to stop by and see how he did.
Uh-huh.
Yes.
That's yes?
I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's verboten, huh?  I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you.  That's not the reason you're not coming?
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
So he bought this Peugeot sedan at a greatly reduced price while he was there in charge of the White House Advance Team.
If you were an artist you could have created something!
When's the last time you had a totally nude girl in your room...
Whaddya mean?
Anything new?
Not really.  One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.
Uh, well, I'm a little nervous, I never did a person before.
These guys came by to help me try out some of my new organic recipes.
Walter!  Jeez!
Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
Walter...stay away from me!
That's word for word.
Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
Are you trying to be funny?
I know, man.
I wonder what his deal is.
I was just looking at Carla's picture.
Where'd ya buy that?
I don't have another cat!
I thought I'm not supposed to sit with the customers...
Hello Leonard!  Beautiful morning, isn't it?
No...look I'm busy...
You're like an undercover guy!
I don't think anyone gets what I said, their blank faces staring, mute, unfeeling -
Did you like it Mister Brock?
Why not?
Why on Earth should you be so depressed?  Have you heard some of the things they've been saying? You can make fifty thousand on these pieces alone!
Well, I'll go home with you.
I want you to have it.  There's a little something for you in here...
Oh, OK.
What's all the noise in here!
Don't tell me I didn't hear a racket!  I'm an older woman and I don't need to be upset and disturbed in this manner!
I don't know.  But the boy, he couldn't kill them.
Come on, come on, fork up the scub.
No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty.  Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something.
Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'.  You know, and a picture of the earth.
Are you going out with Jeffrey tonight?
I do?  I guess I do.
I can't get sick.  You know -- training and all.  I'm gonna be late.
I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.
You weren't home.  Like always.
Hi.
Do you do this kind of thing a lot? I mean, is this like a hobby?
You sure?
Thanks.
Who?
Cool.  I could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches.  What do you need?
You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
Leave me alone.
I'm glad you came.
Good thing one of us was prepared.
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
Why don't we see a movie?
To bring you... your birthright.
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
Ow.
Where's the other one?
Go to school tomorrow.  Try to act normal.  Don't let anyone know what's happening.  This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore.
Why do you keep saying that?
In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?
All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?
Here?
Put your head back.
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
Five.
How can you keep doing this?
It's what I was raised to do.  There aren't many of us left, the Watchers.
Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it...
There isn't time.
Another distraction.  It's not right.
You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
So, is Jeffrey really spending the night at your house?
I don't get it.
I don't understand.
I can't believe they still ate it.
Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
I never thought of that.
The don't.  You kind of wish they would, though.
Smell of booze much.
I really was way way too too.
Like you've got a grip.
If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
Nuke?!
He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.
He did?
It's Skip, for you.
That's great!
--Millie, you've got to stay out of the clubhouse.  It'll just get everybody in trouble.
You didn't get "lured".  Women never get lured.  They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it--"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
Well let's get down to it, honey-- how was he?
Five hours.  We both just know.  Do you think I deserve to wear white?
Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?
Damn.
Your place or mine?
Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
Who?
...  so you see in a former lifetime I'm sure that I was Alexandria, the Czarette of Russia? What do you think?
Hum, babe, hum, babe, fire it in here, hum babe--
No, no, no.  Put it back on and take it off slowly.
Jesus, what kinda broad are you?
Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman?
No, that is not belief.  That is desperation.
It was a cocksucking call!
Beg me again!
You're a cocksucker!
He did know.
You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball.  In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.
By the dozen.  Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies--  I'm through with one night stands.
I was great, eh?
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
Come over here into the light so I can kick your ass.
Nuke...tell me something.  Did you hit me with your right or your left?
What?
You will.  Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it.  Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat.  That's the secret.  You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
Crash Davis?
I'm too old for this shit.  Why the hell am I back in "A" ball?
I ain't hitting a man first.
No way.
I gotta go now, Dad.
No.  The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.
He walked eighteen?!
Ohyeah.  I shoulda throwed a slider.  Damn, Crash, how're ya?
We're eight and sixteen.
I heard he's wearing women's underwear--and he's breathing through his pingala nostril.
Crash ain't there.  He never gets back till four or five--
He goes to a whorehouse every night?
What are you talking about?
You were wandering around.
Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out?  And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license.
Excuse me.
Wait, hold on a second.
Yeah, yeah. I know that.
702 472 1862.
No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
What happened? What happened? Who did this to you?
I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose, honey, I'll -
You don't know? What time did your mother do this? When did she leave?
Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.
Ohh!
...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind of Vegas.
...the next thing I did, I started bustin' out high-stakes poker players.
I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that.
I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head?
Yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license.  You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it?
Just say so.
You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.'  That's quiet?
You lost your control.
All right.
...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!
Yeah.
I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head?
What are you -
You never - ?
What are you doin'? You gotta get out of here!
Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy.
Yeah, what are you doin'? You okay?
No, I'm not okay.
She didn't know who to turn to.  She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage.
Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.
You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?
Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please?
Charlie, you've gotta - you've gotta stop her!
Legally, she can't take that stuff. Legally, she can't take the stuff.
She could at least lose half a pound or a quarter.  Listen...
To Abraham Lincoln.
What is it?
He wants a fifty-thousand marker.
Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please. Put him on.
Yeah, I know all that.
Right?
You sure?
It's nice isn't it?
Okay.
Huh?  Well, you know what? Now, I want you to tell me. I mean, my wife comes to me and asks me for twenty-five thousand. I mean, what do you want? Do you want a coat?
Okay? And you're embarrassing me. Why do want to make me feel so bad?
No, he didn't.
Look - for my ulcer, I take a half a one of these, a half a one of these. And that's when I have extreme pain. I had a three-month supply. What'd you do with 'em?
What do you mean?
Uh,  I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Would you knock it off, Sam?
Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your fuckin' guts!
I had a... salad.
Who were you with?
I ought to fuckin' have you committed. You fuckin' do that again,  I'll f-, I'll f-
Oh, sh-
Fuck you.
You fuckin' whore!
You understand? What? Let you go?
You want your jewelry?
So what? So who fuckin' blew you in the parking lot before you came in... huh?
In a  Wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license  denial, Rothstein followed several...
We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.
What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
Well, I... I never tried.
Mm.
You know where she gets this from!
Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though.
Fucker!
Um, I'm gonna need a bag. If you could just ask the guy for a big bag, okay?
Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside?
Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
Here we go!
You called my friend a faggot? You tell him to go fuck himself?
You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does.
Forget about it, Nick. Don't let it bother you.
He's comin' over.
Artie! Artie!
How are you?
I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay.
You see... I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. You understand?
Tell me.
Oh, you did? I didn't know that.
I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more. 
I understand that. But, you know, I think you should try to make the best of it now. Go slow, you know. See what happens.
All right?
Yes, you did.
A sponsor.
Oh, well, then, have him killed and get it over with.
Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it.
Get lost?
All right.
What does that mean? No, I know that look. What does that mean?
Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?
Yes, don't worry.
There's more!
God, I'm telling you, they're out!
Why?
And this is Stacy.
You must have drunk too much.
They'll do it.
Take it easy!
Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!
Fuck you!
I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean anything by it.
My fuckin' head.
No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -
...this, uh, this Commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application.
Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
Since when do you talk like that?
I know, but that's enough.
Hi.
Yes, uh...
You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
Have we reached the epi-center?
Yew'll be ovah in the naxt tehn minutes...
Cactus, I can't believe you just said all that...
Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
Nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out..
You're probably right.
Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
Stop. We are not having a "duality" conversation. "Ooh, he has a secret side.  Ooh, she has a dark side." Please.  Duality is a joke. You get one, do you understand me?  You get one life. One shot. I'm so tired of women saying "I have an inner strength" or "Deep down, I'm really ambitious." "One day I'll design my own line of clothing and write children's stories, if I can only remember to return the videos I rented last night." If you are something, then you better be out there doing something.  You need to be the same bold thing in the day that you are at night--with maybe a slight clothing change. There is no gray area. The truth is not somewhere in between. There are two sides to every personality, all right--the reality...and the lie. We are not having a "duality" conversation.
In many ways, that obnoxious creep Cactus was the worst one of all. He got off on giving out pain...
You've lost all motor functions. The poison will kill you in ten minutes.
At this point, a nap. Oh by the way, I killed your butler and your dog..
Even the skylight?
Cactus--shooting a man in the back is not very noble.
I'm supposed to be taking personality tips from you three?  You people were once heroes. You had ideals.  You fought for things.  Spooky told me so...
Ah, the good guys always triumph in the end. It's what allows our children to sleep at night.
"Save the City?" I don't want to save the city, I want to move!  Listen, I'm sure the computer disc is pretty fascinating and I can't thank you enough for the little weird gold thingie, but..
Oh, what?  I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."
Hey, you're anti-male.
A genuine woman of mystery in Oasisburg.  Amnesia. Bulletholes in exposed stomach badly concealed with body make-up.  Beautiful, intelligent eyes that have no business in "Frank's Fun Palace" or anybody else's Fun Palace for that matter..
I don't know what came over me.
Oh the hand--my grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender and..You know, I realize I've never officially introduced myself...I'm Lewis Lane.
What?
Not too cool...
What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
Is every single thing out of your mouth since your "accident" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?
What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"
Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..
But I'm not a hero. I'm nobody's heroine..I'm nothing. You've said so yourself many times.
I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
I don't see anybody in there but you.
Don't you have children?
He ran out on me to be with you? Well fuck him!  Everything worked twice as good without him.  We didn't need him then and I don't need him now.
What was that for?
Will you two cut it out?
I know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
Now that'd be a misdemeanor.
Yeah, I suppose getting whacked has got to be one of your best ways to die.  Particularly if you're not expecting it.  You don't know what hit you.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
Don't fuck around.  Pop a cap in him.
I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...
I don't believe you.
Oh won't I?
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
I don't know.  I hung up on somebody else a long time ago, and later on I wished I hadn't of.
I'm sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal.
Not a chance.
Jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago.
I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
Lenore -- you promised you'd follow instructions.  We're almost there.  Simply get out when they slide the van open and walk to me.
Yes.
Why can't it be her?
She's a child.  She might panic. She doesn't know me.  She might not come to me.  She might just run.
Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
At least one.
And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --
Tell them I'm keeping what's left. I earned it.  I probably killed some poor bastard for it.
You won't shoot me.  That's not your style.
The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
He wants 75 back.
Do you think they'll walk away?
Which one of us is elected to do the deed?
Naturally.
Thank God -- thank God I've got you.
Who are you working for?
Twenty percent.
Got a phone in that van?
I still don't see you.
We're waiting on you.
Count it.
What's he doing?  Answer me!
Call me "Nels."
You're going to have to see to it that both lanes of this road get blocked.
You researched me.  You know where I live.  She'll be waiting for you there along with your split.
Tailgate me.  I'll jam on the brakes.  You go into a spin to avoid an accident and cut them off.
Why would she want me to think you were on ice?
In the hills above Sunset.  Just below the Getty.
Five minutes.
Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.
You could always make it up to her.
See what, Dil?
He agreed that he was.
Good thing in a man.
Stop it, Dil --
Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.
Fuck off, Dave.
Did I?
Sure, Dave --
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
Is that his tart? Does Pat have a tart?
What's that supposed to mean?
Who?
Who's she?
Everybody wants something.
Perform?
Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a brace?
Do I?
Shouldn't you be in mourning?
He did sometimes.
Want to look after you.
You mean that?
Why?
What is this?
Tell him to stop messing Dil around --
Tell him it hurt --
I should have known, shouldn't I?
Am I becoming repetitious?
A little.
I miss you, Jimmy.
Not at all, honey.
What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong --
Shouldn't be, Dil
You could say that.
And you're not going to tell me more?
You're no good at this, Jimmy.
Don't call me that --
Are you all right, Dil?
What?
Your soldier.
Tell me you love me.
Whatever you say, Dil.
Yes. Now.
Will I see you again?
I've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy. I'm counting the days. Two thousand three hundred and thirty-four left.
What was it?
Need to lose myself awhile.
Have a look at him.
He's all right.
He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back. I tried to catch him. He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen.
So you did fuck up.
No way, Jude. I'm out.
Och, you do, Fergie.
You may be right.
Jude?
I take pride in my work.
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
You sure?
What the fuck is this?
You OK about that?
Peter.
What?
And what's she like between the sheets?
Definitely unusual.
Now, if you took the ropes off, I'd be able to feed myself.
No?
Well, I could say the same about you.
They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
No.
What?
She your wife?
You make a nice couple.
Thank you. I had a case of the clap two years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in all it's served me well.
Fergus?
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
We got simple tastes, you and me.
Do you?
Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?
Take the hood off, Fergus --
The fastest.
Not here.
What about it?
When you come on, you really come on.
I know why you're not taken -- no one can catch up with you.
That wraps it up -- Tex has the money. Go back to bed -- I'll let you know when I've found him.
I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.
But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
He's -- with the C.I.A. -- I've seen him at the Embassy.
I'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch. You are -- ?
We? You mean you're --?
Yes. We knew him, of course, by his real name.
Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.
Oh.
Dyle, or whatever his name is.
Describe him.
No.
No, what?
Steal it how?
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
Yes -- and he was there, too -- a little fatter now -- and less hair -- but it's the same one.
You'd lie about anything.
You can't prove it, can you? You're still trying to --  marriage license! Did you say -- ?
Very pretty. Now what?
I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
Because he's wearing moccasins.
Okay.
What are you doing?
Tuesday.
A) It's always the person you don't suspect; B) that means you think it's Tex because you really suspect Gideon; therefore C) if you think it's Tex, it has to be someone else -- Gideon.
I'd love some, thanks.
Don't worry, I'm not going to hit you.
Reggie -- open the door.
Then I suggest you call one of them.
Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.
I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
Do you have anything to eat?  And the orange one -- what about the orange one?
And the last one?
The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer.  Today it has a value of $100,000.  Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them.
Please keep it.
What for? If it's not here, why bother him?
Leave?
Swiss.
Where did he keep his money?
One wallet containing four thousand francs -- one agenda --  -- his last notation was made yesterday -- Thursday --  "Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs- Elysées"  Why there?
Obviously.  One ticket of passage to South America -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you --
We took the liberty of calling your dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we would learn something.
No -- in my room.
Voilà what?
I hope I don't find any little hairy things living up here -- wait! There is something! If I can just -- yes, I'm getting it -- a case of some sort -- it's heavy.
Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- !  What's that?
Why, do you think we're going to?
Please, not on my account.
Oh. I guess.
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
Do you know what you're going to do?
Doing what?
We'll find you a hotel.
You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
You mean you and me?
En garde.
How do you shave in there?
There are three men -- he's one of them -- they think I have something that belongs to them.
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
I wouldn't take that too seriously.
I believe what he said.
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
Because I don't love him.
Who is it from?
Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?
What's he up to?
Yeah?
Why?
What I don't understand is why they asked Marliston if Rod was a virgin. They could have asked you Cindy.
That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
Hi Jody.
Daddy you scared me!
It won't happen again.
I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything.
How much further?
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
You were eavesdropping.
No!
We need you here. I can bring her in.
Should we close down any eruption?
Well?
Of what?
I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.
Yeah. You should check downstairs.
Nope. The switchboard is lightning up downtown. Kids from other towns are starting to congregate in the parks and at the high school. It's turning into WOODSTOCK except there's no concert.
You gave me a 'D'.
You aren't going to the party?
Of course I'm scared.
He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore him.
Sandy, you have to chill out, at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. He can't butcher all of us.
Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
Ok.
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
Hi Jody. What can I DO for you?
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
Yeah. I think it's really sick.
What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?
You flaunt some slut in my face.
Oh GOD IT'S HIM!
I need to ask you something.
You can ask me anything.
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
Two men left town right after it happened.
Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have...
I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.
You ok?
What?
I said no.
Maybe it won't stay in.
Well I'm trying to be real here and you're mocking me.

It's a damn postal truck!
Oh...
Sam?  Andy gave Sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind.
Uh, between this month and last month, you owe four hundred and seventeen dollars.  And we need that in cash.
...Darlene pay you in cash?
Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.
...two things Andy is not.  Uh, but I tell you what.
...off.  Say, uh, three seventy-five. Seein' that we both have so much love...
Dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off.
...and a shitload of ice.
...ya?
Yeah, I believe him.  He was my friend.

There we go.  There we go.  Did you keep it safe?  Did you 
...excuse me.  Can you fix this?
No, no, no, no, no.  We gotta go to McGruder!  I go where the truck goes!
No way.  We're goin' through McGrud-...
I ain't playin' that.

...reconsider that statement there, Night Shift.  You're psy-...
I did not steal the truck.
 
Shut up, shut up!  It's beeping.
...waiting!
You  snatch that  phone  from me one more time, I'm--
Fuck! 
You think we can make what?!  You see that truck?!
Eight and a half feet wide!  Weighs over five tons!
Oh, shit.

Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.  Come on, old...
...wanna give it a try!
Come on.
What are you talkin' about?!  I'm the one drivin'!
Come on.
These'll keep it cold.
All right, let's go.
Yeah, he's a dangerous...
Keep still.
Uh-oh.
Okay.
Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You...
...truck.
You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State.
I remember him.  Got in a car crash or somethin'.
And I put the car into a ditch.  He spent eighteen weeks in the...
Couldn't deal with it.  So I split.
...-er.  It was your friend...
...Long.  Somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis...
...shit.
...split.
I think you oughta cut a...
 ...squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt...


Arlo, shut up.
You just can't leave that stuff with that lu-...
...to him. 
Here...
Mason.
All right 


Stop limpin' around like that.
Excuse me.  I got a bullet in my leg.
Who drove the ice cream...
Hello.
Us.  Owes us.
 Yeah.
What about all that "no need to get in the man's...
...face" crap you've been telling me?
You know, it's, uh-it's very hush-hush, as we say in the spy game.
My code name was Blackjack.  Night Shift was my coach.  Uh-Uh-Uh, I'm sorry. Mason was my coach.
What'd he say?
I got three thousand dollars of highly perishable ice cream products that taste bad enough when it's...

...such is the price...of patriotism.
So...where's my truck?
...Arlo, and you screwed me for it. Now, where's my goddamn truck?
...on ice!  We've got Elvis on ice!
...-tor Long.
What the hell is all this about a detonation today?  We're scheduled...
...to be off the island tonight.
Mm-hm.
Do you remember telling me once that all through my career, I'd never fit in?  Well...
...men every time I've closed my eyes?  But after you went away, I--
Pleasant surprise.
I can't say it's a surprise.
I checked your release date.  I never liked coincidences.
Or I may be wrong.  The breeze could be gusting south.  That'd be Billings...
...Destry, Fair Oaks....
...comes up that road.
You have no idea what you're in possession of, do you?
Of which we have more than enough.
Carl!  Set up the camera.
Hit him again.
Just when we have all the cards, Vaughn.  Take these two behind the van.
Get 'em in the  middle of the dam.
...to pursue a man who's stolen government proper-...
Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--
...screwup?
...look like you're after something more dangerous.
...your concern nor your fight.  Relinquish the package and you can go.
I don't see my container.


Why?  You're a nothing, nobody!  Why?
Oh, no?
Oh, you're two of a kind, doc.  Oh, he may not have your sheepskins, and...
Geneva just pulled the plug.
...now!
Great.  All right...
...tight!
Gomez, you fight the battles you can win.  Now, we've been outmaneuvered here.  Brynner's next move is gonna be to get Elvis out of the country and sell him to the highest bidder.  To do that, he has to have planned an exit point.  That's where we intercept him.  That's where we make our play.  Now you and your men back off.
And where are you going?
What the hell are you talkin' about...
Hey, doc.  Might wanna...
And I'm good at this.  Been doing it since I was a kid.  But you, I don't know.  Somehow you think...
...the master of his realm.
...without caution...
Some people might say you're readin' an awful lot in-...
...fishin'.

Mason.

Dr.  Long!
 ...miles. 
Nope.  Is there a prob-...
I didn't sell the boy any...
...stole a truck under arrest.
The Army, sealin' us in.
 Talk to me.
It's too late, Mason. I've...
...gotta seal it.
Negative.  Negative.
 There's ammo fire from Brynner's vehicle.
Look at that.
'Course you do, Jake.
A ruler?
It doesn't hurt.
Lou Escobar – he's a Lieutenant.
Do you know him?
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
I've got the photographs in my office. If they'll help you remember. What was the argument about?
Just find the girl.
She's fine.
What is it?
There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting.
Oh, my, yes.
The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
Either that or she'll be in jail.
Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.
...No...
I'll pay the rest next trip. We only caught sixty ton of skipjack around San Benedict. We hit a chubasco, they don't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore.
Curly, where's your car?
There's seven ashtrays in this room, Duffy.
Okay.
Where did you get this material?
I'd like to talk to him.
No. It was an accident.
I don't.
You really think I'm stupid, don't you, Gittes?
What are you talking about?
It's too late.
She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down for you.
What for?
Yeah.
Mrs. Mulwray, you don't want to run around like that.
...Well, it didn't make him happy...
No.
Yes.
That's not his apartment.
Did he know?
No, not for that one.
Yes. He never forgave him for it.
You sure shout that?
The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
Is that unusual?
I'll stay.
What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
You can't always tell what's going on there.
I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
And I want to know where.
It has to do with my father.
He owns it. You know?
This morning.
Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
What are you saying?
...no...
Back to Mexico.
Sophie, go to the little girl's room for a minute.
But, Mr. Gittes.
I think I got something.
Shut the fuck up!  ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?
Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
You'll find one of those people.
A Miss Sessions calling.
Of course.
Oh, good.
Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.
Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation.  I don't know what you're talking about.
I said, the northwest valley.
Do you know me?
Si.
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.
He's not in, Mr.?
He owned the entire water supply for the city?
How did they get it away from him?
Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
No, no. She said not to call, her husband might answer.
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that.
Neither do I.
That right?... She used to be some looker.
She ran off to Mexico. Rumor was she was knocked up and didn't even know who the father was. Went there to get rid of it.
What are you doing here?
How's school?
No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
You 're thinner...You can tell you've not been treated well. .
They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?
No. And nobody knows where she is.
Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him... 
Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed.  When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that the case?...You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born...But not now, it's impossible. Now you're blinder than I am. 
My name's Salvatore...And yours?
Hi, Elena!
But...who...
So what'd they say?
But I've never forgotten you, Elena!
Then where's the money?
Don Ciccio, I've got an idea...You remember that old abandoned movie house where they're supposed to build those low-rent houses?
That's all right.  We have no secrets from our readers.  Mr. Thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, Mr. Bernstein.  He knows what's wrong with every issue since I've taken charge. What's the cable?
I didn't see that.
I can't take shorthand.
It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  Wonderful. Wonderful.
Oh, yes, it's already made up.  Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
Well, then, how could he write that roast?  The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her.
Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me.  Just - 
Wasted?
Charlie?!
Sixty-two thousand -
Do you, Mr. Leland?
What's happened?
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
How do you do, Mr. Leland?
It isn't finished?
Has he said when he'll finish?
Almost two to one -
Emily!
It can wait.
You don't think I'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me, do you?
You decided what you were going to do, Charles - some time ago.  You can't always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened.  Come on, Charles.
What's the matter with you?
Thanks.
You're getting farther away all the time.  It's a duck.
Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you?  I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that -
No.  That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is -
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
Yes, I would.  That's why I asked.
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
I've got more than a right as far as you're concerned, Susan.
No, you're not.
Anything you say, Mr. Kane.  Only we're talking now about what you are.  That's what the note is about, Mrs. Kane.  Now I'm going to lay all my cards on the table.  I'm fighting for my life.  Not just my political life.  My life.  If your husband is elected governor -
Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
Mrs. Kane would like to see you, Mr. Kane.
Do you know what that is?
Take dictation -  Front page editorial -  "This afternoon a great man was assassinated.  He was the President of the United States -"
Charlie!
Do you think the "Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?
You're not going to like it in Chicago.  They wind comes howling in from the lake.  And there's practically no opera season at all - and the Lord only knows whether they've ever heard of Lobster Newburg -
You want love on your own terms, don't you, Charlie -  Love according to your own rules. And if anything goes wrong and you're hurt - then the game stops, and you've got to be soothed and nursed, no matter what else is happening - and no matter who else is hurt!
I know you will.
Yes.
Oh, yes, the bonus.
It does seem too good to be true, doesn't it, Mr. Bernstein?
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight, Charles. You'll be leaving on Number Ten.
Never mind -  Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he?  Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then.  He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.
The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
Maybe you should take that coffee outside.
We're not moving! We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard!
I take it she likes the guy.
Dick.
Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.
Why?
Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
No.
I love a macho façade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed.
He's not invited.
You're such an asshole.
Promise me it'll always be like that.
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
I can't believe this! I feel faint...
We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away.
What the fuck is this?! I want some service!
I can pass!
Are you open?
Dante, let me grab a Gatorade.
What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
Shit!
Why?
You win.
Seven months.
That's cheating?
You think things would be any different now?
Then I think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over.
And the second one was still being built when they blew it up.
Compliments of Lando Calrissian.
And you figured it out?
Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.
Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main?  All they know is killing and white uniforms.
What's he looking for?
He said it was important to have standards. He said nobody has pride anymore.
Can we talk about this later?
Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
There aren't.
You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.
I don't back down.
Sorry.
You've had sex with a dead person.
I'm gonna go to her wake.
Why not?
Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four.
Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
I'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season.
You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
Stop it.
His dick was in his mouth?
Balls resting on his lips.
I can't fucking believe you!!
Fine. Just lend me your car.
We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and RST video, respectively. As such, we have certain responsibilities which-though it may seem cruel and unusual-does include manning our posts until closing.
You know what? I don't think I care for your rationale.
The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?
What?
What'd you rent?  Best of Both Worlds?
I like to expand my horizons.
Because I'm here.
You're a snake.
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
There's no lights back there.
I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.
Thirty-seven.
Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
...If I wasn't such a fucking coward.  It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.
You were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so I figured I'd help you out.
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
How do you figure?
You need a ride?
Same time. What about you?
To say the least.
Do I know you?
I'm surprised you never found out about it, Dante. Everybody in school knew-even in my class.
Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym.
I am not.
Did you say Caitlin Bree?
What? When? When did all this shit happen?
Go open the video store.
And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.
Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
You used to go out with her?
You calling me a liar?
Actually, it is kind of rough.
Yeah, but...
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
I'm not even supposed to be here today!
What? What is that?
How much money did you leave up there?
Do you think anyone can see us down here?
A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.
How many what?
How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
You've slept with twelve different girls?
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
You sucked his dick!
Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
How many?
HOW MANY?
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
Lower your voice!
Well... why did you have to suck their dicks? Why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?!
Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back for the one-thirty class.
You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
You're damn right it's not like that! Because I won't let it be like that! You want your slut? Fine!  The slut is yours!
Maybe we should soap your hand or something.
Here you go.
I think the lady called it.
To an Asian design major.
Really?
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
I would've went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on the wall.
Which one?
You came for that too? That's the movie I came for.
I have first dibs.
I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.
Fuck you.
Jessie, girl this is insane. Weather stat called in wind gusts up to 50 knots for tonight.
What usually eats a banana?
I want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy?
Where are you, Walker?
I did what I thought was right.
Look, it was a bad time for everybody.
No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
I'm going with you.
Take the gun.
Sure you can.
That's a virtue isn't it?
Oh, my God!  I can't recognize the face, but the butt does look vaguely familiar. 
He knows it well.
Where've you been?
I don't understand?
Did I miss something?
I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
I can't.  The radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper.
Call me sentimental.
I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you.
Nice view, huh?
Gabe!  Are you alright?
They'll kill him!  He has no idea!
These old ropes can hold 900 lbs., each strand 300.  I'm 190, you're about 135 -- it just may hold.
If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.
Gabe?  Wait 'til I get over there.  Tie the rope so I can come across.
There's a lot more where that came from.  You're not leaving again?
Look here, the mountain man. You're Walker, right?
Your mouth's writing a check your ass can't cash, but if ya wanna buy some life, bring me the money.
Where's the helicopter?
No, he's gone.
Rescue One -- please be advised Ranger Walker is making advances toward my girlfriend that are liable to get his ass kicked right into space, over.
Got to be Comb Bluff.
You gotta be kidding me!  Do you want me to fly up after you? Over.
Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.
Of course. Food alright?
What the bloody hell d'you think you're doing?
Naughty, naughty, naughty, you filthy old soomaka.
So this is the young man?
But first we'd like to find out a few things about you.
It's past eight, Alex, you don't want to be late for school, son.
A rather intolerable pain in the head, brother, sir. I think it should be clear by this afterlunch.
Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now.
Well, er, I think that was something that they hadn't planned for, you see, Missus, I'm very fond of music and always have been, especially Beethoven, Ludwig van... Beethoven. B... E... E... He leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.
Thank you very much for this chance, sir.
Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?
Good evening, my boy.
Surprise?
Let me get up.
Do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses?
Do you wear any false teeth or false limbs?
The next morning I was taken to the Ludovico Medical Facility, outside the town centre, and I felt a malenky bit sad having to say goodbye to the old Staja, as you always will when you leave a place you've like gotten used to. Chief Guard briskly leads the way for Alex and escort. They move into reception hall where the Doctor stands.
Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?
I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial.
You mean like going to the pictures?
Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. That's what you're learning now. Your body is learning it.
Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.
Right... Knickers... Cabbages... It doesn't have a beak. Alex laughs. Slide of woman speaking to boy.
It's not that kind of a test. But you seem well on the way to a complete recovery.
One thing I could never stand is to see a filthy, dirty old drunkie, howling away at the filthy songs of his fathers and going blerp, blerp in between as it might be a filthy old orchestra in his stinking rotten guts. I could never stand to see anyone like that, whatever his age might be, but more especially when he was real old like this one was. The boys stop and applaud him.
I don't know what it's called, Father, all I know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again.
The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
Mothballs, sir.
Don't read it - sign it!
Hullo, son, how are you?
Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.
Shall we go to my office?
I'll take Sixth.  It's faster.
We taking bets?  What if you're wrong?
No?  How many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money?
Seventh, files section.  What should I do?
I was heading back to my garage.  It's on the way.
Come on, it's been a long, shitty day. How about a break?  I'll call a tow truck myself, I swear.  I won't budge from this spot.
Right through those doors.  The man himself.
No.
Jazz question.  What other kind is there?  You get it right, we roll with it.  You disappear.  Tonight.  You don't go home, you don't pack a bag, you just leave town...and nobody, I mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you again.
Tell me.  Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
Oh, right.  The guy flipped out or something?  Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?
Captain Walt Muldoon, NYPD.
You couldn't pick up a phone?  I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
What am I gonna do with flowers?
Oh.  Oh, thank God, hey!  Hey, guys, hey, help me out here!
I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
What are you guys, taking an all-night tour?
He'll keep calling.
It got crashed!  I didn't...
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...
How long you think this'll take?
Max.  May we leave the scene of the crime now, please.
I tried it.
How about the thingy next to it?
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
How?
Why?
It was an accident.  You're not liable.  Tell him.
I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
I need the job.
What?
Yes, Max?
But, hey, some good news.  This last one put me way ahead of schedule. We've actually got some time to kill.  Jazz?  You like jazz?
That what we're doing?  Flowing?
Leave me alone.
Don't even think you're walking away from me.
Pull your head out of your ass.  Get your thinking straight.  You wanna die?
You go every night?
Don't start.
Don't be.  I never saw him after I was 15.  Went into the military early.  So all this talk about "my job's temporary, I got big plans," it's all bullshit.
I told you I don't like to talk about it.
I don't get it.
I only owe you a ride, Vincent.
Who's Heller?
Head towards Union Station.
None of your business.
The sound of love.
But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
Mekong, my friend, Mekong.
Saved you last night's, too.
Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?  You want to go out sometime?
What is?
That's it?
You're a Holden Caulfield fan.
Never, but I've been practicing.
It was that painting.  The one on the wall.
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
Well, I've been tracking them down all morning.
Elaborate on 'they,' okay?
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
What was he doing down here?  A billionaire waiting for the subway?  Why not drown him in a bus?  Why drown him at all?  Why not shoot him?  Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis?  I mean, come on.
I don't know what to say.  I love you.
Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.
After you.  It's okay.  I'm the one who left it here.
How do you really know there's gold in Fort Knox?  Just because they say so?  We should go to Tennessee and demand to see it.
Did you kill my father?!
Yeah.  I know what it's like.
Without a song in my heart.
Don't die on me, Jerry.  Okay?
They changed Franklin's portrait.
I love you, too.
That's great.  Good for you.
We've arranged for you to take the blame.  Everyone knows how you've been harassing the poor girl.
You shouldn't watch, Jerry.  It's a moment without hope.
Liza Sutton is dead.
I like that.  A gun to your head and you ask about your partner. He's okay.  May have a headache for a few days.  Are you here with honorable intentions?
Can I ask you something?
And you have no idea where he lives?
The truth shall make you free.
Ask what you can do for your country.  That kind of thing.
As in <u>Catcher in the Rye</u>?
As in 'resulting in death.'  We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
It's okay.  I'm game.
Working.
Look, you're a nice guy, but I'm not really dating right now.
Jonas?
What gave me away?
We have benzel activation, repeat, we have benzel activation.  Control to Arroway, you okay in there?  Repeat, Control to Arroway, come back.
Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
Oh?  How's he doing?
I'm surprised you even knew it was an election year.
You know why I'm here.
David --
... could it be a nested code of some sort?
Ellie.
David... I know we've had our differences... but I've always thought of you as a fair man, even when we've disagreed -- and It's in that light I'm hoping you'll consider my request...
This... seemed best.
What does it say?
How can that be?
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
How's the spying tonight, guys?
Talk to him.
On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers.
And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
Many others.
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
So we passed some kind of test?
... life is unspeakably rare.  So whenever we do find another civilization, especially one that's... struggling... We send a message.  Sometimes we can offer help.  Sometimes we can't.  But we always try.  Life is simply too precious not to.
That isn't the way it works.
A machine.  But a machine that does what?
What are you talking about?  It's over.
He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
... I'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things I care about!  Or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like Drumlin, when if they'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts...
... I keep telling myself okay, that's just the price, you have to do your time doing shitwork before you're allowed to get to the good stuff... but if I have to catalog one more quasar...  God, I've missed you.
The V.L.A.?
Ellie -- are you okay?
That's one way of putting it.  Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe.  Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --
'My father's house has many mansions.'
Can you try?
I had... an experience.  Of belonging.  Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.
And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God.  To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something.  But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real.  Unless I have proof how can I be sure?
Ellie --
So.  The final countdown.
What?
-- I don't know --
I can't hear this now --
So.  I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.
Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said:  ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
I'm not sure...  Maybe it simply exists in the search for it.  Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
Dr. Arroway, you are entitled to your opinion.  But we feel quite strongly that it would by both irresponsible and naive to send a human being into a completely unknown, completely uncontrollable situation absolutely defenseless.
But --
Git your shovel and git to work.
Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on 'em.
Oh, I had me some high old times. Yore old man, Luke, wasn't much for stickin' around, but damn it he made me laugh.
What went wrong?
You allus had good jobs, and that girl in Kentucky I taken a shine to her.
That's good: he earned it.
Lookit her bounce.
Comin' out here, Boss?
She's on to him. You shoulda waited fer me to git her out -- loose like she is, he kin run her crazy.
That's right, Captain. Just passin' the time.
Dragline, lemme look at the picture.
Oh we got our sources... Tearing the heads off... what was it... gumball machines? What kind of thing is that for a grown man?
Slow down, man. They ain't passing out medals for slinging dirt.
Man, this here Newmeat parking meter bandit thing what calls itself Luke don't know nuthin' 'bout nuthin'.
Fifty's a nice round number.
'Atsa sign I got me an affectionate nature.
Not a liar. You just have a common -- and likable -- tendency toward exaggeration.
Man! It's gonna be one hot muther today.
Back a buck.
Picture's a phoney... Cost me a week's pay.
You can't switch 'round jobs, anyway. I figured he knew that.
Stop that.
You ain't man enough to wear them!
Oh God.  I'm really crazy.
Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
I'm the only friend you've got, darling, and I don't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us.
We'll get the paramedics...
You don't listen very good.  This break in -- I can call it a felony -- three strikes, and you got about sixteen strikes already, and you're in jail for the rest of your life, no parole.  Or I could see it gets forgotten.
What Friday?
Where is it?
You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago.  You read it yet.
I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
Mm-hmm.  I can't get to you.  You have to come to me.
For God's sake Peter, leave her out of it.  You don't want her, you want me.
Yes.  I do.  I want it to end now. Let her go.  I'll come -- just let her go.  She's not important.
Kill me, Peter, do it, now.
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
How did you know they were stockings?
If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  Now, I've done what you asked me.
But it's a different m.o.
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping."  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it.
Ruben.
Consistency is the hobgoblin of <u>little</u> minds.  Tell them to test for the chemicals found in Windex. That's a product for cleaning with...
I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows...
They put  Merry <u>Saks</u> on it?!
He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
Helen -- let go.  You've got to let go.
MaryJane.  We call her M.J.
Are you always so bold?
<u>What</u>?...
Yes.
Is there a phone booth there?
Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a pattern develop...
I was.
Don't put yourself down like that. I <u>never</u> used you.  I worked my way up like a marine grunt!
Just horseshit luck.
Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...
Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
I tagged the goddamned stocking. It ain't lost.  We're sequestering that evidence.  That's the trap some son of a bitch is going to fall into...
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.
It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests...
That was Bundy.  He killed forty of them, identical, long hair, parted in the middle, alike as Barbie dolls.  ...this is hopeless.  Let's try to get time for a police spokesman to appear on college radio and TV hookups and broadcast a warning?
We were together six years, sir!
Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
Where were you?
Did you come?
If I groundloop during my flying lesson on Saturday you might wake up and find me next to you.
It is?
I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine.
Have you seen his penis?
The airport? Why? Are you leaving?
A complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition. Definitely not part of the big auto show. There's a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location.
Why are the police taking this all so seriously?
You could get your wish at any moment.
I need to see you, Ballard. I need to talk to you about the project.
I'm the only doctor making rounds this morning.
I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
First you tell me to do what I want to, then you tell me to stop.
So, we'll meet every Tuesday and Friday. And if you have any kind of emergency, you can page me.
It was just a little going-away gesture.
Go on, Letty. I want to see it on you.
That settles it. I'm never leaving.
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
Paul could pop the question at any time.
Mom, please.
I gather he's late as usual.
Oh, Letty, what happened?
It's so good to see you, Sweetheart.
Mom, we agreed. You can visit, but you're not allowed to mention Michael.
You've been so great. I just feel a lot clearer about things.
Chair, cup and ball.
Guess which hand.
A small price.
I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
You're right. I guess I was projecting. What I should have said is, "It's a good thing I love you."
No, I need some serious household advice.
This is it -- 3B.     Check it out.
Wow.
Hey.
Did I get spaghetti sauce on my face?
You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
Aunt Lily?
Something like that.
Silly?   Silly am I?
So, another one bites the dust.
I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come.
Especially now.
You don't have to say anything else. I've known for a while that this was coming.
Who?
What?
All tapped out.
You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place.
Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
Hey man, you can't do that!
I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go?
Where's your brother?
You don't trust me?
Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big--
Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about the Van Gogh.
I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back.
I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills.
Okay.   How much?
Half the tapes.
Tonight?
Because you're the closest.
Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!
Bring me the scissors.
Cut his pants up the leg to the groin.
We had a chance to walk out of Zammito's house.
It's not?
Can I trust you, Sami?
Hey you guys are becoming famous.      I was just watching the news and--
Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
Everything.
Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.
Can you believe that guy?    What a moron.
The map said to go left.
No, I didn't.
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
This kind.
I don't know.     Maybe if we did just leave --
I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself?
It's good.
I represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother.
No problem, man.  Hey, you wanna hit?
How are we going to do that?
I would like to thank you for your hospitality.  If you are ever in Paris here is my number.
You're not helping.
I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can use.
So, how did you get hooked up with these guys?
The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information.
Can't sleep?
So, I just come by to see how you're doin'?
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
A little?
This Jade Fox is a woman?
Then leave her to me.
Why do you want to teach me?
Hello.  What is your name?
Please sit.
Put them down.
This spells trouble.
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
Please.
No, really?
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
Don't distance us.  From now on, let's be like sisters.
You, sister...
They forced me to marry!
Lo?
You coward!
Jen...
You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's. On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's.  Were you involved?
No, not yet...
No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.
Then, why did you come?
You're mistaken.  We're just street performers.  We were rehearsing.
They're gone.
Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?
Don't thank me.
I mean, I've done what I came to do.  It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass...
You're welcome.
Don't interfere.
You look like a rock star without a job.
My mom works over there.  I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.
What's going on...?
In a better place.  I hope.
I don't know if I can.  But you have this... and you know where to come.
I know your friend, too -- the one that looks like a rock star.
That's ancient history.
Cute nickname, don't you think?
You're too late.  There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  But he turned to dust and blew away.  I don't have any power for you to take.
Shelly?
Glad to see you're finally with the program.
Don't waste my time.
Who is only invulnerable so long as he cares about the dead.  When he begins to care about the living, you'll find his heart can bleed... and I want it to bleed for me.
One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
I have his journal.
His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.
I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
Forever.
Junior.
You a lesbo?
Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends.
Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse.
This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person.
No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
Thank you.
Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
You don't even know me.
Who?
How about tonight?
You truly want to do something to make me happy?
Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
What are you doing?
What are you reading?
Oh please.
I do.
Lighten up.
Oh dear, are you actually laughing?
Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.
You really want to know?
Yes.
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
Good for you.
What are you saying?
I love you.
Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?
He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.
It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
Well, I guess it's getting late. Please thank Kathryn for the use of her Steinway.
That's great.
What are you scared of?
Okay.
That's so romantic. Have you responded?
Of course I would. We're friends, right?
Calm down. Tell me what's wrong.
What do you mean?!
Well did you like it?
Excellent.
You promised to let me kiss you.
Good night Cecile.
You do?
Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
Annette Harrison? I don't know what you're talking about.
Yes!
I'm pretty sure she did.
I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over.
Racist piece of shit.
Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way.
I see your point... though why should I care?
Care to make a wager on that?
I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter?
Who are you calling?
Are you really? I mean, we've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this... I mean, we're destroying an innocent girl. You do realize that.
Yeah.
Shut up.
And that's why you're losing your bet?
So what went wrong?
It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
And that's why you're leaving?
Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.
Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
Why so nervous?
Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.
I think you have your answer.
It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.
I know. She's so young and he's so -
Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
Hi. Is Annette at home?
It's desperate that I talk to her.
I'll do that.
I said, do you want some water?
Do you mind if I check upstairs?
It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
to a situation) Really, Mr. Reed, there isn't anything to worry about. It was only a slap --
That the old actress -- Julia Farren?
It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.
What do you mean?
It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
I wonder if you don't resent that in her?
Where is everybody?
You're shouting at me.
Where did you get it?
I thought you were with Amy.
Can't you tell me later?
It was just a voice.
Daddy?
You wouldn't understand. I come from great darkness and deep peace
Can't you get it, darling?
Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
You and I shall enjoy Christmas together. Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?
May I pet the deer?
It's you...Irena...my friend!
A lady threw it to me.
They're given to the living in memory of the dead.  If this is a real one -- I can't be sure -- you can make a wish, and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye.
Bad luck to see death in the snow.
Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days — those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
I like stories.
Hide me? Why?
Mother! You called me by name!
It's dark. We'd better be getting on. The family will be waiting.
Everything all right down there at the school, Mr. Reed?
"To Daddy from Amy." Here's one for Miss Callahan. This one says, "To Edward from Amy.".
Something to do with a butterfly-- they were quarreling about it.
It all starts with them going to the bathroom together.
Waiter! She needs more water.
Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful.
A dog at Victoria's Secret?
Translation: a total geek.
My shrink says he's not so bad.
Frida, I don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about PMS around men.
Do you really need these?
Can you believe she fuckin' bit me?
You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.
There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
And he was ripped limb from limb?
You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
He was cute, huh? Of course whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing no make-up.
Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.
Give him the tampon test.
What did he say?
Charming Carlton.
Bag means condom now? I can't keep up with the word "bag." It used to be "No, that's not my bag" -- meaning not my thing. But now "my bag" means "my fault."
Frida, this is a bad time. We're having sex and George actually answered the phone.
And what makes you think you killed a man?
It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
No.
Peter keeps asking me out.
Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years.
What choice do we have?
But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me?
I know.
Oh come on. Knock it off.
You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.
So pay them back and apologize.
Script coverage?
No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why.
I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
I'm sorry.
We lived in northern Minnesota. She went for a walk one night and they never found her body -- just her torn apart clothes with her blood and wolf blood on them. Then the town rounded up bunch of hunters and shot all the wolves in the area.
Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something.
You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.
Yeah. Maybe.
I'm a cop -- I notice everything. That drawer's ajar, that picture's been moved about an inch, the closet wasn't closed when I left...
You had a date with Carlton?
I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
That's it? Hell my mom chased my dad around with a knife when she had it. She made us call her a different name. She'd say, "You're talking to Betty now" and we'd leave the house for a few days.
Is that how you feel?
Go away. I might hurt you.
Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
You got a dog?
No he's not. He's a courier. He picks up packages from the airport.
It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.
Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
See he was cheating from the get go.
He was found a few blocks away.
Hey, there was a lot of blood.
Nah, East Village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park.
What are you talking about?
What of?
All the same entry wounds.  It's definitely him.  She lives...  lived here.  A prostitute.
The other one?
They don't speak English...
He tried to kill me!
Just visiting my patient.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Was that for real down there?
Iíve taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompsonís office searched, as I believe you instructed.  All clear now, sir.  They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man.
That was a pretty good escape act at the station.  How did you do that?
Such a joker!  Like your father.
You know something about me?
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
Known me for long?
Did she drown?  The woman you told me about?
No, it's the truth.
Is this dangerous or anything?
Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  All you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
Die, you pond scum!
The guy's in a coma, Bob.
I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
When does it break?
Three years.
Bob...
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
He's only doing what you told him to.
What do you mean by that?
So you want to go swimming?
I just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be.
Thanks. You did great.  Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something.
I'm afraid so.
President vetoes works bill?
Mr. Kovic.   We're not here about your taxes.
Your government needs your help.
What?
Yeah.
You got a gun?
First thing they teach you at the academy.  `Don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my King.'
Thanks for doing this, Ellen.
I care about the homeless.
... How could I what?
I saw the light.  I thought maybe you were up.
You don't have to keep walking with me.   I'm okay from here.
I really don't have much of an appetite.
You mean when I'm not running the country?
... Not exactly the Oval Office.
Did you get someone to double for me there, out front?
Oh yeah.  Did you take care of later on?
All set.
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
What do we do? Let'em know we're here....or what?
It can't be. Are we truly in hell?
I'm sorry, General, if I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I don't believe due process is being served by...
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
How long do we have to watch him?
Ain't no place safe.
That entrance is closest to the labs and the Bee cages.
That's the general alarm. Jesus! They musta got in!
Dios mia.
You gave them a fresh taste of blood!
You can't run away from the planet, Miss Science. You can't even run away from the island, heh heh.
Oh, I have no doubt.
If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
Sir. In the matter of the State versus Private Tyler, I don't want to...
I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.
It's been fired.
What'dya get?
Well, I'd better find Patsy.  Say hello to Mutt for me.
Charlie Dalton.
Well hell no, Charlie, but that's not the point.  That's not the point at all!
What is the point?
Ahh!  Eat it, Dalton!
I here and now commit myself to daring!
You're siding with Mr. Nolan?!  What about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that?
Yeah!    Don't you guys miss having girls here?
What good will that do?
So, uh, where are you in school?
Chris!
If Chet sees you, he'll kill you, don't you know that?
Chris!
Knox, why are you doing this to me?
I promise.  Dead Poets honor.  Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.
I have to go home. Chet might call.
Yes sir.
Very good, Mr._?
Meeks.
We used to meet here on special occasions. Who would like to convene the meeting?
Your reprimand made quite an impression I'm sure.
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
Courtyard?
A sweaty-toothed madman
Maybe they don't want worldly things distracting me from my teaching.
You can't live a life for someone else, Neil.  You can only live for yourself. Have you told your father what you just told me?  Have you shown him your passion about acting?
Give your father the benefit of the doubt.  Talk to him.  Let him see who you are.
Yes sir.  I'm sorry.
You know me, always taking on too much.
Weird.
My parents wanted me here all along but my grades weren't good enough.  I had to go to Balincrest to pull them up.
I... I just don't want to come.
They're putting it on at Henley Hall. See, open try-outs.
So?
So I'm gonna act!  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.  Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
From my father and Nolan.
This is your desk set.  I don't get it.
They are...they are everywhere.
We don't even know if his boat is still there...you saw Billy!
And what? These things are octopusses?
Right here...middle of nowhere...
How soon can we get up and running?
We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
Now, where's Mulligan? Where's Vivo?
Did you clear this?
That's where my boat's moored.
What's that supposed to mean? You people.
Anti social?
I don't know where it is!
I don't take orders at all.
Where's you friend?
You don't give a shit about anything do you?
Finnegan, what the hell was that?
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
I've never seen you so congenial with a mamber of the opposite sex... The two of you got a nice patter going...got a nice rapport...
She fucked you?
What?
Ammo! Get the ammo!
You're full of shit!
Fuckin' A. It's gotta!
It's Nick!
Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
In case!!! The gun's in case!!!
Albert! For Christ's sake... John! Wait a minute, you guys!
Look who's talkin'! Jes'! He got married! Vince got married!
You talk to him?
I have to go.
See, I'm going home.
Yeah... Do you mind if I sit?
I love Linda, see. I love Linda more than I can even say.
No.
Get 'em! For Christ sake, get 'em!
'Course how could you miss, right? Twenty, maybe thirty feet. I mean, if I'd'a been where you guys were --
Nick! Hey, Nick!  Boy! Boy oh boy! Are you okay? You're okay, huh?
No?
Sal.
Nick, she won't say why.
Please! Please mister, please! This is vital I go to Saigon. This is very important. Most important.
Linda... Hey, Linda...
What?
Frost.
Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
Nick?... I just want to say how sorry I am about Sal and about Merle. How... I know you loved them and I know it's not the same. I mean now.
What are you doing?
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
Yeah... All the guys, we're all going huntin'. Like we did. You know? Like we always used to.
Playing.
This is horrible!
So do I.  I want to be ready... You have to be ready... It has to be there, in your mind.
Pow.
Tomorrow I go with Vince.
What else?
What do you mean?
How many bullets?
Merle...! Jesus! Hey, how are you?
I like it, Nick.
No.
Great. Hey. That's great.
Listen, Nick --
Sal, you're gonna die! You're gonna sit in that corner watching soaps and you're gonna die!... I'm not saying it's gonna be the same. It's not gonna be the same, but whatever it's gonna be we're all gonna do it, Sal. God damn it we are! We are gonna do it!
Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.
You didn't get a deer?
He's getting married... and we're nuts!
Great. Feels great... Fuckin' A!
No.
Yeah.
And I believed you! I oughta punch you out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey, let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey, Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do you say? Nick? What do you say?
Quiet!... Quiet!!!... Awright, everybody, Nick has a few words.
Michael called yesterday.  He wants to take Willy for the summer.
Kimberly!
My man Dubbs.
I want to ask you a few questions.
I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
Tell Frick and Frack that means them too.
You can't kill me.  I'm going to be Mayor tomorrow.
Doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away.  I'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody.  What's your status?
Need help?
Not the 'T' word.
Got it.  Ejection seat?
See those guys?
We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
How then?
Sir, I took the liberty of running a GCI scenario on a TM-1 earlier today...
Yeah.
Hey, I'm eating.
...Have you been drinking?
You okay?
What are you doing this for, Sanchez?
I just heard.
This is the guy that killed my partner.
What's it mean?
He had a partner.  Our own Ray Gallagher.  He tagged Wade dangerously defiant. Psychotic.  Reckless.  Seems our Commissioner didn't like him much. Busted his buns on a narcotic's violation.  Wade was sentenced to twenty-five years.
This little thing says I can't.
I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself.
Yes, you did, Daniel! I saw it from the window. And then to lie about it! Give me that beanshooter, Daniel!
Daniel! ... You must go to sleep.
Howdy, Hank.
Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
What's the matter with you?
Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
Leave your tongue off of that!
Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --
I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
Here's a man who knows what's good for Dan'l Webster! Medford rum! Ah, a breath of the Promised Land!  To the champion of the Iron Horseshoe, Jabez Stone!
Mr. Webster -- I'd like you to meet my wife, Mary.
You, Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?
Not long -- now.
You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?
Oh!
Howdy, Squire! Howdy! Oh -- how do you do, Squire.
How much?
Well, I'll be -- there's a rig, turning in, by the gate.
Not all of it?
It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens.
Jabez! Couldn't you take a sack of seed instead?
To save us work on the spring plowing?
Remember, Mary, how he said it: "Couldn't have done better myself, Jabez Stone," and it was my first speech. I don't know what came into me, Mary. I just stood up and the words came flowing like water out of my mouth.
There's hope and promise in it, Jabez -- Planting and promise of good harvest to come.
No, no. I don't want to be idle.
Isn't that your own fault?
It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all.
How'd you know to have the calf ready, Ma?
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
I dunno.
I feel -- fidgety, Ma -- not right at all.
Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma?
What's that you say, Son?
I say -- it don't matter.
You throw mighty far, Jabez -- almost into the pigsty.
So you've made up your mind to go to the party.
Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.
Of course not --
You don't have to defend him to me, Mary -- I've been called names myself.
Mr. Webster, I presume?
Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name?
Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.
Very well. -- You shall have your trial, Mr. Webster. The case is hardly one for an ordinary jury --
Your Honor -- gentlemen of the jury -- this case need not detain us long. It concerns one thing alone -- the transference, barter and sale of a certain piece of property, to wit, his soul by Jabez Stone. That transference, barter or sale is attested by a deed. I offer that deed in evidence and mark it Exhibit A.
The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold, Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense.
Meanwhile, you still live in New York?
You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?
It's okay, it's okay.
What are you going to do?
Hey, I read the papers, I watch 60 minutes, I say to myself, these guys are professionals, they're motivated, they're happening. They want something.  Now, personally, I don't care about your politics. Maybe you're pissed at the Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's none of my business.  I figure, You're here to negotiate, am I right?
'Asian Dawn Movement?'
Yes...I know about them.  The code key is a necessary step in accessing the vault.
You...you're an American?
New York...
Put it down now.
...the circuits that cannot be cut... are cut automatically in reponse to a terrorist incident...You ask for miracles, Theo...I give you the FBI...
Nice, but one of us is three hours out of sync.  I think it's me.  Is there a place I can wash up?
Oh, here it comes.  One of those 'meaningful relationship conversations.' I never should've let you get those magazine subscriptions --
You wife's made for this business. She know how to drive a hard bargain.
I'm here, cowboy.
Eleven years ago.  Oh, it was dark... he was big for his age...damn ray gun he had looked real enough...yeah, I had all the right excuses...but afterwards... I really couldn't draw my gun again.
I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
He claims?  Powell, has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists, pulling your chain? Or some kind of nut case who --
What's it look like?  We're going in.
Goddamn, didn't you hear him!  He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them --
Gene -- you smilin'?
What if we gotta kill a whole lot of people?
If you're right I'm gonna back you a hundred percent, you know that.
You'll be okay.
Heidi, I'm dying.
I know you can't stand me to say I'm fat.  Like I can't stand you being a bank robber.  I guess that's what love is -- huh, Sonny?
No.  Look, we're kind of....
Hello.  Hello, Leon.
Well... I'm out of the hospital.
Ooohh....
Yeah.  It was terrible.
You can't talk or do anything.  You really feel... you know... I'm just sort of coming out of it now.
Fine, thank you.  I'm in trouble. That is... now I am!
No really... I don't think that you realize what it means.  The things that you do, Sonny.  You put a gun to somebody's head...
You're crazy.
You're really crazy.
Huh ... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for.
All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
Yeah... yeah!
Yeah.
How many you got in there?
What do you want to know that for?
Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
Call me whatever you want.
He wanted to kill me!
I want to see my wife.  I want you to bring her down here.
You tryin' to fuck me?
No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you.
Sonny, your wife's on the way ... We reached her ... your wife's on the way ... everything you asked for, you got.
There won't be ... there won't be ... What else do you need?  How else can we help you?
All right ... I got some hungry people in there ... I want to get some pizza ... some stuff like that ...
He's all doped up.
I must of been outta my mind.
Believe me, I'm on your side.
Don't ask me questions.  I got connections.  You find out who I am, you're cold meat.
You like me?
Why not?
Little smoke: like a Polish four- alarm fire, is all.
You were terrific, too!
Pure?
You know, you remind me of my 19- year-old brother - only he's got his hair down to his knees - he looks like something that eats berries and roots out of the ground. God forbid I should say something to him like, 'Listen, if you ever smoke marijuana, just remember that it's illegal' and he storms outta the house.  You rob a bank, but you keep your body pure, is that it?
What?
But do you mean in? ... But you just told him that if worse comes to worse...
I want him to think that.
... because if you're talking about coppin' a plea, I'm tellin' you right now, there's no deal ... I'm never going back to prison ... We got our own deal already ... Do you remember the pact we made?  You and me and Jackie - that night in the bar ... we were talkin' about if we get trapped in the bank, what are you gonna do ... Right?  What did we say?  What did we say!
At the airport.  We get on the plane, check it out, and if it's all okay we'll send them out. Except one.
What can he do, he's clean...
I can't allow that, Sonny...
He's got diabetes.  He's not a well person.
My kids ... Kimmy and Jimmy.
My God, Sonny - you oughtta see - Alla Brooklyn is here!  On all 3 networks!
Mom - I got it all worked out; it's over.  The best thing is you go home.  Watch it on TV.
I said you were never a faggot.
Mom - they're sending a bus to take us to the airport.  You understand? If you're here - they're not gonna send it.  They'll think I'm gonna come out with you.
Did I say a thing against her?  God forbid I should say anything against that fat cunt.
The audience is interested in you, Sonny ... not me.
This is Bishop.
Hello?
<i>What is it?</i>
Where is the money?
I think that you're lying. I think you know exactly where the money is.
Are you aware that Lateesha Rodriguez has been running a counterfeit driver's license racket?
Crypto-fascist? Who talks like this?!
Stop it.
So who is this <i>Choko?</i> Is he your new boyfriend?
We're late.
This girl is going to be a star. She just tells it like it is.
Ain't nobody gonna call me a bitch without some payback.
We shouldn't buy a single slice, spend a single penny in that motherfucker till some people of color are put up in there.
You almost knocked me down.  The word is "excuse me."
Excuse me.  I'm very sorry.
I'm gonna leave now.
Did you ask Sal?
I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
What did I tell ya 'bout dat noise?
How come you ain't got no brothers up?
You the man.
Mother Sister, you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years. What have I ever done to you?
Where did you sleep?
I hope the block is still standing.
Mookie.
Gotta go.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
What makes Sammy run?
Do me a favor.  Go to work.
Later for Sal.  Y'know, sometimes I think you're more concerned with him than me.
No.
I'll see you out.
He's just being nice.
This might take some time.
Sorry, comb got caught.
C'mon, don't be shy.  Mmm, smells good.  This is ya Love Daddy talkin' to ya, starvin' like Marvin. Say something, Mookie.
Here ya are.  Keep the change.
Depends.
Sal, I don't care if you fire me this exact minute, leave my sister alone.
You must be guilty of something or you would have never come in saying the things you said.
No.  What are you gonna do?
I work too, but I still make time.
Bring some ice cream, I'm burning up.  Do you love me?
Shit!  I forgot.
Later for you.
Where are you going?
And not Larry Bird?  Who's your favorite movie star?
Keep dreaming.
Dago, wop, garlic-breath, guinea, pizza-slinging, spaghetti-bending, Vic Damone, Perry Como, Luciano Pavarotti, Sole Mio, nonsinging motherfucker.
Mister Señor Love Daddy is cool.
That's what you think?
I just copped them.  Let me tell you the story of Right-Hand--Left- Hand--the tale of Good and Evil.
I'm listening.
I know this.
Vito!  Pino!  Let's go.
But I came here to learn about America.
Excuse me.
In the new library there.
Do you thill want to do an arwticle on me, Jethica?
Oh, you want to talk about your delicates?
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
Why didn't you tell us your boyfriend was Principal Collins?
Wow just like Marco Polo.
Cool.
I don't know. I'm pretty familiar with the school and I've never seen that "X". But... I do know something.
God, she's beautiful. My wiener's all tingly.
Can we eat there tomorrow?
Who's Captain Rob?
Where did you learn that word?
I didn't know that.
Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
When you live in the basement of the school, you breathe in a lot of chalk dust. It writes out all the answers on your brain.  Now how about a slushee?
Some what?
But-
Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you-know-what.
Am not.
Hey, it's Jessica.
He's like the Pope. Like we're gonna snake a girl away from the Pope.
Well, I'm listening now.
How true. But I still feel I deserve more than you do of this treasure. I mean, I found it.
What was it Jessica wanted us to do with this chest again?
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
What? What did we do?
Oh my god. Can you believe your ears?
Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
You take her.
I thought I told you to get lost.
My parents are going to wonder where I am.
Special Needs class.
Checking up on my friend, Harry.
So could you get us into the principal's office?
What are you doing?
That's it. I'm done.
That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?
That's the downside. There is none.
It was meatloaf. You just put everything in your soup.
You know I do!
How was that?
We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!
I don't think he'll smell anything - just make sure he takes the check. I've been through this a hundred times.
I am strong!
It's the big potato.
Anyway, the state is giving a hundred thousand dollars in his name to every school that has a Special Needs class.
Oh, this is fantastic. So all we have to do is kill this Moffit guy and we get all the money!
Knock knock.
It's a surprise.
Oh, things. Photos. Tapes. I tape everything that goes on in this office.
So the chest is still out there somewhere.
This is horse?
A Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here within minutes!
Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
No music. I'm packing this for the crossing. Shield practice.
What's gotten into Gurney? He's not faking. Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade right at Gurney's neck.
Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us of.
Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen.  I will try to pass within.
Death may be the result....  Are you sure?
What does she fear?  What about my Father?
Where are we do you think?
Remember... walk without rhythm and we won't attract a worm... it'll go to the thumper.
Cinnamon... the spice!  Do you smell it?
Spice!... pure un-refined spice!
We call that one Muad'dib.
THE PAIN!
You mustn't speak of...
Really?
You know, I saw you perform "Dracula."  In Poughkeepsie, in 1938.
The pure horror, it both repels and attracts them.  Because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth.  The blood. The blood is horror.
Let me take you to the hospital.
Goulash.
You'll be sitting on the right.
What is this place?
Let's shoot this fucker!  Where do I go?
Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream?
Bela, I've got twenty-five scenes to shoot tonight.
Don't worry.
Eddie, I wanna make another picture. When are we gonna make another picture?
So Eddie, don't we need a sound crew?
Okay.  But what if I'm not in <u>too</u> big a hurry?  What if I take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life?  To smell a flower?
Yeah, she's really somethin'.
PLACES, EVERYONE!  ROLL CAMERA!
This is kind of a stream--
And who may you be?
Isn't he?
What?
Better than not getting a job?
Who?  Robert Taylor?!
No!  A horror movie star!
Oh, the hell with you.  I met BELA LUGOSI!
How long have you been doing this?
None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part.  The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller.  The title is "Bride Of The Atom."
I don't know... this is all a lot to absorb.
It's a guaranteed blockbuster!
"Perfect"?  Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
Mr. Reynolds!
Glad you could fit me in your schedule.
Could we moovf to table?
But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.
I'd be happy too, if I had such a great family.
What is happening?
Can I help you?
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
Are you a fruit?
And what's with this new title?!  My poster says "I CHANGED MY SEX"!
Ed!  What's with these revised pages?!  A scene in a smelting factory?  A buffalo stampede?? <u>Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio</u> <u>Beach</u>??!  What's going on here?  I can't afford to film this nonsense!
Gee, I used every frame of film we shot.  Maybe they won't notice.
Um, I guess --
Did you find it boring?
I had to sleep with the lights on for a month.  But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that.
No, BIGGER!  What's the biggest energy??
But it's pouring.  And the car top is stuck!
No.  I think my film is perfect for you.
Yes!
Norma, this is Bela -- Bela, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Tor -- Tor, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Paul Paul, this is Norma.
Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu."
Isn't it wonderful?  Bela lives!
This is our choir director.  He's gonna play the young hero.
Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that.
No! Do they show you having sex?
Is Mom here? I gotta talk to her.
She's in the kitchen. I'd yell for her, but I'd die.  You had a busy night last night.
Yeah, so... ?
Al!
I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights.
Okay, so you understand? We're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, plus, of course, there'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you.
I bet my career on you. You'd better be good.
Yes, Ed.
Could we just talk alone for a second? I --
Yeah?!
Ed, do you want my advice?
Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!
This guy.
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
What?
Tell me.
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
Yeah, a thing. He became a big hero. He was on TV and there was a parade and a movie about him
Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time.
He had girlfriends!
Chicken pox? I was six. He didn't leave 'til I was twelve.
Mom?
What's the matter?!
Oh God. What hospital?
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!
And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
Hi, Mom. 
No.
What are you talking about?
Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.
They're gonna mock our foibles.
Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it. It's "Star Search." You wanted me here because the camera comes with me.
I batted!
Dynamite.
So maybe this is my dynamite.
Really?
What are you doing?
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
Page three of the Post.
Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
You see how people look at me. Like when they ask for my autograph or say "Hi" to me... It's like I'm a basketball player or a... you know, like I'm someone.
Let's have a contest. Now this would mostly be open to professional investigators and detectives. But anyone can join in.
Why do you do that?
That's right. You don't know. Doors don't fly open for guys like us.
Ray --
What's the dif --
You watching the ballgame?
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
What is this? What's going on, who is that?
I don't even know her. All I know is she likes Snapple.
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
No -- keep it.
I'm Jill. I really like your show. I think you're great.
Can I help with anything?
pierdes.
El/ella -
In love?
Yeah, it's serious.  I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.
Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...
Tracy, I've been watching you for going on two years now, and I think you are one of the most talented, hard-working, sensitive, attractive, brilliant students -- no, human beings -- I have ever met.  I mean, you're the real thing.  Special.
Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.
Yeah. No. I mean, you know.
Having a problem with your eye there?
What d'you got?
Yeah?
But, they were there I counted 803 votes.
I know.
Tracy.
Aren't you supposed to keep them?
These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.
I guess you know why you're here
6:30.  How do you know what time the posters were torn down?
This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.  I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences.  You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand.
My mother's buying me a new car for college.
Yes?
Doing what?
Well, I... I... that's very nice of you.
That little bitch made a fool of us I want her out of the election. Getting everybody all riled up like that.  She's finished, you hear me? Washed up.
Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  That's not what student government's about.
Uh, Jim?
Walt needs to see you.
So... what do you have to tell me?
I'm the one.  I did it.  I tore down Paul's posters.
Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word.
More this way.
Shall we give it a name?
Hey Yeah?
Sherry... I love you.
Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
Paul, I know you've been pretty down since your accident.
Who, me?  Nooo.  I never... I don't know anything about that stuff, Mr. M. Besides, that's Tracy Flick's thing. She's always working so hard and --
Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard.
Okay, let's say
For what?
We still have some extra ones, don't we?  Maybe we can just --
Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over.
Yes, Paul?
Don't you fucking knock?
How's the left these days?
Can I get you a drink?
It's Lynn.
I remember you from Christmas Eve.  You have a thing for helping women, don't you, Officer White?
There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
Do you enjoy it?
He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
We talked.
Call me Dudley.
Yeah, I hate them.
What's going to happen to Stensland?  He'll give himself cirrhosis over this.  <u>He's one</u> <u>year from his pension</u>.
It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell?
<u>What do you want</u>?
That's him.  That's him.
Where are we going?
Why?
What?
It's a suicide note.  Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running.
You wanted to meet here?
I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?
Richard Stensland.
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
What do you want, <u>officer</u>?
More.
Anything?
So on active duty, Meeks didn't make an arrest from 1938 to '43.
You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department?
Yes, I do, sir.
We got a call earlier on three Negro youths.  Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a late-model purple Mercury Coupe.
A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides.
And now you'll provide them.
<u>No</u>.
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.
Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?
Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb after all.
I'll take your word for it.
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
You, me and White, huh?
Where will you go?
Right now, before I back down.
Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
Okay!  You're right!  Dudley's got photos of me and Reynolds.
We did a piece last year. 'Ingenue Dykes In Hollywood.'  Her name got mentioned.
Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke.
What's wrong, Trash?
Yeah.  Sergeant Jack Vincennes requesting.  I need the home address on a Pierce Patchett.
You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.
Um...who's that?
I'll come straight there.
One of many people who would live a word with you.
Yes.
What <u>is</u> that?
Why don't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want?
I don't know <u>anything</u>.
I was worried about my hundred and twenty 'K'.
Did you call anyone?
That is one ugly sunrise.
It really is.  Did you find anything?
Yeah.
The NSA killed him.
Jesus. Do you have proof?
In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building.
You sure?
You're driving.
No he won't.
Listen to you, "directly". You're not gonna get <u>near</u> the News Department. And if you did, it'd never get on the air. Time-Life buried the Zapruder film for 15 years.
What if--
Baudmore Consultants.
Is it okay?
You'd like to buy your wife some lingerie as a Christmas gift.
Remain calm.
Well, I need to find out as much about Daniel as possible.
Oh...yeah, I didn't see the accident.
You tell me.
Because I don't know.
I'm just trying to determine if Mr. Zavitz was involved in something more than a simple bus accident.
We'd appreciate your cooperation.
Why'd you go to Harrison's?
<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
Right.
The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like he wanted to tell me...  ...he was upset about something and he said...  Doesn't matter now.  I'm gonna wash up.
Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
It's not true.
Stacy, don't hang up.
I know, but listen--
No, I was with her yesterday. I want you to take Eric and go to our parents house. I want you to do it right now.
What happened to your head?
Well...yeah.
Maybe it's not connected yet.
That ain't me.
That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
Yes.
Someone with whom you don't have quite so personal a--
I <u>like</u> our history. And I like you. I'd probably like <u>Brill</u> if I ever got to--
How can I be sure.
We're screwed.
I'm gonna fix it.
You have to.
Fuck you. When you needed information, I got it. You didn't care how.
You're a moron, you know that?
We'd like to ask you some questions about Daniel Zavitz.
Jesus! What?! You want money?!
Seat 74.
Who would do that?
She can't talk to you right now.
Really?
No.
You've got a bunch of Armani suits, they didn't take 'em?
They didn't take the jewelry. They took the computers. They took the big-screen TV, they took my blender.
The Congressman's very happy to have your support, but he's heard that there's an investigation.
Bobby--
I don't know!
Listen to me.
To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what they're after. Make a deal.
You remember Daniel Zavitz?
What does that have to do with you?
Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside Greenland.
If they've looked at the video.
Found him. Kent Island nailed the call five minutes ago. He's stationary.
Federal Express?
How'd you get in the building?
Thank you.
I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
I don't care to bargain.
I don't believe that.  I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?
I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this.  I apologize if I appear abrupt.  I am rusty at social graces.  How do you find Cairo?  Did you visit the Pyramids?
As the wife of one of our party.
What do you mean, poetry?
I do not.
Water?  Yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all cowardly, extremely practical.  Come on, come on!  There's also a plant - I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid.
No.
Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
It's beautiful.  What's it about?
That day, had you followed me to the market?
Don't talk.
Yes.  Absolutely.
It's Geoffrey under this.
You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
And where are the Expedition Maps?
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow.  I'm going to do what I can, but…  And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so.
We didn't care about countries. Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.  None of that mattered, did it?  It was something finer than that.
No.
I could help you.  I could get you off that.
Ask him.
I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know.  It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.
Hello.
Oh, all over.
First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
Thought you'd never wake up!
Me?
I'm fine.  I got hot.
Right.
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
Marvelous plane.  Did you look?
Apprentices.
To arm-twisting.
Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
Oh - I've found plums.  We have plums in the orchard.  We have an orchard! She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.
I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.
Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the Oasis of Little Birds.  As me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room.  I can smell it.  The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth.  I can taste it. I'm chewing the mint.  Is there sand in my eyes?  Are you cleaning sand from my ears?
Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
This is Captain McGann.
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
That's a different dress.
I'm not sewing anything else.
No!
Excuse me.  Yes?  I don't have the key to that door.
I've met you before.
So I follow the wires?
What is this business with you and explosives?  Do you think you're immune?
I'm not scared.  So many people have died around me.  But I would be a shame for us.  I don't feel like being shy.
It's what I've learned.
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
It's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean literally.
And what if he really is a spy?
Why Picton?
Only we have to go to work.
Does he have to go?
Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher -
I looked up to you, Uncle.  My brother always said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them.
You tell me.  I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France.
Why didn't I think of that?
How close?
Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you.
Who am I?
Why are we speaking Chinese?
Mr. MacDougal.
You have a car?
Uh, yes.
I don't care about the damned car. My luggage's been stolen.
I've got something...
And I thought we were getting on so well.
That old pirate Chiang Kai Shek personally took this to Taiwan when he was run out of China in 1949. Peking would dearly love to have this back...
It's a test.
How much am I paying?
He says they turned the card down.
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
Lose something?
We're doing this together. We're partners.
Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
Why don't we take oxygen?
So how long to pop the floor?
You bought this for me?
You're nervous again.
I had a lifeline. If I've got a lifeline, I'm okay.
Camera in the--
Bookshelf. Sensors--
Be careful not to break the laser beams.
You're playing both sides of the street. You're going to keep the Mask and turn me in.
STOP! You're making...mistake.
Hmmm...44 long.
Transfer.
And the money goes--
Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it.
A parting gift from the Empire.
There's always a surprise.
That was a lifetime ago.
But would you--would you--
That's because you grew up rich.
Come on.
Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
Let me ask you, this Mask, when they made it--was the old bitch dead or alive?
So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me.
You damn well thought wrong.
This is just show and tell.
You better be keeping your mind on business. It's not just me you got to worry about. I've got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder.
Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.
Call it an expression of trust.
What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
Um, Erin?  Listen.  Even though you're not necessarily my favorite person in the world ...  ... sometimes you're not half-bad.
Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
Which one?
So you say.
He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
Jesus.
You're a lawyer?
What's chromium?
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
I can put them in a good school.
I told you the questions might get a little personal --
Okay -- let's try and settle down here.
Out to lunch with the girls.
I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.
At least they made an offer.
How many families we talking about here?
You think there's more?
You wanna talk about --
They skipped that step.
No shit.
Erin -- lemme tell you something.  If I'da put three researchers on this, I wouldn't expect them to dig up all the information you got here.  This is some damn good work.
No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, I didn't have time to check those things --
What kind of things come up?
So what are you thinking?
Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...
Erin, it's just a meeting.
I did.  Both.
Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
Oh, okay.  Here it comes.
What is that?
Did he say why?
I wish I knew.  It's for my boss.  He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places.  The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself.  Would that be okay?
Nope.  Maiden.
Every county has one.  They keep records of anything water-related within their jurisdiction.  You should be able to find something there.
I hate it too.  I hate this trip.
Hey -- those are my files --
Erin.  You don't even have phone numbers for some of them.
I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.
Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
Thanks for reminding me.
You're not nothing, Erin.
That's Ed.
That is not what I'm --
About this.
What time is it?
No, I need my car --
Jaguar's a darn pretty car.
What?
I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.
It'll be fine, yeah.
Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
Next week.
Dr. Paulsen?
I gotta say, Erin -- first time I saw you, I did not peg you as the kind to go off and conduct her own epidemiological study.
It was .... the Emperor ....
Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
Yes, My Lord.
He can do it.
Will he finish what he begins?
I can't ...
Turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.
Barks and growls at his boss.
Barks his concern.
I don't care.  It would've been worth it .... for Han.
Patience.  It's time to eat.
Because of my father, I guess.
I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.
Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
What is thy bidding, My Master?
You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
Captain Solo, sir. Might I have a word with you?
If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.
You, too, golden rod.
Yes, Your Highness?
We?
Yes.
You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.
That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
What is it?
Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
Don't count on it.  I happen to like nice men.
There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.
Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.
A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.
Has Threepio turned up yet?
I was worried about you.
Are you kidding?
Very noble.  Not smart, but noble.
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
What'd you say?
Have they analyzed the one that was killed?
A tremor!
Artoo, you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ...
I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.
I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
Okay.  I'll give it a try.
I thought those seekers were set for stun!
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force.  A servant of evil it is.  Into it you must go.
Free your mind and return he will.
Will they die?
And sacrifice Han and Leia?
There is much Obi-wan did not tell you.  Come, The Emperor will complete your training.
All too easy.  Perhaps you are not as strong as The Emperor thought.
And we can watch ...
May I say something personal?
The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an undercover cop. She injected you with incentive toxin. Right now it's swimming in your bloodstream. It'll start to take effect in 9 hours.
He doesn't look like his picture.  I bet he's fake.
Where is he?
Give it to me.
Wait a minute. I know that voice.  You're Carjack Malone.
Get this crap out of me.
So what does this thing do?
Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there.  Once you go inside, you're on your own.  You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
No way.
I said pull over.
Where are they going?
Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe.
Me too?
Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
This is a dead end.  You took us into a dead end!
I'm looking for somebody.
--That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility.
Thanks to God, you are alive.
These men repented before God for their evil deeds. Those who would not, met their fate at the end of my sword.  Accept the fruit of my first quest as my wedding gift.
Your deeds set an example for all other knights. For your gift, ask a gift of me.
In the great book.
What book is that?
Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.
The knights of Galys approach the camp. It would be politic...
Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
The Queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf.
If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
Why?
Who?!
You.
Me?
Yes. I would swear my love to you.
The King without his sword, the land without a king...
It is.
I'm not jealous!
You know what I want. I want the secret of true magic, how to thicken the stuff of dreams and wishes with the flesh of the world.
I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames.
Behold the sword of power, Excalibur. Before Uther, it belonged to Lud, before Lud, to Beowulf, before Beowulf to Baldur the Good, before Baldur to Thor himself and that was when the world was young and there were more than seven colors in the rainbow.  Speak the words.
And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
It might be best to have a man with experience. Maybe someone who's spent time in the foreign missions.
Here.
What did the doctor say?
I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.
Fine thank you.
Now this is for Ritalin. Ten miligrams a day.
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
So, what causes this?
Oh, I'm very sorry Father. Hi.
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
Well before the church approves an exorcism, it conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted. That takes time. In the meantime...
Thanks. Look, I'm only against the possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good.
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months, under observation in the best hospital you can find.
No.
Yes I did, I'm sorry.
What?
No I do, Captain Howdy said no.
Cause I like it.
I love you Rags. We'll have a good day yeah?
Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.
Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one.
I don't know, I just thought.
Who's in it?
I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan.
I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras.
Your mother's in here with us Karras, would you like to leave a message? I'll see that she gets it.
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
Bon Jour.
Quod nomen mihi est?
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
And let my cry come unto thee.
And also with you.
...and to redeem through your son. Who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the holy spirit, God forever and ever.
The Lord be with you.
I've seen him.
Hey, Father? You like movies?
Very much.
Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You're happy?
Shove it up your ass you faggot!
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
Do you have an appointment?
Are you a relative?
It's our goddamn car!
Give me the keys.
So?
Where are our kids? Has he got one of them in there?
They're falling out.
Five's my guess.  Maybe more. Won't know till I get in there.  Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.
Start him out on cottage cheese. If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a few minutes.  Go down like pudding through a hot pipe.
Don't worry, Mr. Baker.  We'll knock him out. He won't feel a thing.
Get your hand off me.
I thought these were lost. Where did you find ...
Frank.
Frank.  I'm here.  I always get here.  Don't sweat it.
Lotta water.
Jack...
Fuck him.
She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that?
You got weird kids, Frank.
Trust me, you're not missing anything.
Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?
We gotta go, Jack.
I made her nervous.
Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
If you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, I'd be glad --
Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack.
Thirty-seven.  Thirty-seven.
What?
How many other silent partners are there, Frank? Donna?  Little Cindy? Hell, let's give Eddie a vote.
What's the matter?
I suppose we can bring it down a little.
Get out of here.
Sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee.
Better take care of your fingers, little brother. Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't be able to play 'Chopsticks.'
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
So what do you think?
You want to come out to the house tomorrow? The way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided to really lay it on.  Turkey, stuffing, the whole bit.  Kitchen's so full of food you can hardly move.  We could use another appetite.
Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.
You leaving that on?
Yeah.
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano.
They stopped serving two hours ago.
Celebrating.  Join me?
February?
What?
What're you doing?
I don't know.
What?
What's happening to you, Frank?  You been kissing ass so long you're starting to like it?  You let that guy turn us into clowns tonight.  We were always small time, but we were never clowns, Frank. What's happened to your dignity?
There's not going to be a viewing. I figured with the kids and all ...
Bought it on the way over.  Clean as a nun.
Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
Daughter's.  Sweet sixteen.
You should've told us you were coming, Ma. We would've come and got you.
Spur of the moment.
Your limo's ready, Ma.
You got no right springing this on me, Frankie. It's unethical.
Oh, sorry.  I get so caught up in it sometimes.  It's scary.
My watch is broken, too.
Look, miss.  We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting here, I just had to come over.  Florence Simmons.
I sing now?
What's he talking about?
What's wrong with it?
Don't worry.  We'll take it out of your share.
Right.
We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men.
Jack, you with us?
Maybe it's legit.
You play all these places?
Virgins.
Smells like tuna number two to me.
Hey, we're connected.
Hey, will you look at that?
What do you say we send a bottle over?
Some discussion.
Terrific, boys.  Really.  Terrific.
Born and bred.
Whatcha doin' over there?
Yeah.
The name's Baker --
Is that the way it is?
Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
Every year.
Yeah, well, I wish God would go a little easy on the trumpets.
What's the matter?
What'd I say?
You were good.
You were good.
Huh?
Nervous?
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.
Listen... you want to get a drink?  I got a new place.  Or we could go to a bar ...  Well, maybe not a bar.  But I know a place uptown, if you want --
Sneak out in the morning.  Before the guy could wake up and ruin it.  Never figured I'd be on the other end of it, though.
What happened to the donut king?
My days are not the old days, genius.
Oh?
Older than me.
Hey, what do you want to do?  Grow a beard?
How'd the show go?
How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?
Drive.
I hear you're a manicurist now -- got your own business and everything.  I'm glad you've stayed clean.
You porked his wife the day he was arrested.  How could you forget that?
After that.  You promised you'd always take care of me.
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
... I was dreaming ...
How come?
You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie!  What could be more important than that?
You can't go.  You can't be anywhere near that place.
Apparently, fine.  He's coming into work.  That's the good news ...
What -- what are you doing?
What's the matter with your voice, Commander?
Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
Commander, what are you doing here?
I can't even look at you without wanting to vomit.
No -- the best part is, since it's a government job -- they can't fire you!  But how can you be sure you'll get the appointment?
You've made us look pretty good in the past week.  And the way you handled the press --
What's that?
I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?
No.  Most of them are in transit by now.  I'm heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security.
Jon, it's the tenth.  I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
You too?  This holiday's about giving, Adelle.  And I'm giving everything I've got to this deal, so in a way, I'm more Christmassy than anyone...  Lifesaver?
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
That’s right. And auto supply...
And I know people.
...that’s our war room. We did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile.
Damn...
She wants to have an affair with me.
Look, maybe I’m not as good a consigliere as you are but you have to trust me on this one.  A little flirtation’s harmless but you’re playing with fire here.  The Fidelity Bank and Trust is a tough creditor.  You make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account forever.
It’s me, Jack...
What the hell are you talking about?  What’s he talking about?
Like I said, it's a business deal...
So you're telling me, you've got a gun to your head and you don't think for one second, what if this, what if that, maybe I shouldn't do this, I shoulda done that.
I mean there must be programs out there, opportunities...
Yeah?  What do you need?
You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
It’s lovely...
Frank.  Where’s Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
What are you talking about?  It’s me, Jack Campbell.  Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!
Go. I’m sorry, you should just go...
What are you doing?
You’re kidding me...
Jack.  I said the kids are asleep...
Shouldn’t we grab some dinner first?  Maybe a bottle of wine...?
Thank you...
Jack...can we afford all this?
Worse, you mean...
C’mon, Jack, you think there aren’t mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell I’m doing in New Jersey...
So what’s the big surprise? You didn’t rent this place for the weekend, did you?
I don’t think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  We’ll put Annie and Josh in private schools...
Are you okay, Jack?
I promise, Jack...
Promise me again...
No...
That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
...we’re really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
Okay, I’ll take them...
Do you want me to look for the box or call the airline?
You didn’t seem to mind offering to help me on Christmas day when you were unwrapping that Prada bag I gave you.
I found it!
I mean...
I can't take this.
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
No.  I cannot take orders from that underwear model.  That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
This is your dream, Reed.  You should be the one up there.
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
Okay.  I've uh, got some questions, from Sue.  That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom...like normal...
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Oh, you remember my name do you?  You happen to remember what you <u>swore</u> to do with every breath in your body?
What the hell you smiling at?  Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?  Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
What's wrong with me?
What is this?  Where's Reed?
Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
Me like-y.
Stay right.  Left is trouble.
You're really cramping my style here.
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl...the Invisible Girl.
I'm driving.
You two need a time-out.
What are you doing --
If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
Leonard, how's the feed?
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here.  And keep it quiet.  I don't need this to hit the press.
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
For science.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
Of course.  Of course.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us <u>worse</u>, maybe even kill us.
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
They've crossed over into the Jugular Vein!
But we have no choice! We've got, to take them out!
They're in the Pulmonary Artery.
What is it?
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
As part of the Crew.
Can't remember?... What do you mean?
Yes, we'd like to get moving.
We must!
You're going out there? With those Antibodies --
Air bubbles!... Doctor --
Looks like you didn't batten it down too well.
Then how come it worked loose?
I'll try to hold it from the other side of the wall, while you push from out here. Maybe that'll do it.
That's what they pay me for.
I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
Looks like the molecular structure of proteins.
That puts us right here... Which means we can head straight for the Sub Arachnoid Cavity.
Isn't there another surgical procedure you can try?
A what?
Looks like the sea, at dawn.
Looks like quite a way to go...
Atomic fuel?
How's it look?
Well, that takes care of the valve. It was probably caused by that electric shock.
We could never fight that current it's physically impossible.
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
...Is this a fucking joke?
It certainly is, officer. Still got that smell!
Certainly -
...So maybe the best thing would be to take care of that, right here in Brainerd.
Ya find the work interesting, do ya?
Shut the fuck up or I'll throw you back in the trunk, you know.
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.
Okay.
...You-my point is, you pay the ransom- what eighty thousand bucks?  - I mean, you give us half the ransom, forty thousand, you keep half. It's like robbing Peter to play Paul, it doesn't make any -
...Who's Jean?
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
You called me twenty minutes ago and said you had it! Ready to make delivery, ya says! Come on down and get it!  And here ya are and you're wastin' my time and you're wastin' my wife's time and I'm payin' nineteen- five for this vehicle here!
Yah, ya got yer, this loaded here, this has yer independent, uh, yer slipped differential, uh, yer rack- and-pinion steering, yer alarm and radar, and I can give it to ya with a heck of a sealant, this TruCoat stuff, it'll keep the salt off -
Yah, I don't need no sealant though.
He's three now. Course, not in that picture.
Mr. Mohra?
Yah, got a front movin' in.
Well, the little guy, he was kinda funny-looking.
Can you be any more specific?
Yah.
Uh-huh.
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
They said they were goin' to the Twin Cities?
You know what a disparity is?
We're not horse-trading here, Wade, we just gotta bite the bullet on this thing.
Yah!
Okay. We'll get the money together. Don't worry about it, Jerry. Now, d'you want anyone at home, with you, until they call?
Wade's got a point there. I'll handle the call if you want, Jerry.
...How ya doin' there, Scotty?
No! We can't let anyone know about this thing! We gotta play ball with these guys - you ask Stan Grossman, he'll tell ya the same thing!
Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you about yesterday. I was just wondering -
... I'm sorry, sir?
Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!
Hon? Got the growshries.
Well, but see, I don't have 'em in front a me - why don't I just fax you over a copy -
Yah, okay, I'll have my girl send you over a copy, then.
Yah, how much money was that?
Yah!
This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC. Sir, I have not yet received those vehicle IDs you promised me.
Sure, Jerry, we're all set. Why wouldn't we be?
Okay.
Yah, you said you'd have a think about it. I understand it's a lot of money -
I know it's a lot.
Yah, well, it's a chunk, but -
Yah.
- All's I know is, ya got a problem, ya call a professional!
Well, a course they're gonna say that! But where's my protection? They got Jean here! I give these sons a bitches a million dollars, where's my guarantee they're gonna let her go.
No, Wade! They were real clear! They said they'd call tomorrow, with instructions, and it's gonna be delivered by me alone!
They want my money, they can deal with me. Otherwise I'm goin' to a professional.  He points at a briefcase.
...There's a million dollars here!
Well, I don't vouch for him.
Never heard of him. Don't vouch for him.
Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.
Yah?
Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.
Yah, woulda been cold out here.
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
You don't think he's mixed up in -
Yah. Say, Lou, ya hear the one about the guy who couldn't afford personalized plates, so he went and changed his name to J2L 4685?
No, that's okay.
Okay, ya know. Okay.
Geez! You look great!
...This is a nice place.
Yah, ya know it's the Radisson, so it's pretty good.
Yah, if you're an engineer, yah, you could do a lot worse. Of course, it's not, uh, it's nothin' like your achievement.
I'm sorry.
What'd he say?
Oh. Oh, my.
Oh. Geez.
His wife. This guy says she was kidnapped last Wednesday.
- looking.
Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving around Moose Lake.
We've got a -
Hon?
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
They're real good.
They announced it?
Three-cent stamp.
Your mallard?
Yah.
He's at Norstar.
And the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule...
That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking great! Congratulations.
It must've been Tuesday.  he was wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.
After fight club, everything else in your life gets the volume turned down.  You can deal with anything.
"Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an image.
Yes?
No.  No, sir.  I loved that condo. I loved every stick of furniture. The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were me.  The dishes were me.  The plants were...
You need to lighten up.
Sure.
I'll take the parasites.
What... ?
I think everything's okay here.
Uh ... nah.
You hear that?
Hear what?
That... sawing and hammering.
What is this?  Who did this?
What?
Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  I thought they were going to break my arm.
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
Hello?
Who's this?
I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.
Who do you think I am?
You're the one who did this to me. You're Mr. Durden, sir.  Tyler Durden.
Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
My suitcase was vibrating?
I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host to cancer or parasites; I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.
If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.  Marla...the little scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop tonguing it, but you can't.
No, supply oxygen?
I mean -- for a living.
How's that working out for you?
Huh?
Go ahead.  Say it.
I don't know about this.
How do you feel?
The fight.
If you could fight anyone... one on one, whoever you wanted, who would you fight?
My boss, probably.  Who would you fight?
Hum.
Doesn't matter.
You?
She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
Okay.
As the fat renders, the tallow floats to the surface.  Remember the crap they taught you in Boy Scouts.
This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it.
Shut up.  Our fathers were our models for God.  And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
Hey.
Something on your mind?
Should I E-mail you?  Should I put this on your "action item list?"
If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
People think that you're me, because you and I happen to share the same body.
This isn't possible...
She's... you... you're fucking her.
I can't let you...
I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you know which wires, in what order...
Yes...
Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?
Appreciate something.
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
Ain't that something?
Pleeeeeease!
We need some towels, Lou.  We need replacement light bulbs.
You have to tell us now.
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
What did you see?  What am I looking for?
Please.  It's not going to wait.
Does she have a cell phone?  A way we can contact her?
I tried calling last night but your father --
Want me to drive?
What is it?  What are you?
Your mother would have been so proud of the way you've handled yourself through all of this...
Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you runnin' away from her house.
I'll remove him.
Alright, Browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about Ms. Lewton, or what?
I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
I know what you're doing!  It's alright to be scared, Carter. You don't have to prove to us how big your balls are. Not now.
Co Phuong Bao.  The guide takes us twelve klicks upriver to target at Ban... at Ban... Bo Peep.  Shit!
Batteries not included.
Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth century.
How come we didn't just drop near the camp... save this hassle?
She likes you.  Says you're dinky- dau.
I'm getting him out.
It's orders!  You remember... when they tell you to do something and then you do it.  John Wayne is dead, man.
You better take off.
Where did you find this clown?
Nguyen.  He twelve now.  Not see him for eight years.
I do?
That's an order.
Not yet.
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
What?
POWs?  I don't know.  But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks.  Cream?
It's not necessary.
But you're right... some people do get sacrificed.  Now tell me why you pulled the plug.
Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs.
It's not over.  You made one mistake.
Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!
That depends on you.  Christ, look at you.  I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it Rambo's last stand.
Those men are all dead.
Listen up.  You two are married as of now.  Get used to it.
My parents were divorced.
I think some people are meant to be alone.  Maybe I was a man in a former life and I used women for pleasure so now I'm paying for it - which would be fine, if I could just remember some of the pleasure parts... 
That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.
This food's delicious.  You're a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home.
Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
I'm sorry.
I was attacked.
Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?
Lydia?!  Lydia who!?
I was not with a woman last night.  I was out with Parry.
He's not a moron.
What?  The curse'll be lifted?  <u>Will</u> <u>you please</u>!
Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud.
You're kidding!  What did he say?
It's so great to see you like this, honey... I can't tell you.
You want to talk?  Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
But..How could that happen?
Well, it's not unusual in his case... Sometimes victims of tragedies are subject to the brain's replay system. The brain never loses anything - it just stores it up and waits. A person could actually re-experience the full effect of a tragedy, long after the event took place. Are you relatives?  Well, it doesn't matter. We'll take care of it. He'll have to be sent back to the same institution.. 
No...no...we can't...we can't..
Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
It was a crime.
How un-sixties of you.
Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.
Oh, Lydia!
Lydia.  Lydia what?
No... thanks... Listen --
I think you're a very nice... very nice psychotic man.  I really appreciate what you did for me.  It was a very brave and noble thing...
Can I take you to lunch?
But I gave it to you!
Pretty impressive huh?...Don't let it scare you. I'll admit it's formidable but everything has it's weakness.
All right! Listen - please...don't start drooling or...rolling your eyes when I tell you this but - You shouldn't do this..There is no Holy Grail.
...You are such a great guy. First the money, now this.  Isn't he fabulous!?
Please don't hug me in public again, O.K.?
You can't do this! This is New York! Nobody lies in naked in a field in New York..It's...it's too Midwestern.
Maybe, when we get the Grail...
Parry, it's Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner.
Beautiful night huh?
Come on! Go for it! What the hell are they gonna do? They can't do nothin!
I don't like horror movies!
It sounds exciting.
We mostly publish trashy romance novels.
No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.
I never say anything I have to.
What are we about to do?
I don't drink coffee...
Oh no, I want to.  I've got a hard-on for you the size of Canada... but I don't... want just one night.  I have a confession to make?
... It's not just from tonight.  I've known you for a long time.  I see you come out of work every day.  I walk with you to lunch.  I know what you order... I see you buy Baby Ruths before going back in...  I know how you feel on certain days by whether or not you go into the bookstore...  ... I know you hate your job and you don't have many friends and you sometimes feel like you're not as... as wonderful as everybody else and you're a little uncoordinated  ... and feeling like you're the only one who's as separate and... alone as you are... and I love you.   I love you.  I think you're the greatest thing since... spice racks and I would be knocked out several times if I even got just a first kiss.  But I'll be back in the morning.  And I won't be distant.  And I will call if you let me... But I still don't drink coffee.
You said.
Cerveza.
Will you just do what the hell I tell you...
You treat me like I was.
You go slippin' around in front a my face, an' in front a Elton an' Stoney. What do you imagine they think a someone you treat that way...
If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.
Sure...
No. How much do I owe you?
But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
Oh my goodness... Bobby...
Robert Eroica...
Daddy's very ill.
Tita, I've got to go...
Look at that.
What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.
Yes, intentionally.
I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.
Tomorrow, then.
The day after tomorrow.
If you're free.
You had no inner feeling?
Is he?
Will you let me talk to you, please?
I've walked across a stage a number of times, without exciting any particular response...
I've got an extra jacket behind the seat, if you want to put it on.
I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.
Oh, my, "a summit conference." I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.
There'd never be a hole big enough. Now took at me, for instance, when I was just one person, before Bobby, I had so much garbage collectin' onto me every day, I was thinkin' about gettin a dispose all...
And you know, I read where they invented this car that runs on... that runs on... when you boil water...
There's some good things on it, though.
That's exactly what I am doing, again.
Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.
Do you have a name?
So watcha doin'?
I, umm, came to see you.
You know. I got a lot, more than one.
You got a boyfriend?
So wadda you do with your girls?
I kissed those girls.
So what girls are over there?
Eddie from Compost?
Yeah, he got a bad attitude.
Now salsa, you know how to dance salsa?
You looking for somebody?
Yo, that's my girl.
She didn't say she had no man.
You sure?
Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
Not really.
Hey!
You're kidding.
Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.
Fletch!
Hey you're really nuts.
You go back to that goddamn beach, I swear to God I'll make you regret it.
Not a prayer.
Fat Sam left the beach today. So did Gummy. It began to occur to me that some things are beginning to happen that maybe I should be aware of.
Yes.
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
Just relax....
No idea.
What, the heat here?
Affirmative.
I'm fine.
I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.
I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out.
That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
He is lifting Stanwyk's two attaché cases.
Harry S. Truman?
Isn't that nice. Since when?
Forgive me now for seeming personal, but we understand that there is a lady friend he sees here in Provo.
And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann.
John Ultramalensky, right?
God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you.
Fletch?
Maybe I'm just on vacation.
A .357.
Get me on the first shot, if you can.
They serve dinner on the flight?
Deal.
Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
Did you hear something?
'Stanwyk's parents, Marvin and Velma Stanwyk, also of Provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'
Not our kind of people, you understand.
My hero.
Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?
Cute thing.
She's cute as a button.
Oh, mine! Thank God.  Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?
It's Scotch-Rumanian.
I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
Hi.
Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there.
I think you should call me Gail, now.
I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?
What are you talking about?
Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
What is this....
And they're leaving the country tomorrow night.
I commend him on his choice.
I'm her cousin.
Just kidding, Frank. You'll have the story and you'll be damn proud of it.
You broke it? You know the source?
It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about.
It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.
You'll have it.
I'm sick of this place. I'm going to try out for the Lakers. They need a power forward.
Oh, Margie, sorry, Frieda lost the number of Alan's realtor in Provo. Can you give it to me real quick?
And, I'm sorry, who are you again?
But I ain't got you...
But I ain't got you...
Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
Actually, you may take it all now.
Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
Art Mo-o-o-ney!
Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.
Thanks for the promotion, man.
Sorry, Jazz.  After this, I'll throw a burger down your throat, okay?
A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
I wish I knew.  You did good work...
Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl.  Period.
Hmmm, the first disc was putting out an incomprehensible stream of high bits.  This one is putting out low bits.  The data is in some fucked binary system.  The two discs need to interface simultaneously with a third decryptor disc.  Comprendo?
Hah fluck, great video, huh?
This is boring, guys.
Suck a dick, I left my purse...
As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'
Hoh graphic!  I'm going to dream of ears for a year!  Ugh!
Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk.  Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.
You think you're so hot just because you can get into any club. You think you're so hot, just because you have sex with great- looking women.  You think you're so hot just because you broke the Ensenada tape piracy ring...
I was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'
The case!
How's it going?
Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection.  I'm Julian Grendel.
So what did you think of the ballet? Was it like a warm Ice Capades?
When I say 'no,' run for the door.
'Bye, Johnny...
Did I say you could move that hand -- I'm not gonna get stuck am I?
Takin' care o' business, honey.
I don't know where I'm gonna find a pizza joint open.
Yeah?
I don't...
Did you ever sit on the edge of the bed, take off your socks and stick your fingers between your toes?
Are you having trouble raising the half million?
Regarde mon pêcheur de baleine... Tu sais il va faire très froid cet hiver.
Alain is the only man I know who can become as enthusiastic about a bridge as he can about a woman.
Des Moines.
Mr. and Mrs. Alain Charnier, would be another.  He's in shipping.
And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I don't know what he does.
What about you, Doyle?  Who's the best fighter you ever seen?
What ya doin' out so late?  Hidin' from the cops?
Yeah!
What the hell am I drivin' for? I'm a first grade Detective. You're a second grade guinea.
I'm goin' check on this address in the Bronx, if you're bullshitting me, it's your ass.
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
This is what the tough guys are wearin'.  You know I only steal from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.
Yeah.
Sexual assault, Daryl.  Five years.  But you got lucky, right?  You got away with something else.  Something you figured nobody knows about.
Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?
You got a collar in here for the Nightingale murders?
That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
Frank.  We gotta go back.  Frank...
Frank.  Hey, man.  You alright?
It looks open on the other side.
Don't know what's behind it.
What's the matter, Jules?  Trouble workin' an eight hour shift, watching the kid and whipping up a little bolognese?
Did he?
Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight.
You give him his drops?
I love you, Bud.
I'm serious.
Then you gotta hide it somewhere. Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it...for 29 years!  Put it under the loose floorboard by the window!
What do you mean?
What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0.  And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball.
Frank, please...
Frank, this is insane...
Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised.
You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series...live?
What?
I don't know.
It's really you, isn't it?
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
I never knew you, Dad.
Dad, you there?  You okay?
What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
Dad, I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard.
How?
John, you there?
Huh?
I better give you my address then.
Don't choke on your pride, Sull.  You ain't ever gonna catch another one like that.
He ain't our guy, John.
Hi, this is Julia.  Please leave a message after the tone.
Sounds good.
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
So how'd you like LION KING?
My six year-old here keeps telling me he wants to be a policeman.  Right after he retires from the majors.  We just gave him a badge and a whistle for his birthday.
Wife around?
No kiddin'?
Sullivan?
Who brought up this bright idea?
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
Cool it, Andy.
That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
What's the matter?!
You're irresistible.  I lose control.
Somebody was in here.
And, what about us?
My whole world.
Faster!  Eat faster!
Please... be cool.
I don't see anything.
You don't "have to."
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
...And I said, shut up!
Daddy, what is going on?
What?
They did show up.  Isn't that great?
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
Are they grown-ups?
But what if they try and scare us?
It's just that Darren and Lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.
Which is?
Huh?  Oh, come on, Sis.  I'm tellin' ya, we can't play Clue with just two people.
-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
In the media, you've frequently been described as "salty" --
I'm here.
I know everything about you, Diana.
Sorry, Di.  I was just going to my car.  I didn't mean to frighten you...
She's your lady only cause she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.
That's very colorful, chief.
Her name's Stephanie.
Steven, c'mon, we're not thirteen...
Oh, my dear God...
The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
About what?
She's a waitress at Joey B's but she needs some extra cash.  Ward's the pimp.
Have you seen Tamara?
I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.
A major prick.
You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
But I thought...
Where's the radio?
Did you find Rennie?
He's doing the best he can, Charles.
Everyone split up -- we'll cover more ground that way.
You're making a big mistake, Rennie. It's not too late to put you back on land.
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
She didn't push me into coming.
You had me worried to death!
I don't know what to say...
It's okay...you're going to be okay.
What do you mean, we must abandon?
Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
I never left the garage without my Windex.
Under the Manhattan Bridge.
Guys ready to order?
How is Lillian? I haven't seen her.
You will suffer because he is in the theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears.
That's awful.
In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.
We were thinking of putting in a pool.
What?
What?
I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?
I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?
Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me?
I'm willing to tell you my name.
I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.
What else?
Who the hell cares?
A thousand things.
I'm at the door.
Where the hell are you?
You know the answer to that.
They're only gonna lose.
Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?
Remember 1949? Last two games of the season. Against the Yankees. The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they lost on Sunday. First I cried for twenty-four hours. Then I had fist- fights the rest of the week.
Where's your elastic brace?
I lost it. I lose everything.
You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.
You're charming the boy.
Life is good.
They're my team.
Finally, I get a waiter who doesn't know "Macbeth".
Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer.
Yes, Peter.
Yes.
I kissed her while she was laughing.
There was a review.
I hear good things about the new play.
Do you think he can do it?
He's a very sweet man.
Yes.
You've come to me. I wanted to believe you would one day.
Oww!
You're a clergyman.
That's the sort of thing you'll be seeking on this "farm"...
What are you doing?
If I want to be one with them, I have to live like them.
And Jinnah?
He's waiting. He's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think.
What do you want?
It has. But you'd be surprised. They understand -- they really do. It's not the workers you have to worry about.
It is foolish if it is just to save the life of an old man.
We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi.
You mean a general strike?
You mean you employ Mr. Baker as your attorney, but you can't walk down the street with him?
Well, then, it must be fought. We are children of God like everyone else.
Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.
Have you read his magazine?
In Calcutta it's like civil war. The Muslims rose and there was a bloodbath, and now the Hindus are taking revenge -- and if we can't stop it there'll be no hope for the Hindus left in Pakistan.
You didn't beat me that day.  I beat <i>myself</i>.
How are you doing this, Vincent?  How have you done <i>any</i> of this?
Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed child?
I'm sorry, there's no way we can.
So you've finally seen sense and come back to your old job, Vincent.
No?  What's keeping you?
I guess so.  Well, while you're up there, maybe you could tidy the place up a bit.
We're already getting complaints about frivolous search.
The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant. The employees are all accounted for.
None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
From what budget?
Where do we start?
One look through there and you would know why I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further.
Don't be deceived, Irene.  These are just the clothes.  He has to wear them. Something I could never do.
I think I'd better choose the menu.  After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be <i>you</i>.
How long do you stay up there before you go?
So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled.
You <i>are</i> a catch.  No doubt she's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to "breed up".  What's wrong with her?
Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.
Antonio, the choir...
My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
You worried about the cost?
Not that.
I was at home.
Why don't we say we were together?
Why would we do that?
What exactly is wrong?
What <i>is</i> this place?
What's this, Lamar?
You're back with your own people now. Got you some professionals.
Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson...
That's your problem.
You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
What do you add up to here?
One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million.
A little more was taken out before.  My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts.
Hello, Doc.
I've been doing my homework.
Fatter... some things never change.
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
I guess I'm kind of...
Why are you laughing?
I didn't. I just waited.
If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
I mean it.
I don't want to go there.
When I got out, why didn't you tell me where it was?
A man helped me open it...
What do you want to do?
You can't trust anything these days.
Where are you going?
Are you hungry?
I don't want to hear it.
We got this far.
Okay.
You and me.
Are we going to make it?
Where's home?
You were with him?
I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?
And I keep my mouth shut?
You're going to have to walk back to the border.
I don't think you have to worry much about Harold. He won't do anything.
Can he trust you?
Collar bone is broken. No infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day.
Hello, Jack,  I don't know anything, Jack.
When did you find out?
Do you want to be dead, Albert?
You knew what I'd do.
What's it got to do with you?
Bloody well tell me who sent you.
Jack, you're wrong.
Train goes at four minutes past twelve. You've just got time.
Who sent you, Thorpey?
Though nicer than most?
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
What was bugging Frank?
Do you?
Really?
While he was here. You went about together?
Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!
Then he must have pulled her.
That's what I was wondering.
Why would it?
Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.
Stuff it! My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight.  Nice surprise, isn't it?
I'm staying with a friend.
I'll call the police.
Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
Now just a minute...
What about Keith?
So shut up.
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
Scotch, please.
Oh... I think I'll stay as I am.
You're bluffing, you bastard!
I'm not?
What?
The whole fuckin' thing...The pressure's just too great.  You're ab...you're absolu...they're too important.  All of them.  You go in the door.  I..."I got to close this fucker, or I don't eat lunch," "or I don't win the Cadillac..." We fuckin' work too hard.  You work too hard.  We all, I remember when we were at Platt...huh?  Glen Ross Farms... didn't we sell a bunch of that..."
We're stuck with this...
It's too...
Eh?
It's too...
It's not.
And it's not right to the customers.
I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years.
...that's right...
And so they kill the goose.  I, I, I'll...and a fuckin' man, worked all his life has got to...
That's thinking.  Now, he's got the leads, he goes in business for himself.  He's...that's what I... that's thinking! "Who?  Who's got a steady job, a couple bucks nobody's touched, who?"
That's right...
When they...
What?
Somebody...
Graff?  Because I worked for him.
Yes.  I mean are you actually talking about this, or are we just...
We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.
Did I say that?
What did he say?
What?  What?  The leads.
What if you don't get caught?
They come to you, you going to turn me in?
You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you.  Answer me. They come to you.  You going to turn me in?
Yes.  I'm sure.
...they take me, then.  They're going to ask me who were my accomplices.
So I'm making it concrete.
I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You mean the board...?
I can't close 'em.
Huh?
You think they're going to catch... where are you going?
Why? 'Cause they aren't going to find the guy.
Yes.
They're inured to it.
I, um, and may...maybe they're in... they're in...you should, John, if we're ins...
...Come in here...I work here, I don't come in here to be mistreated...
Go to lunch, George.
Who told me wh...?  You've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...?  You've got a board-up on the window...Moss told me.
Listen to me, the statute, it's for your protection.  I have no complaints with that, in fact, I was a member of the board when we drafted it, so quite the opposite. It says that you can change your mind three working days from the time the deal is closed.
Hey, fella, let's get this done...
Hey, hey, hey, easy friend.  That's the "Machine." That is Shelly "The Machine" Lev...
...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that?  What is that...?
You know what those leads cost?
...ah, fuck this...
The...Shelly?  The hot leads are assigned according to the board.  During the contest. Period.  Anyone who beats fifty per...
Either way.  You're out.
I will close.
Not lately you can't...
Why?
Is that what you're saying?
That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I'd like something off the other list.  Which, very least, that I'm entitled to.  If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am.  What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you.
That's alright.
Ah, fuck.  Leads!  Leads! Williamson!  Send me out!  Send me out!
That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.
You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.
Mmm.
Well, I'm saying this, Shel: usually I take the contracts to the bank.  Last night I didn't.  How did you know that?  One night in a year I left a contract on my desk. Nobody knew that but you.  Now how did you know that?  You want to talk to me, you want to talk to someone else...because this is my job.  This is my job on the line, and you are going to talk to me.  Now how did you know that contract was on my desk?
I sold them to Jerry Graff.
How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?
No, I think I don't want your money. I think you fucked up my office. And I think you're going away.
Hey, they're fuckin' garbage any case...This whole goddamn...
Dave...
Shelly...!
Williamson, get on the phone, call Mitch...
You closed 'em today?
What is it?
Oh!  For the magazine...
No, his wife is.
Oh!  My God...I've got to get you on the plane!
...all train compartments smell vaguely of shit.  It gets so you don't mind it.  That's the worst thing that I can confess.  You know how long it took me to get there? A long time.  When you die you're going to regret the things you don't do.  You think you're queer...? I'm going to tell you something: we're all queer.  You think that you're a thief?  So what?  You get befuddled by a middle-class morality...?  Get shut of it.  Shut it out.  You cheated on your wife...?  You did it, live with it.  You fuck little girls, so be it. There's an absolute morality?  May be.  And then what?  If you think there is, then be that thing.  Bad people go to hell?  I don't think so.  If you think that, act that way.  A hell exists on earth?  Yes. I won't live in it.  That's me. You ever take a dump made you feel you'd just slept for twelve hours...?
Or a piss...?  A great meal fades in reflection.  Everything else gains.  You know why? 'Cause it's only food.  This shit we eat, it keeps us going.  But it's only food. The great fucks that you may have had.  What do you remember about them?
Lingk.  James Lingk.
Jim, Jim, you saw my book...I can't, you saw my book...
Three business days.  They mean three business days.
I don't know.
The check wasn't cashed?
We're going to speak to her.
She told me I have to.
I...
It's nothing.
You just this morning...
I'm going home.
They didn't get my contracts.
To the restaura...what do you fucking...?
With what?  With what, John, they took the leads...
Did you like your party?
I got lots of presents.
Do you like them?
On your pillow.
We have no money for a rug.
I want to talk to you, Michael.
Honey!  Wait a minute; let's go for a drive.
I just had a drive; besides, I want to see my brother-in-law Michael.
I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
 My two friends have my share of the money.  I'll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler.
Get a good night's sleep.  We got a new suit, new shirt, new tie, and I'm going to shave you myself. Tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow Americans.
Why'd you do it, Frankie?  After all these years, why'd you turn against him?
Gee, Frankie, it's good to see you. Reminds me of old times.
Great, Havana's great.  Lots of activity in Havana!  Anybody I know here.  Five-Angels?  Anybody?
It was hard to have him killed.
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
It's the way Pop wanted it.
Beautiful.
I bet you can't guess what happened?
What?
No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?
... He said he had shot his Grandfather with a gun, and then he died in the garden.  And he asked me... he asked me, Tom, if that meant now his father would shoot him out of... revenge.  How does a four year old boy learn the word... 'revenge'?
If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.
Where's my brother?
I want you to reach Fredo.  I know he's scared, but have one of our people reach him.  Assure him that there will be no reprisals.  Tell him that I know Roth misled him.
They can come in now.
He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be met by the Internal Revenue; the Customs Service, and half the FBI.
I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down.  Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer.
Good.  Then you're staying.
What's up?
The High Court of Israel turned down his request to live as a 'returned Jew.' His passport's been invalidated except for return to the U.S.  He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday, offered a gift of one million dollars if they would give him citizenship.  They turned him down.
He's ten times tougher than me, my brother.  He's old-fashioned.
Frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history.  I remember you talking about Hitler back in '43.  We were young then.
Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity.  He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record.
Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand?
I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.
Are you Klingman?
I represent the interests of the Corleone family.  We make the invitation to you to tie up your affairs and be out of the hotel by Monday morning.
Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
Very impressive.
It occurred to me: the police are paid to fight, and the Rebels are not.
Says who?
Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.
Michael, yes, we was all relieved...
I know.
Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle.
And?
Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs.
What's this?
No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened.  It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you.
I'm not a kid.
Yeah, I'm a good man.  Something make you think I'm not?
No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
Something I can do for you?
You're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo.
You did not know?
There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
What?  Oh yes.
Yeah?  What were some of your movies?
I apologize for going on like this. It's the Sunday painter in me.  Of course I can understand your refusal.  It's a great deal to ask of someone.
But it's just my face you want to draw.
Take a picture, it lasts longer.
Saw your movie the other night. Watched it with some friends.
Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.
It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of.
Quite true.  Hand-to-hand combat is the true test.  Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand?
No.  I could have, though.
I'll pay our going rate.  Plus what you'd get if you did the hedges.
Just a trim.  And mine while you're at it.  Fingers are a bit stiff today.
You don't think of me that way, do you?
It will only make you self-conscious.  You'll have to remove your shirt.
Oh dear.  I <u>have</u> made you nervous.
I'm fine.  I'd just rather keep it on.
But I chose freedom.  David was still in the thick of it, his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue.  I didn't fancy spending my golden years as merely "the friend."  The dirty little secret of a nervous producer.
Not fear.  More like disgust.
My apologies.  I had no business snapping at you.
It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.
No.  The girl.
Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
Oh, of course.  Clayton.  You finished your shower already?
"A perfect night for mystery and horror.  The air itself is filled with monsters."
I don't know.
What was that?
Just take off the fucking mask!
Break my neck.  Or strangle me.  It would be oh so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me.  Please, Clayton. We've come this far.
I'm up.  Thanks.
She tells me you haven't been sleeping well.
Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
Yes, yes, Dr. Payne.  But from the neck up?  What's my story there?
Bring a mirror.  Let the Bride feast upon her visage.
Perfectly all right.  But if you'd like to sit --
There is iced tea, Hanna?  Cucumber sandwiches?
I do not think you anything anymore.  Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys.
Sure.
Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.
Of course.
My idea.  Muchly.  My sketches. Big heavy brow.  Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.
Oh dear.  Have I made a blunder?
Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you -
And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. You know why? All they eat is seafood.
I do a poaching number. Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn wedding. Plain but flavorful. And it's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce ...
Jesus, man ... What'd you do?
My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require the best. I insist on the best. I only engage the best.  Your brother. His friends. They came to me. They wanted my paper. He was your brother. You were the best. Now. They've brought so much goddamn heat down, I may not be able to fill this order. Which would be very bad for me. Which in turn, is very bad for them...
Get out --
You have my word...
I know you.
It's funny. There's probably been five more cars stolen in the time I've been here ...
I know you.
Where you been, anyway?
okay ...
What's the matter?
Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time ...
Forget that ...
The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia --
I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?
I remember. Supper getting cold, cos you two are out there heads under hoods ...
It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx...
You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?
Yeah ...
You're kind of cultivating a new look.
C'mon, man... My "demise..."  Overreaction
You don't think so, huh?
I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...
You spread it out ... you move around... So's they can't touch you... so's they don't know... Shadow games and shit ...
You okay -- ?
I dunno. Whatever will be will be...
Sure, man --
See you're still stealing the sailors from the sea --
"Mitch?"
And you got some Italians -- ?
What the hell are you doing -- ?
Right. Great car. One of a kind. I was looking forward to that boost myself
No ... ?
Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me, Randall. I'm the jane that was left, and you're the jim that did the leaving. So save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes. The only reason I ride with you, is cause I don't want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps!
What the hell's that -- ?
Unlock your button ...
Of course you are. You're a professional...
You think it can be done?
The hard part ...
The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
Split it up. Any word on Donny?
Hey, Memphis. Remember me? Toby Walker. I live next door ...
Who's "Eleanor?"
Not really -
Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.
The guy from near where Christie used to live?
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
Nods again.
Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.
I didn't know, I swear.  I thought it was next week.
Talk? To you? After what you did!
What are you talking about?
Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke.  I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me?
Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.
What happened? You okay?
It's still better than letting somebody find him.
Watch this.
Nah.
What fucking good are these things? They don't fit. What do I need this for? I'm not paying for this shit.
I can't eat,  just get me some coffee.
How?
And Jimmy's in it, right?
I want to talk to Jimmy.
I can't make any more deliveries.
What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.
Batts's made. His whole crew is going to be looking for him. This is fucking bad.
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.
I don't want them left back.
But I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of things. Paulie.  You know me all my life.  I've always done the right thing.
What? Come on!
Who's she talking to?
Submit, bitch! Submit! Submit!
Casey's bouncin' at a bar up Harvard. We should go there sometime.
I don't know, we'll fuck up some smart kids.  You'd prob'ly fit right in.
What do we got?
Thanks, Chuck.
She went to Medical school in California.
Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.
You're kiddin' me.
I'm glad you came by, changed my opinion of Harvard people.
I don't care what his family's like or if he doesn't have any brothers, but he doesn't have to lie to me.
So why don't you give me my sandwhich?
Come on, Will...
You got fired from pushing a broom, you little bitch.
Why don't you beat off at your house?
What'd you say about me?
Me and Bill scraped together the parts, worked on it. Morgan was out panhandlin' every day.
I have about seventy-three...
History.
Good, it was all right.
Okay, you're in your bed, Will. Now how old are you?
I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
Really?
Shall we start the, uh...
That's fine, but did you ever think--
Will, on your own time, you can do what you like. When I set up a meeting, with my associates, and you don't show up it reflects poorly on me.
--You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
You know, you're no longer required to come here.
It's Saturday.
Find out what?
Good to see you.
This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him.
Yeah.
Would you excuse us?
Just...take it easy, Gerry.
--No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy--
--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
Oh, that's nice--
--Yes you are, Sean. You resent me. And I'm not going to apologize for any success that I've had.
That's right! You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! So don't blame me for how your life turned out. It's not my fault.
I don't blame you! It's not about that! It's about the boy! 'Cause he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him-- I won't see you make him feel like a failure too!
If you push him into something, if you ride him--
You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself!
What's the point?
There is somebody...
There goes that fuckin' Barney right now, with his fuckin' "skiin' trip." We should'a kicked that dude's ass.
No, but, I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about.
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
Maybe you married the wrong woman.
Why thank you.
Yeah? You got a lady now?
How'd it go?
I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun...
I teach this shit, I didn't say I knew how to do it.
Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife?
Do you think you're alone?
Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.
I been there. I played my hand.
Look, a lot of that stuff goes back a long way.  And it's between me and him and it has nothing to do with you.
I know.
Yeah, I think so.
Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
I've been sitting over there for forty- five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me. But I'm just tired now and I have to go home and I wasn't going to keep sitting there waiting for you.
I kind of got that impression.
I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description.
No...I was hoping to get a kiss.
How many?
Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another crack at it. Let me take you out.
I couldn't wait till tomorrow.
I've never seen your place.
Sometime. I don't know. Next week.
Fine.
I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart.
Yeah, but how do you know?
You doin' the hirin'?
Leave him alone, Ma--Al's just billy- goatin' around--
We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.
Well, you said anybody can waltz... How'm *I* doin'?
You're *ticklin' me!*
Naw. They paroled me.
People done it. If they could, we could.
Any gas?
Banana cream, pineapple cream, chocolate cream--and apple.
Four.
Can all of you work?
Got a warrant?
We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
Say, who runs this place?
Anything like work aroun' here?
Can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.
That cut you got?
Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.
What you figger to do?
Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?
They won't. They're a-gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else.
Fella named Spencer sent us--said they was work pickin' peaches.
I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick or a sledge--that shines up your hands. I notice little things like that all the time.  Got a trade?
You people got a lotta nerve.
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.
Workin'. Pickin' peaches. But I seen a bunch a fellas yellin' when we come in, so I come out to see what's goin' on. What's it all about?
Didn' you have no breakfast?
Well, you just turn around and walk the other way.
Well, can't nobody get through nine *months* without sorrow.
No'm.
Ma... you know, if Connie was here I wouldn't min' any a this.
Glad to get shet of him. Never was no good an' never will be--
That!
Muley tol' me what happened, Ma. Are we goin' to California true?
Wait. There's a half a bottle a soothin' sirup here.  It put the chillun to sleep.
When?
You promised, Tommy.
Got any more, Ma?
They know he got hit in the face.
That Casy. He might a been a preacher, but--he seen a lot a things clear. He was like a lantern--he helped mw see things too.
She's gettin' prettier, Ma.
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
Good-by, Tom. Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? You'll try to fin' us?
Whyn't you buy a san'wich? We got nice san'widges.
You can have this for ten cents.
Which ones?
Oh, them? Well, no--them's *two* for a penny.
They gone.
Are you crazy?
Who's the Shawnee Land and Cattle Comp'ny?
Then who *do* we shoot?
Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that.
I figger best we leave something like this on him, lest somebody dig him up and make out he been kilt.  Lotta times looks like the gov'ment got more interest in a dead man than a live one.
We gonna stay, ain't we?
Whatta you think you're talkin' about? I got a han'bill here says good wages, an' I seen it in the papers they need pickers!
I never knowed it! All I done was pull that string!
We can pick anything.
Yes, sir.
But wait. I still don't understand what you do.
You do not.
You're so funny...
So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again?
What do you want to do?
I just play my own collection.
How long has it been?
What's your business?
You see someone?
Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.
You look beautiful.
...Let me get my coat.
He was trying to kill you, right!
No.
You don't understand...
How do you know?
We're both professionals, Oatman.
I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens."  So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families.
Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you've killed.
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.
What stuff?
I work alone.
No.
I been looking at you, and I've decided that I want to share something with you.
Okay.
Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job...
Have you seen Debi Newberry?
The more things change, the more they Goddamned well stay the same.
You always say that. You always say that. I'm telling you, you never met the man.
Lisbon?
Well?
That's strictly Bàader-Meinhof stuff.
No...
Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
And they want me to make up for it.
And sir, I also get that broken- mirror, black-cat, Friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about this one....
I liquidated the last account in Zurich, and split it into two new ones in Estonia.
Of course you will.
He gave me a great deal.
How's that?
I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
It's, uh... beautiful country. I had a little bit of a hard time finding the place. There are no signs.
What's that to miss?
I've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat.
Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...
Thanks.
You missed a button.
Then what have we been doing? I mean what was the point?
Fine!
Grace, I put it on the table near your --
I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
Do you want us to turn around and go back home? Do you?
It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers.
Don't they believe in signs here?
... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?
I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
WHAT?! How can you --  I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.
I don't deserve that. I have never looked at you as a disappointment. If I'm on your back to do better, if I push you to try harder it's because I want you to be the best you can be.
Listen, if... if there's a part of you as parent that... that takes pride in your child -- that, you can look at them and see something you've accomplished as well... if that's wrong, then I'm sorry.  But it wasn't my intention. I don't push for me. I do it for you... So you don't waste half your life feeling like you don't know where you belong.
Well, then I do apologize... But what I'm most sorry for is turning you into a spoiled brat who can only think about what she's feeling... who can't admit when she's wrong and who can't forgive when she's not.
What did you say?
Started what?
What?... Oh baby...
Sure... What's Grace up to?
Okay. We'll see you later then.
That bag's almost empty.
You can hardly get your arms around me. How depressing. You're so early.
I had to excuse myself from a meeting. It's ridiculous. I kept thinking about the baby... you... and, I swear, I was going to start bawling right into my briefs.
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
NO! What are you -- you're serious about this?
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.
Taking forever. I just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before Monday. I don't know how I'm going to do it.
Good night.
Oh well... branding will do that to you.
Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
You know, that's interesting. I always wondered when I went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a Black Angus steak. I couldn't taste any difference although I could swear one was more tender. I didn't know there was that big a difference between cows...  I've never been on a cow farm before. I must say, the bulls seem to have the best time of it. Just laying around the fields all day until they're asked to...  do their... work.
Oh, I don't know...
I'll have another round of that spaghetti if may?
Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner?
She calls him Tommy...
I'll help you with the coffee.
Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
Mixed salad.
Bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle.
They don't get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow. And they're good mother.
Yeah?
I can't...
I don't know if I can.
I know where he goes.
My parents are having friends from college over. They're really nice... They have this gorgeous son who wants to be a forest ranger.
Jude, you okay?
Have you heard from Judith's parents?
Dad! I can do it, OK?!
Did you notice -- no cane?
Oh I clear forget. You had a call from some woman in New York. She sounded pretty wound up.
Well, that'll happen.
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
Let's keep her.
Active matrix, man. A million psychedelic colors. Man, baby, sweet, ooo!
Hold on a second!
Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
Yeah?
Dead.
Dade?
Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM!
It's too much machine for you.
It has a killer refresh rate.
Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
Are you challenging me?
Okay. I'll copy it.
And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.
Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
There they are!
Uhhhmm...
Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool?  A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
Alright. How about the Master of Disaster, huh?
Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
Virus?
Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.
So what are we supposed to do?
Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.
They had a large chunk of the garbage file? How much do they know?
You said the worm was untreaceable!
Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!
Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.
My parents are going to come home early tonight.
Brady!
When did this happen?
Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope  she feels better.  Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.
Because the lights are all out.
Four plus Myers.
Who you calling?
Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.
The Discount Mart. Can we get Ice Cream after?
It was the nightmare man
Come on Rachel!
Coming.
Can we go home soon Rachel?
No.
We'll hear sirens soon.
You don't believe that do you?
Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.
You knew. You just didn't care.
Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
This is 132, over.
Get the outside shutters.
Now I pad locked the back door, this is the only way in and out of this house. You got that?
I'll be out on gateway and I doubt I'll be back before the troopers get here.
I am. Ben Meeker.
Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.
Its true, Sheriff.
Something?
Oh Christ. Doc...
Where's the radio?
How's it powered?
Sheriff, what is going on out there?
Okay.
Jamie! Get away!
What?
You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie.
It's been totally charted.
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
What time?
Shit!
I don't see anything.
It's tragic. You never go out. You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much.
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.
What's this big, big news?
What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
Now... First we'll talk a little, then Annie will distract Lindsey and we sneak quietly up the stairs to the first bedroom on the left. Got it?
Yeah.
Go get me a beer.
I gotta go.
Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis.
I suppose I do seem a bit sinister for a doctor.
He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
It's totally insane! We have three new cheers to learn in the morning, the game in the afternoon, I get my hair done at five, and the dance is at eight. I'll be totally wiped out!
Annie, some day you're going to get us all in deep trouble.
Hi, Laurie, what's up?
Well, she's totally not here.
I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.
'Neutron Man'... 'Laser Man'... I can see why. 'Tarantula Man'...
There is no such thing.
There was no one outside.
What did he look like?
Now, I want you to walk to the door, down the stairs and right out the front door.
Will you get her for me?
She's washing her clothes.
I've given them his profile.
If you say so.
Ever done anything like this before?
You don't have to make this harder than it already is.
He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower.
I don't think this is any time to be funny...
I know.  It's terrible!
No, really, I really like him a lot.
Hannah will invite some men over who don't look like Ichabod Crane.
We're a big hit.
Oh!
It's French, though.  It really is.
Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.
Right.
Hmm?
Excuse me, are there any more claims?
Is this your first job?
Really?  Is the food that bad?
Yeah.
Oh, gee, I don't know.  Um...
We could...we could do that.
Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?
You know, there's no reason for panic.  I just want to rule out some things.
Dusty's just bought a huge house in Southampton and he's in the process of decorating it.
What a weirdo that guy is!  Paranoid.  What's the matter with you?
Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
Hi, Dusty.
Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.
Well, are...are they big?
Child molestation is a touchy subject...
Really?  So, so, what else?  Wh- what are you up to?
How about you?
e.e. cummings.  I'd like to get you this.
They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS.
And be ready to make light of the offer if she's unresponsive.  This has to be done very skillfully, very diplomatically.
Your guilt is because you feel the same.
I-I couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks.
That was just perfect.  You've ruined me for anyone else.
Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you.  I-I-I want to do things for you.  Hannah doesn't need me as much.  I'm being presumptuous.  Not that you need me.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
And you're in love overnight?
No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well.
Let's go have dinner, shall we?
Was I?
Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?
But what do, what do you--  what's that mean?  W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?
Are you angry with me?
Are you?
Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us?  About our-our personal life?
I'm not accusing.  I'm asking.  Do you...do you find me too...too giving?  Too-too-too competent?  Too-too, I don't know, disgustingly perfect or something?
Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back?  Do you?  You must.  They- they seem to know so much about us.
Get his wine away.
I don't know about that.  Oh, no, I just, see, I-I've been very, very lucky.  W-when I had the kids, I decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and I've been very, very happy  but...I've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage...
I don't understand.  I thought that you would be happy.
Are you sure?
Mmm  you never know.  They might.  He's just trying to do the nice thing.
You know, you've been very nervous lately.
Like what?
Because I have to!
I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
You've been with someone!
I'm saying it now!
If there's nothing wrong with me  then why does he want me to come back for tests?!
Like what?!  What?
Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...
Can you understand how meaningless everything is?  Everything!  I'm talking about nnnn--our lives, the show...the whole world, it's meaningless.
You're just realizing this now?
Yeah.  What?
A week ago, I bought a rifle.
Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us.
Aah... Hey, have you tried Holly and her friend's shrimp puffs?
...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
Really?
Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!
Glad you could put in an appearance.
Let me get a little reaction here.  How's Elliot?
I think so.
Ohh!
Wow!
What are you talking about?
Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.
Perfect!
Holly, please.  Don't insult me.
I know.  H-how much do you need?
Oh, Hannah!
You know.
Uh-huh.
Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.
Uh, losers!  All losers!
Write!  Let's just not talk about it anymore.
Good.
I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
Can we, can we go?
Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
Yeah.
I'm fine.
Yeah.
No, the reason I ask is--
I haven't.  No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--
You must be joking.  I've been doing all my own reading since I was forty...you know.
Just a few minutes ago.
Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe.
Uh-huh.
Orderly.
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
Say it in English.
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do."  Aren't you part of them anymore...?  Aren't you part of the FBI? 'No Girl's Allowed,' or <u>what</u>?  Have you transgressed...?
No, you're wrong about Verger.
You're ready now.
Then you tell me, then.
How you doin?
Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
Yeah, so where is he?
The identity of the person offering the bounty was never established.
If you would see him monument, look around you.
What do you want me to do?
...thank you...  And how are you this evening, Doctor? No, we know that you're awake...
I like Popcorn...
...here's to child abuse!
I can make you rich.
And I expect you to.  Let's talk like two medical men 
...unmarked hundreds....
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
A fellow with five fingers.
Yes sir, I saw it. 
I know you did what you could.
She threw a punch at a man on the team.
You nervous...?
Waal...
And what was the trip <u>before</u>...?
You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
...your <u>scar</u>..?
Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife Madame Pazzi.
In and out.  Yes.  And Mama... and Mama, is not your real Mama, is she Franklin?
Yes.... yes...
...they eat the dummy, sir, they eat the <u>man</u>... I keep them hungry.  When... when do we think this man arrives.
Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
Indeed we were.
I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
<u>Yes</u>.
...might I make a suggestion...?
Our Mister <u>Frendler</u> to, to, to humiliate me, though....
That's what I should do.  Tell me why?
Yeah, well, they solved that:  turns out, he'uz a <u>cannibal</u>...
What would you guess, Ardelia?
Why?
Yes, but the <u>important</u> thing, as I've said...
...what did you want? 
And why should we believe you?
Yeah, I'm sure it's famed for lotsa things, and you're one'a'them...
...a <u>liaison</u> position...
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
...no...
What's wrong with approval?  You admired that man.
Yes, but no one is in control of their emotions.  that's all we have time for today... 
What is your point?
I..
You want some <u>advice</u>.
My encounter.
Believe me, I wish I knew less.  Oh, if you weren't such a pig...
Why are you...don't stop...why?
And this Peepers was your...dog?  If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention.
That doesn't make me feel better! Why are you being like this?
Summer would have been a lot less without you. You're a true friend, Donald.
Mine!
Hey, I thought I wasn't your type.
Goodnight, Jasper.
You're a little harsh on Todd. You're a little harsh on everybody.

That would be a No.
What are you doing?
Well, the first week of camp has swhooshed on by and I thought this a perfect time to finally pow-wow. I think we should discuss--
Who wants to go tell the Anti-christ to take a "time-out?"
Stop, stop, what was I thinking...out in the wilderness.  Under the stars. I've ruined every--
I have to get up. Still more to do. That boy hates Asian people. That girl thinks she gave her Mom cancer by dropping a plate on her hand. Her daddy touches her. His daddy never touches him. It would have been cooler if I'd died.
Do you really not believe in God?
I should leave. You probably need your rest.
Do you really think we're fooling anyone?
She got a little poison oak and started screaming for assisted suicide.
Excuse me, Wichita, I can't seem to reach the top shelf in the storage room. Could you...
I'm sorry? I don't get it.
Because you're an idiot.
If you're going to openly be a bitch....
I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
I think you can. In Catcher in the Rye Holden says his ideal job'd be making sure some kids don't fall off a cliff. He doesn't realize if you pay too much attention to the kids, you'll back off the cliff yourself.
Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.
What. A. Martyr. Understand; Martha couldn't take the heat so she got out of the kitchen. Just think what a better place the world would be if every nimrod followed her cue.
Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me!  My God, you haven't signed!
Don't talk to me like that.
Veronica, you look like hell.
Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food.
If you inherit five million dollars the same day aliens tell the earth they're blowing us up in two days, what would you do?
I don't know. Should you?
Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.
What are we going to tell the cops? "Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge."
Like a suicide thing?
So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!
Get crucial. We won't be using blanks this time.
They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.
Did not.
She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
We're breaking up. I am out!
Catch a movie? Miniature Golf?
Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
This knife is filthy.
Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head.
How do you turn the fucker off?
You really fucked me up, Veronica.
Answer him dick!
Is it sleeping, dude?
Veronica! J.D. told me you committed suicide last night!
Where is he? Where's J.D.?
I adore anything to do with the arts.
What now?
Hello!
But she'll have no one to look after her!
I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.
My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me, you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little tart!
I'm educating myself!
snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.
hurries over.
I'm saving them for a rainy day.
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
It doesn't matter.
John has fallen in love with me!
Let's go overseas . . .
Hurry up! I'm freezing!
I'm coming with you.
Isn't it beautiful!
Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
Millions of people around the world get on busses every day. When was the last time you heard of anybody anywhere dying on a public transit bus?
Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
We startred off to be. She was, I guess I was. I just sort of....butchered up the relationship somehow.  Bad choice of words.
Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange.
I understand... I won't-
How much time off?
Yeah? You and who else?
Bret. What the hell is going on?
Ambrose. I know.
As in one minus one equals zero yes. Where are you going with this?
That was cold...
Oh my God. It's coming out.
How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year.
You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?
Trevor I've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's. This poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds. So, I've been thinking, what about Daisy?
Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?
You and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident weren't you?
What happens if I'm convicted of Kirsty's murder?
You mean... when the car went off the bridge?
Poor Trevor.
How is our little student doing? Has he learned his lesson yet?
What things do you think you've done?
Wait... what the hell is this...
Whew. You bounce right back don't you?
You okay?
Tawny I think I'm going to be sick.
Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?
Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it's about... what we did together last night.
And you pulled people out? You're...  a hero.
Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!
They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?
The bathroom!  For two days?
There was this kid there saying, "Go in there and save my father, mister." And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself.
We can hope.  You still have your job, right?
Often, uh.
I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..
I seen on the TV where that do-gooder asshole's gonna go visit sick kids at three-thirty.  Children's Hospital, on the double.
Spanish kinda guys!
We're all assholes, Bernie?
I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me?  Ya wouldn't, would ya?
YOU KNOW WHY?  BECAUSE IT'LL BE AN <u>EXCUSE</u>!  IT'LL BE "BERNIE LAPLANTE EXCUSE NUMBER FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SIX."  NO, FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE.  THAT'S HOW MANY EXCUSES YOU HAVE GIVEN ME, I KEEP TRACK OF THEM ELECTRONICALLY. I HEARD THEM ALL, BERNIE.
Ev, it's not my fault!  I'm trying to tell you this incredible --
Three weeks, Ev.  I didn't tell him I killed anybody...
Camera, Chucky.  Are you Bernard LaPlante, sir?  What is your relationship with John Bubber?
How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
He had one <u>tiny</u>, uncharacteristic moment of weakness.  That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime...
A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
Underbelly!
This guy, this "friend" your mother's seeing, he's a fireman, huh?  He ever... spend the night, whatsisname?
You never saw that picture, huh?
Yeah, my dad's great.  He took me to the zoo.
Uh, no.
Yes.
Vietnam!
The...Silver...Mike...Award!
Swiped your purse!  While he was saving you?  You gotta be kidding!
She broke up with her boyfriend.  Listen, babe, we needja back. You gotta follow up on the jumper, find the human interest in the grim, unending tale of woe that pours from the wounded heart of the heartless metropolis.
Quit?  She wants to quit?
Gale shoulda aired that bit first, she's the one who found this clown LaPlante!  She let Channel Eight get a beat on us.
What?
You didn't?
I haven't won it yet.  I notice you've got me scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony.
We're from Channel Four, yes.  We'd like to find --
You didn't... get it on with him?
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
So, <u>Neil</u>.  How's it goin'?
And the rent is okay?
That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is --
You have to put yourself out there a bit more.
Well, these are good signs -- she's broken up with him and the two of you seem to be developing quite a rapport.
An occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
I was alone a lot as a child.  No one to compete with.  My parents ensured that I found happiness in the smallest things.  When you're all alone it's your own world, you don't have to take orders from anybody.  You don't necessarily believe the stories people tell you.
I think we got it just in time before the ink dried.
You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
I know it's at the high end of our range --
But it's what we want.
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
What if someone else buys it in the meantime?
How was your lunch with Charlie?
Do you remember who gave us this?
Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.
I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
Oh God.
Dad, we can't decide unless Rudolf gets to look too!
What about cable?
All right, who ate the last piece of cheesecake?
Neil, do you mind?
All right then, if I have to go to school then I'd better go.
Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
You didn't see this.  Understand?
Hey Lieutenant, the boys in robbery have something I think you should look at.
A few days ago.
You didn't bring me here to talk about her.
Since we hardly know each other, I'm sure you'll understand if I hold one to it for awhile.
Must you do that?
Do you not hear the wind in the trees?  The songs of the birds.  The horses breath?  There is a whole world around you. Alive.  Living.  Feel it -- become part of it.  Live your life, Highlander.  It's going to be a long one.
Can you really tell from doing that?
I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.
I've come to strike a bargain with you.  I wish to learn the power of changing.
And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
Why?
I cannot explain.
Do you love me, Conner?
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I was at the police station earlier today--
Corpses?
Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?
Then who's Russell Nash?
Why do you stare at me like that?
About what?
No.
You have an interesting accent. Where are you from?
Yes -- it is.
Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about--
Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.
--for three hundred years.
Now I can start to live.  To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another.
We found him this morning.
I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
It isn't over, is it, Conner?
Don't leave us, Conner.
I love you, Conner.
Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?
I think he's dead!
Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry?
Talley.
The cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in Beverly Hills.  The phone company shows no unusual --
Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.
Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the back of the house!
But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What if he wakes up?
It's over.  We have to give up.
Yeah.  I'm Rooney.
Talley?
You're a funny guy, Talley.
Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
It ain't been a good day, Chief.
He needs a doctor.
Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
We can take it with us.
I got the gasoline --
What the fuck is that?
Talley lives here.  I don't know if the place has security or not.
You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not <u>talk</u> to them; <u>have</u> them.
I'll kill you!  You won't get the other disk!
That big asshole nailed my windows.
I don't drink beer.
You gotta pee?
I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.
We have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses.
That's not enough.
Chief, base.
Go.
Other people can hear us.  Just call. <u>Please</u>.
Sounds like you know the job.
Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the cars.
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
Excuse me?  <u>You</u> requested our help.  You turned over command --
We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.
The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.
I asked you my name.  You just saw my commission slip.  What's my fucking name?
This is Chief Talley.  Tell me your name, son.
I thought they locked you in your room.
Are the disks still in your room?
That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his way for the disks.
Marlon and Al....
When this phone rings, you answer.  It will be me.  I'll tell you what to do. When I have what I want, you get your family.
We, who is we?
That's what I came to talk to you about.
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
Captain, I must take my family. It is not safe here.
Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
Yes we have.
Paul, I've sent my soldiers to rescue the Lady Prime Minister, she'll need a room.
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
What did you overhear?
Satellites.
If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
Time is money, George. We need extra beer today.
Where are we going, sir?
Are you sure this is the river road?
Paul, how the hell are ya'?
This is a Rolex, I can't take it.
You are the manager?
Was there blood?
Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
I will need a suite.
Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.
What?
Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore.
They are being evacuated.
What's the matter?
You cannot go alone.
Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof?
What sort of car?
What sort of plan?
Oh, my babies.
I managed to get the President of France on the phone.
Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.
When?
Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
It's complicated. But don't worry --
So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --
-- bullshit --
If you don't mind me asking... Who are you?
Jesus H. Christ!
Something just must've...frightened her, that's all.
Now what do we do? We've got to hold him somewhere 'til the police --
What are you playing here, Price?
You're not my list.
'Less the place really is haunted.
-- of this place, goddamnit, Pritchett!
Uhhhh...
Hail Mary, full of grace -- the house is growing!
I don't think so...
We can do it...
I was upstairs with Eddie --
Cheery looking bunch.
What --
No. It's just trying to frighten us.
You okay?
Don't touch me!
I'm impressed: I don't think Evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia.
I'm not laughing, Steven.
Could we have a word?
It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.
You're hurting me.
Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.
They weren't loaded when I put them in there!
No, no, it's just --
My wife. Where were we?
Your roller coaster that is, quote: "unlike any that has ever come before it."
Please! Something! Oh-God!
She's been marked for it. The House does that. Happened to Pritchett's father. Likely happen to you all. Isn't that what you told me, Mr. Pritchett?
What're you talking about?
Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?
Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "Saturation Chamber."
Houston, I think we may have a problem.
"Dummy 6" keeps losing his arm.
I mean, not that it didn't give Evelyn the kind of coronary I had in mind, just...
Rewind that.
But the million bucks each, that's for real?
Believe me, we need to.
-- hey! --
For the love of God....please...?
Sara...?
We don't have proof of that.
Thank you.  If you told me two years ago we'd be living here, I would never have believed it.  Do you live around here?
So was I.  The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not.
Are you all right?
Well then who did?!
Can you talk to her?
My angel!
Why?
I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon.
It's just going to take a while.
But do you agree with me?
It just disappeared.  Literally.
I'm fine.
Should I...
We don't know.
We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.
You've done your homework, Mrs. South.
...at her request.  She was a very religious woman.
Concentrate!  She can hear you!
She's coming back.  Keep talking!
I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've been here before to cast evil from this house.  The amulet is a guard against evil, blessed in countless rituals.   It is an ancient ceremony of the early Catholic church, a ceremony whose secrets are all but lost.
I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
What's going to happen?
Looks like we have some animal hairs in here.  Maybe some kind of a rodent.
So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
Do you have any other physical evidence, that we can look at?
There's something in there.
It's ... I don't know.  First World War, right?
The cusp of my life.  What I was, what I am, what I will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision.  I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery.
Then tell me what to do.
Wha .... ?
It was off the statue.  In the club.
Hold on.  Hold on, please.  I need talk to you.
That's great.
I'm trying to quit.
This is great.  And it's yours?  You like own it?
Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?
Joey ... ?
Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made the store feel strange.  Who'd make such a thing?
Welcome. 38
... Let it define you.  Whatever it is. Most of the roses die behind the bar. This is the first I've given out for nearly a month.
Yes really.
How do we start?
Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?
Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over?  You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.  Just see how we both feel?
Oh, I don't ...
I don't think so.  Not yet.  I'm not ready yet.
Well, forget about it.  Hawk and I are going to Rio.  We're hurt, we're tired, and a hero ain't nothing but a sandwich.  Right, buddy?...
That's your definition of "Hard?"
Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?
I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?
"He can't write his name or read a book.  To fool people is his only thought."
The song's over!  Come on! "You could be swinging on a star."
The Butler did it.  Guy was a cross between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart. Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied dumptied it over Gates's head.  He said it was made by, get this, Leonardo..
But I said I was sorry....
Count of three?
Let's just forget it, I mean...
My life is not some deal.  I...
Italy, France, Moscow.  They all just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man Kaplan thinks since Communism is dead, we got nothing to do.  Man, Democracy isn't free elections. We gotta teach the world that Democracy is Big Tits, College Football on Saturdays, Eddie Murphy saying the word "Fuck" and Kids putting their hands down garbage disposals on "America's Funniest Home Videos."
Did he mention the Mayflowers?
That's the best kind.  A wise woman once said "Polite conversation is rarely either."
I betrayed a man.  A good man.  An innocent man.  A thief.
You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.
God, I wish I could say the same thing.  What about having a nice, dull dinner with me tonight. Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes, Anecdotes about famous dead Italians....
Hey now, outside of a very friendly dog this morning, it's been a slow decade.  I don't make love every ten years, I get a little cranky.
You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.
For two years, I've been tracking the Mayflowers' peculiar interest in three Da Vinci pieces.  Their Sforza replica was as fake as the "gas leak" that supposedly destroyed it.
Does everyone in the world know more than me?  Jesus, I'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half.  Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved!
Selfish attitude?  I'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much foam...
I wanna know...
It's the site of their new museum and we're taking it over.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is going full speed ahead.
That New-York-Italian-Father- made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son- of-a-bitch.  What was our bet?  A million?
What a pleasant surprise.  You're probably wondering...
Have a seat.  Good to see you, buddy ol' pal...
Cool, isn't it?  Weight, feel, mal1eability, they're all but identical.  On the periodic chart of elements, they're but one proton apart.  Great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless.
It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash- crash.  Financial Empires will crumble-crumble.
Who are you? How did you know who I am?
Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
And is this guy from chumpsville?! I pulled the old mother routine --
He didn't offer you money.
-- and she's dynamite!
Not at all. You're light as a feather.
...A Muncie girl! Talk about the cat's pyjamas! Tell you what, Amy. I'm gonna cancel the rest of my appointments this afternoon and get you a job here at the Hud.
Oh, no, really, I --
Oh, is that it!
...You do?
Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well no, I -- I never really... There's a place I go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar.
You don't know anything! Fact is they haven't bought it! The stock is cheap, Archer! What're they waiting for?
...It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
Well, I --
And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here --
Awwww, buddy --
Aw, please, sir -- this job, it's all I got!
I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...
But, Buzz --
Say, that was a swell idea!
Geez, I --
'From the desk of Waring Hudsucker. To. Sidney J. Mussburger. Regarding. My demise. Dear Sid. By the time you read this, I will have joined the organization upstairs -- an exciting new beginning. I will retain fond memories of the many years you and I -- '
Yeah?
I'm brushing up on my French with the most charming man, Pierre of Fifth Avenue. Do you know him?
Well, frankly, I...
My God! The Bumstead contracts!!
Not that way! Through the door!
There's one in every story.
...He's not noticing, Benny.
She's good, Bennie.
A puff-up, I call it.  But Miss Jessica always says "brioche."
Where?
You mean a figurehead.
I think you need some help.
You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
You're single?
They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital.  I had my suspicions, though, about the Directress of Training.
Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.
But don't you have to work?
Listen, did I tell you that story about the little mule at the plantation -- the little mule and Clement?  Let me tell you.  It's one of the funniest stories --
Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
She hated sleep.  She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
You didn't find your patient so frightening in the daylight, did you?
And charming?
I've never given it much thought.
You didn't drive her mad.
Well?
Help me? How?
I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.
You wanted to warn me...
I wouldn't worry too much, Commissioner.  It'll pass.  We've had this sort of thing before.
This is something else.  They're curious.  Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
Two things had happened, Mrs. Rand. One was that your daughter-in-law had been taken ill with a fever. The other thing -- completely disconnected -- was that you had wished her ill, because she had hurt your sons.
All that you say comes down to the same thing.  You are asking me to pass a sentence of life or death on my own wife.
I tell you he hasn't and he wouldn't dare use it if he had.
Darned right. Look here, Benj, whaddya make of this sequel to The Godfather? You think it's gonna work?
Don't be so modest, Ben. It's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit --
It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.
-- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --
It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup.
Don't be dim.
Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like.
Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
You've...
You're not going to --
Oh you know, for a minute I thought it was --
All right.
See you.
Have I noticed anything? I'm not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her.
Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you are.
What are you talking about?
Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. One or two, you know, good-natured encounters, that doesn't mean I'm... I'm not just some toy for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the party, I just did them, that's all, because I wanted to do them before I saw Jimmy.
What you been up to?
He's probably been waiting all night at the station.
Well, I have to say I don't have much faith that my car keys are still in that bowl. Doesn't seem entirely safe, leaving your car keys around?
That's fine. I wouldn't expect you to see it any other way.
You want to come in, get a cup of coffee -- warm up? I can either walk you home, or you could crash in the guest room.
I saw you on your bike today.
Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook.
Educated guess.
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
Huh?
Check it out. Not for the faint of heart.
Everything's gonna freeze, the big freeze.
You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?
The Idiot?
Frankie opens them with his teeth.
Mikey?
Maybe we can just watch some TV.
You get in trouble?
I have not touched your sh--  Stuff. You watching this?
How are the parental units functioning these days?
I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.
What are you doing at home on a Friday night?
Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p.o.'d.
All my model planes.
Are you his girlfriend?
Good.
Nice kid.
And then I lost him.  In the fog.
We already did.
The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.
How much closer would you say you were?
We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
When's that, a week?  Two weeks?...  We have to figure out a plan of action now.
He's asking everybody questions.
Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
One of your cases?
Will.
I don't know what you're fucking talking about.
It was like some big fucking secret!
What was?
Yes.
Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.
Randy Stetz is in jail.
Wild card.
Disappointing, isn't it? To come so far and find so little. Jaded ingenues, amusing themselves with make- believe...
She is.
Then blame the one who made her...
Lestat! You knew Lestat!
I couldn't prevent it.
No.
What you are? You would be something other than you are?
It will grow back again!
I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
Louis, put me in my coffin...
Why does he call you that?
You... fed on me?
You both did it?
But now's the time to end it, Louis. Now's the time to leave him.
Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.
In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our own kind. Find the one who made him. Learn what it means.
She's no vampire.
I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!
What danger?
But if she dies...
Let's call that a start.
I can't do it.
Take him.
But we can live without taking human life. It's possible.
I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
What do you imagine you are Louis?
Lestat - finish this -
Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me...
I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!
You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...
You followed me here, didn't you?
How did you do that?
The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
Yes.
Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
Their stuff in there...  ...and ours in here.
Yes.
It's okay...He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too.
Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
The shower again?
Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school...  Are you okay?
I'm okay.
What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
And it's been blue skies all day. It might be perfect all weekend.
No, no, no. This was really sweet...
There was a body! I swear it!
If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it.
You sure you didn't pick up my hair tie?
I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle.
Oh, look. Another day in paradise with Julie-your-tour-director...Miss Psychotic Episode.
Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.  Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.
What's the matter, boy trouble?
What's going on?
We'll only be a second, okay?
What is up with that weirdo?
I wonder if my editor's psychic? Reports from the Greek front are going to be a little vague.
I have not been on the island in twenty years. It is changed - changed completely. Where are the graves -- the coffins?
There was some trouble here ——the villagers on the mainland —-this island was the focal point of their anger. They came here ——broke open the tombs and despoiled the graves.
All the graves?
I'm not sure that it is the plague.
You were singing, weren't you? A beautiful voice, Miss St. Aubyn.
I have been troubled about you. I want you to know that my room is just downstairs --  You have only to cry out if you are ill —— or frightened.
Cathy —- how does it feel to have a father?
I have forgotten it, dear.
You will not say one single word. I know your secret.
You've been playing on the superstitions of that poor old man — — working at him — — turning him against Thea.
If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
Her name is Thea?
This girl --
I can't understand that.
I had a notion you had become self—appointed chaperone lately — why?
Daughter -- my daughter --
Are you running a business or a charity ward?
Who?
Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
Yeah, very funny.
Oh, I know all about you. I've watched you grow up from a little boy.
I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class.
It isn't me!
No wonder you jumped in the river.
Where's Mary?
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
Yeah –– yeah –– hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
Oh –– Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
Mother . . .
Well, sure I do.
When'd you see him last?
Want to give my flower a drink.
What?
I'm not sleepy. I want to look at my flower.
Zuzu –– Zuzu. My little gingersnap! How do you feel?
Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, Sam.
Oh –– Welch. That's what I get for praying.
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.
Hmmmm . . .
Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?
George! George!
Is it a charge, sir?
Mr. Gower, I think . . .
No . . . No . . . No. . .
You want a martini?
Okay –– all right. Double bourbon, quick, huh?
He's pretty young for that job.
Still after that first million before you're thirty.
Yes . . . Yes . . . You're right, son.
Mary . . . Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors. I . . . I . . . I . . .
George, was it a nice wedding? Gosh, I wanted to be there.
Now look, did you buy anything?
Pop!
Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.
Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
Do I look as funny as you do?
Well, why don't you say it?
Uh-huh.
All right, for a minute. I still can't understand it though. You know I didn't tell anybody I was coming here.
You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you . . .  . . . Your what?
Oh, George, George, George.
What?
As soon as you get us on the island, you got to call in.  My dad's the mayor....
I thought you said she was going with us?
Let's just go sailing, okay?
Hey!
Abandoned?  It's a little early in the season for that.
We got a helluva tide this month.
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
How long ago?
Untie that rope.
Where to?
Jesus, don't freeze on me.  What about the others?
Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and I didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in- law, in Montauk, he works at a hi- fi store, and they sell cameras, so he....
Me neither.
May I have this dance?
Where the hell were you?
Why?
Listen -- what are you doing later?
Mmmm.
Sean's awake.
Where's my day book?
Boat nut.  What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating?
Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.
Because of today?  The beach?
I'll give notice.
I'm showing summer rentals.  We got a helluva season going.
I know, I know....
A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
Martin, could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something?
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!
Harbor Air, do you read?  Over?
Then nothing.  If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.
Can I go swimming?
Hang on!
Dad!  Dad!
They made me go with them.
I told you, remember?
Did you ever see a dolphin?
Whoops, almost lost one.  Can't play with the dolphins without skis....
Terry!  You okay?
Me neither.
No class.
You want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this?
What Kids?  Who went out?
Too hot tor those two?  I can't believe it.
It'll be fun, come on!
Maybe you and Brooke could come over to the town beach....
What's wrong?
So?  So?
I'm only walking him.  You caught him.  You have to be exhausted.
No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.
Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
Aren't you suiting up, mate?
No.
Thank you.
Damn it.  I can't understand!  I gotta go, hon.
Don't forget you have your brother.
Yeah.
Hi, baby.
Baby goddamn scared me to death!
It's romantic down here.
... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?
Swim where?  Out there?  Oh, no, forget it, not me!  You go, I'm staying.
You would, wouldn't you?  I'd end up whale shit, you wouldn't care.
You're going down there again?
What's that?
I need more pressure in the shark tank.
Michael, come on, don't be silly. This is the quickest way.  You're not going to walk all the way around?
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
Me.
I want that shark, Kathryn.
It's no use.  They won't come into the lagoon.
Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.
Why?
Afraid I can't do that.
Why are you?
We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.
Give me a ride?
Sure.
He's missing.
Kelly, could you look after Sean for a while?  Show him around for me?
That's too bad.  I don't like water.  I don't like being around in.  I never go in it.
This is where to be.  High and dry.
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
The one that goes underwater?
No, Kelly, I don't want to...
Come on, it's fun!
Told you you'd like it.
Let's go, let's go!
You set that thing off down there, you don't know what will happen.
That's how they do it, you know. Seizes its prey and shakes its body savagely.  Teeth gnaw through a man like a buzz saw.
Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
South Georgia, Antarctica.
Actually, thirty-five is probably more accurate.
We see him, Mike.  Between the stadium and the ski show island.
This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.
You're welcome.  I was the one who cried.
You said it wasn't polite to interrupt people....
It sure is good to be home....
We need beer....
I take out the garbage, because...I'm glad we got that straightened out....
We don't want any....
I never....
No one.  Nothing.  We've got to get this finished before the tide comes in.
What's it cost to take a ride on that plane...?
I almost forgot....
It came for him.  It waited all this time and it came for him....
I want you to get out of the water....
Mom, you're upset.  Sit down...Please....
Don't be such a Grandma...I was always climbing something....
All you all right?
Okay.
I want you to give up your work....
It's not easy.  None of it is.  I have to find some way to get on with my life and I'm going to try.  I finally figured that out.  I'm going to do my best....
It's late....
Trying to write our report....
Why'd you come out here?
We will...We'll have a lot of time together, Michael....
It could have been an accident....
Sure you can....
Where do I pull off...?
You're impossible....
Why?
They had them on the big one....
I have coffee in the thermos.
Yeah....
Still tagging conch?
Tricky little devils, aren't they? How's the degree doing?
She has good days and bad...I don't know....
Feathers all over the place....
We're being paid to see where they go...How they propagate....
I know how to tag a damn conch....
You couldn't find your ass with both hands....
Hey!
What happened to Clarence and...?
We're out of money, partner.. We wrap it up, write it up and turn it in... How come your heart sounds stronger than mine?  You got two of them...?
We don't write up anything until we're done....
When I invited you...
We got it together, Jake....
What she's got.  Nine knots....
How long have you known Hoagie?
We lost it....
It's my turn in the barrel, man....
I don't like it....
What about Carla's gig?
How come only me?
Maybe he only likes white meat....
Shit....
Stop that!
Your equipment has crapped out again....
Who grows more beautiful....
I just want to make an honest woman of you....
Manage the whole damn place some day. I'm looking forward to living in the style to which I would like to become accustomed....
That bad, huh?
Did you like that, Mama?
What? Whatta you mean, no? Who is -- who is telling you? Whatta you mean, no? Yes, you'll wear pink or else. Or else you'll wear pink.  And, darlin', oh, I'm gonna take you to Coney Island.
Is it your vehicle?
It's a technique I read about. If you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs, throw one cigar- ette away, and smoke 59. Day 2, you throw 2 away and smoke 58 ..
Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles.
We're going.
Pay me, and I shut up.
Then give me that Zippo.
Why?
I remember the old bastard's liver! I don't believe you did that. I had a great sent- imental attachment to that.
Six girls over a period of 18 months, and give or take a head or two, the M.O.'s exactly the same. Dark hair. No hands. All shot with a high velocity twen- ty-two in the back of the head.
That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me?  He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you.
Sure.
I dunno what I'd do with your help. I've gotta take her out of there ..
Bits.
Why did he ask if it was frozen?
Yes, Sir, I think they maybe. I think "Jennifer," and this lady got hit by the same guy?
No.
I'll sign anything you want. <u>Please</u>. Bring here her .. <u>I want Helena here</u> ..
What does that mean, Sergeant?
Alright, gentlemen, I'm gonna leave you. I got a couple of questions for the paper, Serg- eant? Mind if I swing by later, wring out a tea-bag with you?
.. feel like I'm getting close to this guy .. and all the time, feel like I'm sharpening a pencil with a broken load .. I'm sorry, King J ..
You don't know what you done, Taylor.
I'm Mr Berlin.  Mr Ross is right here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's O.K.?  O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft- ernoon she left? Take your time, and nothing's too trivial, O.K.
You must have some idea about him.
Can I see your hands?
Yes.
No, just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door - no one home, so I followed the music ..
I'm sorry. I'll get my things.
No.
Oh.
Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with.
Do you pray?
He don't know that. I didn't.
Is that Margie?
Shut up, King Jay ..
I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.
King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!
What do I do?  How do I spin this?
What was our deal when we first got together?  Brutal truth, remember?
Wait.  Did I just say "hon" to him?
Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
Just be friendly and say "no comment."
Oh come on --
Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
That took guts.
Happy for us... okay.  Here's the number. 404-453-2222.
Well, good evening.
Yeah, what happened there.
We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere.
Wow.  That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, "it's nobody's fault." It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it --
Maybe you should call her.
No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
Why do you love me?
I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now.
You are a single mother.  You have given up the right to be frivolous.
Oh, thank you.
I want him to go number one in the draft, and I want him to play.
I got it.
At last I find you.
You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there?  Did I ever tell you my Nike story?
You're loving me now, aren't ya?
Sure you don't want to go out and find some karoake?  I'm a very good singer, man --
Huh?
I'm out here for you!  You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you.
Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
Oh I know plenty.  I was raised by a single mother.
I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer?
Then why'd you get married?  I'm asking you as a friend.
Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --
Jerry!  You made it --
What --
You're with the sports people on the plane, right?
I uh... don't think we're quite at your pitch yet.
You gonna get that --
SMI represents all three quarterbacks on your team, where's their loyalty going to be?  You stay with me, I'd fight for YOU alone.  You'd be my only client on that team...
Hi.
Let's go the zoo.
Funny.
This is how you make dinosaurs?
Oh, my God.
Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea!
Young adult.
It's not safe.
What?...WHAT!?
My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing.
We should try fishing again.
You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low.
I thought you were an expert.
We'll be broke in four weeks.
No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!
Listen Alan, I really appreciate you bringing me along.
Not with that sail.  Spinosaurus Aegypticus.
It looks intact.
We could co-write a paper.
We need to keep moving.
Good luck with the fund raising.
What did you think?
But then you never get to go in space.
We're safe!
Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
I have never been on this island!
Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy. They won't do a God Damn thing.
How did you know?
You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the last time you answered your phone?
Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck to return?
"Minimal" is too much.   It has to be light, it has to be strong --
The empty shells are crushed and trampled.  The young stay in the birth environment, that's conclusive!
That was about a year ago.
Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
Cancel that, Dieter.
Where's the power and radio setup?
What's he got in there?
Their what?
What?
Then this is our chance.
Lava?
Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.
Funded by whom?
Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths.
Give it more morphine!
Where's Kelly?
Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes.  Drop what you are doing and leave now.
What?
Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?
I will not do it.  You'll have to get somebody else, because I will not.
No, no, no, that's crazy, you're out of your mind, he's absolutely out of his mind - -
How would we cut off the lysine?
Yours was fully illustrated, honey.
Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing.  Seems to happen about every six weeks or so.
I have samples all over the kitchen. 
There you are.  Out you come.
And what are those?
- - like birds - -
- - what happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them - -
No.
God creates dinosaurs.  God destroys dinosaurs.  God creates man.  Man destroys God.  Man creates dinosaurs.
Oh, imperfections?
Up and down, up and down!
Are they heavy?
This is overwhelming, John.  Are these characters  animatronics?
Tim.  Which car were you planning on - -
And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
Tim, are you okay?
You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
You got any kids?
Machines hate you?
Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
What?  What can we do?
That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your Park.
All night?
Let's go!
Alright Donald, alright, but just let him talk.  I want to hear all viewpoints.  I truly do.  I truly am.
You don't give us our due credit.  Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before.
Well?
Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.
We miss you.
Thanks for the presents.
They don't bother me.
Fifty.
You tell them if they come up to seventy-five, I'll cut them in on the Crystal Lake package.
Beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches...  We can do some great logging up here.
Mister Biller?
I seem to recall arguing the same thing in court while you were trying to file murder-one charges.
It's still on.
What?
I thought that was Ted Bundy.
Well?
No. When you put me on the stand, I'll say your client is catatonic and exhibits classic symptoms of a schizophrenic, sociopathic personality.  And he doesn't sleep.
This is bad, Joe. The Prosecution is already putting together a team of psychiatric specialists. They'll argue exactly the opposite. They'll say he's just pretending to be catatonic and he's completely sane.
There's nothing to see here. He sleeps... we record it. That's all that happens.
Fascinating.
I thought you said Krueger burned to death.
That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
It's all right. I'm simply in shock... this is what happens to people when they experience events they can't understand or comprehend. The mind shuts down temporarily and tries to shield itself from the horrific imagery it's been exposed to.  I'm going to need a lot of therapy.
Where's he going?
Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.
I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.
Krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal, like us.
You look like brothers.
-- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family.
If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
It's my last and final one.
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
He's usually in the storage room sorting things out.  He can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.
I did not realize it was obligatory.
No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.
What?
He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
Or what if there really <u>was</u> an error? -- I don't know what kind -- any kind that needed correcting -- and what if Burgel was responsible for it?  One mistake -- even a small one in a firm like ours -- it could cost him a promotion.
-- I've just come from the Castle.  It's over.
Gabriela ...?
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
What makes you think so?
Anyway, I'd like you to reflect that in me you have -- I won't say a friend, because we're complete fencers, of course -- from distinctly incompatible social classes -- but to some extent, shall we say, an interested third party.
What did she say?
I didn't realize you'd been here that long.
-- And the new patients they bring me aren't usually as dexterous as you've been in evading us.  Not perfect specimens by any means, but not the type of person who'll be missed either.
I want to thank you.
Jack! This is the archeological find of the century!
He's gonna die! They'll kill him!
Ann ... Ann!
Native costume?
What was it, Jack?
Well -- well I'm just back. And -- I must tell you -- something quite wonderful.
I'd just be guessing.
Well I have to close up now.
Oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it?
No, that's not --
Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't --
No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me?
Yes.
If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
I said yes, I see.
Will you let me ask you some questions?
Tell me about acting -- what are you doing tomorrow -- where do you go?
I go on rounds.
Did you like my friend Frankie?
It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --
Mm.
Arlyn Page.
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me.  You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women.
No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
I am scared. The things I do. The things I could do to you.
I saw Mr. Faber.  You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?
What am I supposed to say?
Mm.
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.
All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?
You must be discouraged.
What?
Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients?
Have you discussed this with them?
I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.
Did she talk about him to you?
I know Tom Grunemann.
No.
No.
I don't know. It looks familiar to me.
Mr. Kramer?
Does that distress you?
He hits me on the planet Kriptarium, when I steal the buried treasure from the famous peanut butter factory.
Ladies and gentlemen...
When is mommy coming back?
You forgot the milk.
Well, I see the Yankees finally won a game.
You get a new fence.
All it is is onions and gravy.
Then eat around it.
Mom--I mean, dad?
Yeah, there was apple juice.
Where will my toys be?
Your mom knows all about The Face, okay?  Don't worry, she'll tell The Face to beat it.
Yes...Look, during the last five years we were married, I had...I was getting more and more...unhappy, more and more frustrated.  I needed to talk to somebody.  I needed to find out if it was me, if I was going crazy or what.  But every time I turned to Ted--my ex-husband, he couldn't handle it.  He became very...I don't know, very threatened.  I mean, when- ever I would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack.  Anyway, we became more and more separate ...more and more isolated from one another.  Finally, I had no other choice, I had to leave. And because of my ex-husband's attitude--his unwillingness to deal with my feelings, I had come to have almost no self- esteem...  At the time I left, I sincerely believed that there was something wrong with me--that my son would be better off without me.  It was only when I got to California and started into therapy I began to realize I wasn't a terrible person.  And that just because I needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child, that didn't make me unfit to be a mother.
Objection!
Now then, Mr. O'Connor, how long did Ted Kramer work for you?
No.
Were you?
I thought you might just like to know that at five-fifteen this afternoon we were officially handed the Fire and Ice account by Revlon.
Ted, I'm leaving you.
I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry.
How's the new job?
I want my son.  I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son.
Joanna, I don't give a--
Yeah, well he did, didn't he.
He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours...  I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...
But...just in case...I mean, just on the off chance she doesn't. What are you going to do about the kid?
Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay?  But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while.  Just until you get yourself straightened out.
Well, ah...I thought it over and I decided we're doing it Murray's way.
And?
I can't.  I've got Billy to take care of.
Kramer, I'm sorry.  All I was trying to do was--
I know....I know.
That's if we win.  If we lose, you could end up having to pay your wife's court costs as well.
The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
I'll take my chances.
It's going to cost.
Things? What kind of things?
Lenox Hill.  77th Street between Park and Lex.  The emergency number is 327-0800.
Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying.  Where's Joanna?
We must go, Holiness.
Your people are very brave. They are fighting the Chinese. No one can stop them. Not even me.
I have.
The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the "Chinese region of Tibet". We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it.
At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.
Roughly five thousand men.
Is that big?
Will we be in this war?
No. This war is almost over.
What was the warning of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama?
Tell me.
I am sorry for you to have to witness this, Kundun.
Ask whatever you will.
So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
Britain?
Did you ever doubt it?
I will not go.
Please, come in, so cold.
I have great hopes for the future of our co-operation.
I leave tomorrow.
Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
Is that a true story, or pretend?
I want to go down there.
You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
Then, I am lucky. I am still too young.
I will miss you.
We have had fun, you and I. Fun for a little boy in an old palace.
Look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. Look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. Look for a kind heart.
Thank you.
It happens when I land.
Could <u>she</u> stay, we've tentatively scheduled intercourse.
You listen to me.  The only reason I'm letting you be part of this is 'cause you got the helicopter and the radar--
Just spit him back out.  Some shall live, some shall die, arbitrarily, sound like any higher power we know?
Then do it!!
At school they'd always say "go" first.
Well, you can try talking them into that, if--
But they're nighttime hunters, Hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway.
None of us actually <u>saw</u> anything.  I realize this Sir, but something flipped us over, I doubt very much it was a mink.
Are you sure?
Hector.  What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
Nothing's real.
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
The Museum of Natural History doesn't send out investigators to--
You flew up here because your boss--
Okay.  We're up at six.
You okay?  Kelly?
<u>Are</u> you okay?
A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks.
Ssssh!
I'm not mushing it.
<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!
Are we crazy?
He doesn't seem to be swimming.  Is he swimming?
Get him onto shore.
Well...
It was... something meeting you.
You think?
Get back from the shore.  We know how fast he can leap out.
I can't.  I'll get Hector!!
If you get a safe shot...
<u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.
And this is how he came to the boat?
What?
I thought I saw...
You like Jack?
You think Jack's handsome?
Hector, Jack, we show you with about twelve minutes of oxygen left, and you're on the last tank. Time to go home.
What?
Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a second?
That's not what you came to say.
Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?
Hey.
Sorry?
What do you expect, mugging me from behind?
It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
Myra.
Clarice - you did the best anybody could have for Catherine Martin. You stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you tried. It's not your fault it ended this way.
I don't know! Get me out!!
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
Lecter carved up nine people - that we're sure of - and cooked his favorite bits. We've tried to study him, of course - but he's much too sophisticated for the standard tests. And my, does he hate us! Thinks I'm his nemesis... Crawford's very clever, isn't he? Using you.
I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.
Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
Do you need a police escort, Starling? Or do you think you can find the airport by yourself?
Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling.
Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?
I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out?
Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me.
Miggs has been murdered.
Why?
I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal.
Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you?
Lecter is still the key, I know he is. Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before.
I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell?
You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.
What do you do when you're not detecting, Officer Starling?
"We" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I expect.
I am, yes.
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
Then please - do this test for me.
What's that, Dr. Lecter?
Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?
I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
Horses - and sheep...
Two months.
Did he try to?
I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
He kills w-
No, he covets. That's his nature. And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer.
All right, then tell me how -
Early. Still dark.
Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.
It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.
What...?
Of course it counts. How do you play?
Your West Virginia specimen gave us quite a bit of trouble, but I finally managed to narrow his species through chaetaxy - studying the skin.
The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, Alice...
"We're a breed apart and we make no sense"...?
I'm sorry.
My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yours.
You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not understand what is happening here. And it is not as I imagined it would be, thinking of it in Boston and London...
What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not.  If they do not arrive, the fort will fall. If that happens, stay close to your father.  The French will protect the officer class among the English.
My letter...
There was none!
The man encouraged the colonials to desert in this very room, in my presence. He is guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged like any other criminal, regardless of what he did for my children.
Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect you immensely... I wish they did, but my feelings don't go beyond that. Do you see?
I see...
No.
No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.
Then what?
What did you say?
I'll cover them from the top of the casement.
The red man put down the bow, picked up the fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest. Yes. It is the only way.
Yes, Mr. Poe? So?
I know.  One has to give Americans "reasons" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here.
Sergeant! Form three ranks!
Sir!
We must... stop... soon. Women are... tired.  You... understand?
I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
Gold could be arranged.
British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!
Why do hate the Grey Hair, Magua?
Yes.
That's where a lead bullet has torn you.
Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
Granted.
Carry them to England to your King with pride.
I am deeply touched by such unusual and unexpected generosity... The fort is yours under the condition that we be given until dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and women for their march and turn our wounded over to your surgeon.
Qui vive?
What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?
What's wrong?
And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
That it acquires intelligence from its victims?
Go on!
No!
Shit...
Look at my foot, sir!  This bitch put a goddamn sea monster in my bunk!
What are you doing?
We made it!
...I'd really have to show it to you.
Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
Give me a readout, DeJesus.
I know that.
But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
I say we should go get in the escape bubbles and get the hell out of here!
You guys are crazy.  What the hell you play that stupid game for?
Getting some food.
How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
Tip top, Willie...tip top.
Answer them and quit kicking me!
Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that it's legal.
Hatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man: Barry the Baptist.
I don't know how you've reached that conclusion.
We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
The boys had 'em. I know you like these things; wondered if you wanted them?
Son, have a look in his locker.
How long has he been in there, son?
That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money- loaning business, all right, son?
Is that you, Dean?
OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?
That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.
Jesus, I have heard about him.
I want you to search the house for bugs. I mean I want you to strip it.
There's one steel gate as you go in but they never lock it.
What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?
Don't you stags move or I'll kill the lot of ya.
Right, his leg's going now.
All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.
No I fucking don't! You can't make a cup of tea, Edward.
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
Tom, don't mess around, let's go.
It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
It's pay day, ain't it?
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.
I thought you were going to leave me out there all day.
Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.
Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.
Oh, you assume, do ya? What do they say about assumption being the brother of all fuck-ups?
Where did you get those from, a museum?
You would take a pain ín the arse full stop.
We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?
It's my life. If I want to fuck it up, that's my business.
Who's "they"?
Did you know he was going to be there last night?
How's business?
You know the popular version of how he left town.
You uhm--you remember what old Buddy carried for a side arm?
It's your deal. You sweated it out of him, you pick it up.
You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. Those old boys in Ciudad Leon--
--and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--
You look awful good in that uniform, though.
No. You?
You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--
350 pounds.
He's still pissed off about it.
These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
Something like that.
What?
Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
The Sheriff says we shouldn't touch anything,
Never thought I'd see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman with three up and three down on her shoulder.
It's a .45.
They were using M-1's, yeah--
Seriously, I think we should get married.
That's where he fell.
So tell me why I shouldn't make this place off-limits.
Not much, jefe. Some watermelons.
This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?
Como se llama? [What's your name?]
Senora Cruz?
You have somebody else out there?
Enrique! Quienes son estos? How could you bring them here?
Senora, anything it costs, I can work--
"Fishbait," says Buddy, in that quiet way of his, "What you know about them tires that went missing from markets?" Fishbait thinks for a minute, then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it, "C'mon out, Pooter, they caught us!"
Sam! I was just telling a few about your old man.
--Santiago.
I always wondered what you Mayors do when you're not cutting ribbons.
Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
We have a murder?
I got an idea what happened.
How 'bout the Sheriff?
Yeah, that's the story of my life.
I've seen 'em.
I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.
Pilar, is uhm--is Amado okay?
I don't think you can take it personally--
I'd like to see them spend a day pulling 14-year-olds off of each other--I should get combat pay--
What's she singing about?
You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
Murdered him?
I was--I was real sorry about Nando. He was a good fella. We haven't talked since.
I thought you got through that pretty well.
People liked him.
Amado.
We thought we were something, didn't we?
I look at my kids in school--tenth, eleventh graders. That's who we were. Children.
So what are we gonna do about this?
She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.
From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.
You're out early.
Uh-huh.
I'm going over to the other side.
Gotta be in person.
You telling me what to do, Roderick?
This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
--but longhorns are hard to come by these days.
Buffalo chips. Fella in Santa Fe told me he sells these as fast as the buffalo can squeeze 'em out.
He's gonna find out.
Mister D'Amour?
They go together.
Nix.
I'm sure they'll have this place rigged.
Billy?  This was on Miller's forehead.  Any idea what it is?
I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?
Right.
You don't have a clue what you're into, do you?
Who did this?
I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life.
He's a priest?
Does that mean...?
Harry.
I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.
It was more than that, I think.
I wasn't.
It's okay.
... oh... God...
...yes?
Sure.
Somebody killed him.
Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read.
What makes you so sure?
--vanished.
You believe that?
So could you walk on water?
I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
I heard he was the best.
Go away.
Then what do you want?
You know of him?
What for?
I like to know why things happen.
Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
I tried to pay you off.
I'm sorry, D'Amour...
My God.
You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
At birth.  I don't know you --
I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
Oh yeah?
You think I'm an asshole.
And you believed him?
Can you do it?
One question.
Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
What is?
Nix! Nix!
I've got so much power to give you, Swann.  All you have to do is...beg.
And?
Because you've got nothing else to live for.
Wait... you still feel something for that bitch?
Hello?
Bob, it's me.
You'll do it?
Two years.
Try twenty-five.
No, yes, it does...
But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
You made it.
Four.
Oh, I guess you're busy, huh.
What do you want to drink?
Hi, Bob.
Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
Thanks.
Hello, darling.
Well, that's good, I have to get the kids off for school.  Can I call you in a little while?
What are you talking about?
I don't know.
Fine. Is it going ok?
How'd it go today?
No, what are you talking about.
I don't know what to do.
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Character and calling? Is this yours?
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
What?  That's horrible!
I'm gonna have to get a restraining order.  What a nightmare.
What're these?
Yes.
Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.
George, come in.  What the hell happened to you?
Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
But your patient is legally entitled to it.
I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?
So I guess Satan lost.  Satan is the weak one.
You need his blood-type.  Like right away.
You just call?
May I help you?
You're sure?  There was nothing?
At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man, Peter.
You should think about getting professional help.
I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
What are you looking for exactly?
We needed to know all we could.
What do you mean?
I'm scared I'm slipping back.
We're going to do this.
Why did you lie to me about your parents' deaths?
Why didn't you just go along with Townsend.  Get rid of me.  I would've...
Plenty of time.
Hello?
I've filed a report with Father Frank.
You're referring to the defense's efforts to prove that George Viznick is tormented by "demonic voices?"
Hey!  Mr. big shot.
Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...
What's this?
Where is she now?
Yeah, you met her?
There you go.
You're the one always turning your nose up at me.
I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
What are you talking about?
How is she alright looking the way she does?
The blue.
So you're still breast-feeding?
I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
What?
You could make a career by telling me where.
Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what?
To do what you love.
You need to.  She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind.
Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
Mom tell you to do this?
Yeah, right.
They ever love you back?
Coach hates me, doesn't she?
Thanks.
Yup.  So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years.
Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.
So how come you could play basketball?
I just can.
You do act different.
I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
You don't look half-bad.
Guess not.
I can't help girls coming up to me.
Then prove her wrong.
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
Kiss my booty.
Nah.  Don't sweat it.
Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
So you fucked around to prove a point!
I just said I didn't fuck around.  But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me.
Look, I'm entering the draft.
We won the championship.
Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
What do you mean?
A rest?
That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
Maybe go back to school.
It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.
You asked me what was missing.
What?
So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.
We were just studying.
You work too hard, Pop.
Sorry.
We ain't got nothing to talk about.
From your mouth.
What do you want?
I can see that.  I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself.
What surery?
I can't believe you're gonna do this to me, the situation I'm in, I don't -- Avi: You know what?  Being hit by lighting doesn't matter for getting braces, ok? Now Solomon, let me just ask you once: Please. Please. Don't do this.
How are you paying tor the braces, Donnie?
No need for braces, Donnie.
Jimmy you look like you're about to fuckin' die right here --
What kind of Cancer?
It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?
It's a helluva disease.
...what the fuck is this...?
I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.
Don't sit down.
Why are you here, why are you doing this? Coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore?
I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --
No.
I'm a bit of a slob myself.
That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?
Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --
What's that stand for?
Just Jim.
Bye, bye, Claudia.
Really?
You wanna make a deal with me?
That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
Yeah.
I'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon.  That you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me --
I lost my gun.
No, what's wrong?
Hello.  You're back again, huh?
yeah, yes, hi, hello.
Cynthia?
I have to go to the bathroom, Cynthia.
Stay quiet...stay quiet, son --
DADDY, FUCK, DADDY, DON'T GET MAD AT ME. DON'T GET MAD AT ME --  JUST GIMME YOUR MONEY.
I think it's more complicated than that little man.
Put me on the payroll, find out, find out wassup --
You don't just sign up to be a police officer -- it's about three years of training -- ok?
Why the hell aren't you in school?
Not yet -- "give you the clue for the bust if you show me some trust --"
Just throw some money around. Money, money, money.
What?
Why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold.
Stay that way.
Gently, son --
FUCK YOU.  I pay you, I paid you. I give you a fucking chance and a chance and over and over, over you let me down.  I trust you with so much. The keys to my store, the codes to my locks, the life, the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seven-eleven, late, <u>always</u> late, loans -- I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did --
You were gonna ask me weren't you?
He has Phil right now.
Time lines, y'know?  I remember things but not so -- right there -- y'know?
Go fuck myself?
Alright.  Thank you.
Let's talk about --
It's fine.  I can bleep it out.
-- just to clarify --
I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --
We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --
I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
Does you mother still work?
I wouldn'tve asked --
And you ended up at UC Berkely --
Do you have your masters?
So....Phil....um...I think I'm gonna step in and try and see him and say something if he can...talk...I mean:
I don't think, he can't...
There's no disturbance.
Don't test me, you wanna talk about what the law book says, we can do that, push me far enough and I'll take you to jail -- now calm down.
No.  I said that.
And what about screaming?
It's a free country, you can think anything you want.
THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
What the fuck is this, Jimmy?
Yeah. Yes.
What happend to you?
Rose is on the phone and here's the cards for today --
I need you to get me Paula --
I'm drinking.
She went crazy.  She went crazy, Rose.
I love you.
How do we do this, then?
I'm a bad person.
Is it over 'cause you're sick?
Do you feel better now that you've said this?
I don't know....
I really don't know.
Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay?
Hello?
No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --
What kind of medication are you on right now, Linda that's --
-- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
Now you must really shut the fuck up, please. Shut The Fuck Up.
I've got Frank...Frank Earl's son. He's...he asked me to get him and I did --
listen...listen to me now, Phil: I'm sorry, sorry I slapped your face. ...because I don't know what I'm doing... ...I don't know how to do this, y'know? You understand?  y'know?  I...I'm...I do things and I fuck up and I fucked up....forgive me, ok? Can you just...
Cats and Dogs out there, huh?
Ok. One of those. Do you have Ram Rod? The magazine, Ram Rod?
Yeah.
yeah, I said.  Is that it?
Be ready at two --
You ready to keep winning?
Go to it, handsome.
I didn't I'm fine, I'm fine.
I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing --
You're two fuckin' days from the record, get through this and I'II do anything for you, you just gotta get through this --
He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away, but as a man.
Wh-- Wha--
Who is he, Aramis?
Those are the words of a broken spirit.  My spirit is whole.  I have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets, and I will never believe he is my enemy.
You must reconsider this plan. Phillippe is like a child, he --
Three days.
Go on.
But -- what is he doing?
He seeks redemption.
A simple theological discussion.
D'Artagnan... Those are young Musketeers down there.  They have been weaned on our legends.  They revere us -- it is an advantage. Why don't we charge them?
Forgiveness.
Aramis... is this the way to hell?
Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that.
It's been too long.
He lies.  He is here to trap us.
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
I am so sorry!  Forgive me, I --
How did you know -- ?
All this time... I was a lost secret.  But you were hiding all your loyalty, all your love.  You were the Man in the Iron Mask.
Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation.  By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.
That is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner!
What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.
... You knew you had a double?
Forgive?!
I would not have disturbed you, Majesty, but you ordered me to keep you informed --
Yes, yes, go on.
Riots?  My people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?
Ah yes, the riots.  We have food stocks on the wharves right now, no?
How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?
You would do that, your Majesty?
Shall I leave?
We did a little digging on Jim Trudell at Sergeant Zydowski's request. He's 31, no priors, and he's been working for the military for ten years.
Bullshit...
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
It's kind of a funny coincidence, isn't it?
I didn't break in - the back door was open!
Did he harm the girl?
I was just having a little fun -
Captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office.
Who is it?
They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.
So where are you from?
I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.
Six months ago, a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note, you may have heard of it...
Have you ever heard of the Live Oak River?
No -
No...I'm in some trouble...
Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
Shit, you know what happens to me if I'm harboring a fugitive?  I already think they're on to me! I thought you were the phone police for Chrissake!
I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.
You know this time, there's nobody that's gonna cover your ass. You're over your head this time.
A bank?
That was her - the girl... We have to go.
I can't help you anymore, Jimmy. I'm sorry.
Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?
What would your - boyfriend - think?
Where am I going?
Why aren't you ever alone with him?
Because I'm professionally concerned about him. And he'd pick up on that. He's fast. He hates being prodded and poked.  So do I.  What do you want?
What have we missed?
Sidney: I don't understand him.  We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience.  To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His 'becoming'... but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming.  The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That's what's missing for me.  Why the mirrors?
The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  I don't have an answer for you.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this.
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.  He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces.  None of them knew that;
What else did you keep out of the papers?
Will... you saw this in the papers. The second one was all over TV. Did you ever think about givin' me a call?
Why not?
If you can't look anymore, I understand...
Let's talk after dinner. Stay and eat.
Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you?
Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right?  We'll get him one way or the other.
No other possibilities?
How'd you know 'broken mirrors?' Bribe a cop?  Tell it to the U.S. Attorney, Lounds!
...there's three 't's' and an 'r' in Tattler.
And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon.
What's it narrow down to?
There has to be.
We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in.  They're in the far corner of the room under the windows.
Is that you. D?
Yes, are you okay...?!
Do you want a Coke or something, Reba?
My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned.
Do you feel privileged?
'No' what?
Not me.
Come in.
Can you read it to me?
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tenth and Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C.
This is Will Graham. Can I help you?
He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet.
That's all we know about.  Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior.  You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin...  He bites a lot.
It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl.
I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
If I were?
Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
Will? Are you okay?
Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you.
It's what Kevin called her when he was little...
I came up here after Kevin's father died.  They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too.
What's that?
I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.
There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for. They transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
Meet point's up ahead!
Go on to the house.
My name's Will Graham. I...
Yeah...
Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
...after a while.
Of course, you don't.  I'm glad you came. My callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. Second-raters, the lot.
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
You read about it, I'm sure.
No.
You should, Will. God's terrific!  He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn.  Don't you think that felt good?  He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders.
Glaser Safety Slugs?
Kevlar Second Chance.
Andy... this is every comedian's dream.
But George, I like to push the boundaries...
So how can I help you...?
You know that's not what I meant! Look, I'm gonna put my foot down! No more playing alone.  You wanna perform, you GOTTA have an audience!
Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we knew, you were DYING!  Look at your mother -- she's still shaking!
What do you mean?
Hey, I hope you didn't take that stuff I said seriously.  It was just part of the show!  It's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd.
Do you wanna to go to Memphis and get married?
But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough...
It's probably just a strained muscle.
No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
Who is this? TONY CLIFTON  You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear.  Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.
That was a really hot house!
Why...?  Andy, why...?
It's a perfect Kaufman audience.
Is he in his room?
Where?
Are you tryin' to do some of that Polack humor?  Well if that's so, you can just get the hell out of this restaurant!
We'll need a search running.
You don't know.
The great Morpheus.  We meet at last.
Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --
I sent two units.  They're bringing her down now.
You're two hours late.
Don't be ridiculous.
Don't tell me you're a believer now?
Do you always look at it encoded?
I'm going to let you in on a little secret here.  Now don't tell him I told you this, but this ain't the first time Morpheus thought he found the One.
Hello?
This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson.
And she knows what?  Everything?
Morpheus, the Oracle... she told me --
How...?!
Hello?
That vase.
So?  What do you think?  You think you're the One?
I know.  Poor Morpheus.  Without him we are lost.  We will never find the One.
Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
That was a long time ago.
Neo, please, you have to trust me.
But an Oracle can.
Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!
Why?
No, you're not.
The last human city.  The only place we got left.
What do they want?
Operator.
Which way?  Which way?
We need an exit!
Tank, you're hurt.
Yeah.  But he ain't here now.
Great...great...listen, I'm very interested in you guys because I'll be opening a new club myself soon... uptown...and maybe we can work something out...
Look fella...this is private...
Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth...
Well, we got $40, and we wanna buy...
Well, we want good stuff.
And cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets?
Why?
Look at her.
Where to?
I know, I know, stupid.  I mean where you goin'?
Yeah.
Take it easy.  I only asked because maybe I could, you know, let you have a little something.
How about Teresa?  I could talk...
The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
It's the truth, I swear.
You'd better make a move kid.  He thinks you're trying to screw him.
Wouldn't bother me.
I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid.  Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?
Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them.
Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
If you had a little talk with your uncle...if anybody can do it, he can.
Oh, cut it out, will ya?
Hey...you're here.  They told me you're here...and you're here.  How are you?
I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me.
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
Nope...
Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.
Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...?  Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok?
What's a'matter?
Charlie, this is business.
Diane, how are you feeling?
I was thinking maybe you'd do very nicely for the place.
About Oscar...I think he put on this act...about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that. He can't make the payments...I don't know what to make of it.  He says Groppi's run off with a girl. I could help if you want.
Take a drink!
Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is...
...but it's the same thing, all the same...they're in there by having something on somebody...and when that doesn't work...they fight...Our life has honor...we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do.  They know where to come when they need us.  I realize this during the war...World War II...Vito Genovese... during WWII he worked with the government, taking care of the docks...
Nothing.
No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
Sure...it's not that...I mean...
You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
Yeah...but don't worry about that now.  The Hemmingway one is first.
Sure...He lives there?
Teresa?...Yeah, Charlie.  Listen, I'm looking for your cousin.  Yeah, well today's Tuesday, payday.  I haven't seen him all day...no...well, have you got any idea where he is?  I know it's early yet but I'm just getting worried that's all...
Hey Johnny, where're you goin'?
Well...no.
Must have been all the liquor in him.
How much?
Can you spare it?
Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
What, honey?
And you could care less --
Daddy.  Does your friend have a name?
Who's Annie?
Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!
Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
Honey --!
...This shit's not bad.
-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
Red or white?
'Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter'.  You like it?
I would prefer some peanut butter.
...See you tomorrow night.
Well... goodnight.
You're taking this too far, Drew.
What side of the industry did you say you were on?
I didn't say.
Nice to see you.  I didn't expect you, but certainly you can't get enough of a good thing.
It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
No, I don't --
A voice?
I was saying to Quince we won't need --
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
As close as a deal could be.
'Joe...'
I am now.
Shall we adjourn?
For how long?  And why?
That's it?
Don't you want to hear the details?
In English, please.
I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --
I'd like to come, too.  See Susan strut her stuff.
What have you done?  You've gotten the old man fired!
I'm going to put a stop to this!
He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary.
I from dat nex' place.
No, no.  I on holiday.
I nuttin' to do wi' dat.
Schoolboy tings is you head. Badness for you, badness for her, badness for me, lyin' here tumor, big as breadfruit, poison my inners an' waiting.
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
Black.
Do I?  I'm a little confused.
Love.
'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?
Oh yes, you are one of my favorites.
-- Can't seem to escape you today.
I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
To bed.
I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood --
Nowhere?  I'm...here.
It gets worse.
We know so little about each other --
Will it?
Tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now --
Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party --
'Threw' you?  Where?
'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left- field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?
It is a deal?
What do you mean?
What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
-- What's the deal here?  Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?
Are you sad, Bill?
I thought you'd heard a trillion times --
You were just curious?
Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.
You are?
Are you threatening me?
It's time to put this person where he belongs.
I told you to shut up.
Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
Undisclosed conflict of interest --
When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.
Where are you?
'Take me'...?  Where?
'The one' to do what?
Show me around.  Be my guide.  And in return, you get...
What the hell are you talking about?
Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --
Does Drew tell you everything?
You mean like you loved Mom?
And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
Well, I wasn't going to say that --
That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
A-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears pricked.  I'm ready for action.
I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --
Because I was sitting in a staff meeting, incredibly bored, my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- Joe.
I don't understand.
Where's he going?
Are you relieved?
Why?
MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 85.
30.
Hiya.
Why didn't you clean it out?					 *
So how many rooms am I checked into in this dump?
A cop?
I like your car.
Where'd you get it?
You're making a big fucking mistake. My associates are not people you want -
Don't say anything else.
Yes.
But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.
How do I know he did that to you?
So I just take your word?
There are things you know for sure.
Such as?
No!
Kill him. I'll pay you.
Calm down.
That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
Don't say another fucking word!
Sweet.
What?
Well, that's me.
I can't make new memories. Everything			  * fades, nothing sticks. By the time we finish this conversation I won't remember how it started, and the next time I see you I won't know that I've ever met you before.
Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is "faking" anything, just that his condition can't be shown -
I'm not interested in the company position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.
I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.
Did you? I musta forgot. I'm Teddy.			    *
This is your car.
What the hell you want to go there for?
John Gammell?
Things change.
How'd ya get him in here in the first place?
Teddy. Your buddy.
Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
She has no idea who I am.
Envelopes?							    *
He knew about Sammy. Why would I tell him about Sammy?							  *
Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !				    *
Sammy was a con man. A faker.
To set yourself a puzzle you won't ever solve. You know how many towns, how many		    * guys called James G? Or John G? Shit, Leonard, I'm a John G.
Your name's Teddy.
It is now.
What was it for?							   *
Lemon doesn't go in Gin and Tonics, darlin'.  Where ya' from?
Oh, yeah...
Yeah?
Where's the new drop point...?
They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment...
My end?
Make it 40%.
When?
How fast does that go?
Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...
My cousin is the harbor master. You must not bring in drugs.  You cannot be armed.  If you're carrying, it has to go.  Or stow it inside.  No one will go near your boat...
Cost less.  That's the point.
Did Christmas come early this year...?
Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate.
Something like that.  The odds catch up with you.  The odds are like gravity.  You can't negotiate with them.  So...at some point, you should cash out, take your money and run...
When?
Would you find me...?
And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?
So?
Gina in the Miami pad.  You gonna give me phony denials?
No.
Where'd you go?
Verdado.
Yeah.  CIA-level stuff...
Hey, fuck him.
A Colombian producer.  Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.
This I gotta see...  ...the "make up an excuse and stop" part.
I gave up nothing on you guys. Don't worry.  I kept you and Rico out of it.  Only the Feds.  They're on their own...it's all their deal, anyway, so fuck 'em.
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
Oh, good...
So?
Nothing.  Calling to say hi... What's up with you?
What's it say?
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
Transshipment point is here at 17:00 hours on the 23rd.
Hers'n zodda meg a livig.
What you gonna do back there, East?
No, ma'am, I'm not.
If you didn't talk so much, maybe you could think more.
You gonna beat me, Joe?
Shee-it...  Kee-rist, you really know the ropes. Wish to hell I bumped into you before. I'm Joe Buck from Texas and I'm gonna buy you a drink, what do you say to that?
I want you to stay, okay? I goddam invited you, didn't I?
Well, I hope you know what you're in for. I'm a very dangerous person. Someone does me bad like you. If I caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead Ratso long about now. Hear?
This is an okay setup you got here, but I'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?
Hey, you're good! I bet you could pick up a living at this if you tried.
What you're driving at, you want me to get lost so you can go to your fancy-ass party.
But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.
Tell her, Ratso.
No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.
Well, I don't think I can walk.  I mean, I been falling down a lot and, uh...
What of?
I read it.
A drink? I've got some nice gin. If you'd prefer something else, they'll send it up...
Gin's okay.
What d'you want?
What you got me up here for?
Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
No, yes. No, I mean yes please go. Help me to be good. Come back tomorrow. Promise.
Gonna be like money from home.
Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right?
... and taxi fare for me.
...He had a bald skull and...
Yeah.
Two kilos.
Shit.
...Don't worry about it.  I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here.  You all right?
I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?
Yes...?
A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.
You decided to fly at a bad time Billy Palestinian Guerrillas all over the place blowing up planes and all.
Beats working.
Feeling all right?
I want you to know we're going to do everything, in our power to get you out as soon as possible. Believe me.
No... It looks like your going to have a new court.
We go back.
Cut his fucking throat.
It's already been cut.
And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.
Billy, what's the matter?
Mr. Yesil.
His name?
Who got the Frenchman out?
Okay, Jeremy...go get Dr. Chris Raymond, will you?
Did they get the sleazebag who owns this place?
Weird shit...?
Go left.  Go left again till you hit the fork... Then right again. You got that?
We'll be back at the platform in...
Its muscles are locked.
I pull.
You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.
This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts!
Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...
It didn't bite me.
The scent won't last...
C'mon...
No...
You sure you didn't see one of these?
Sure.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
The one to town is, but that's about it. I called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. I told him who you were and what had happened. He said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you.
I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that.
I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril.  How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
That's the big surprise. Your new studio--after all, writers do need a place to work.
Misery's Return?
It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie.
Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating?
What's the matter, Paul? You haven't written a word.
Paul, this is positively the best Misery you've ever written.
When you first came here, I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. But now I know I love the rest of him too. As much as Misery loves Ian.  I know you don't love me--don't say you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant, famous man of the world; and I'm...not a movie star type. You'll never know the fear of losing someone like you if you're someone like me.
What?
Now don't fuss, Paul.
Be my guest.
I know you do. I love you too, Annie.  And you're right. We are meant to be together. And I know we must die. But it must be so that Misery can live. We have the power to give Misery eternal life. We must finish the book.
Maybe.
It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what does that do to her love for Ian?--  --of course, if she hadn't thought Windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first place.  Sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful.
Could be the weight of the snow.
They're hauling Misery into court.
How many times do I have to tell you-- I have a system here.  Where the hell is that thing?
It's good you found it.
Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
No, no, of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him...
We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.
Great.
I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.
Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks.
- right -  - don't go too far ahead of me now -
One considers her timing, of course - getting nicked within a week of the plane going down.  Suggestive, even borderline suspicious, but hardly conclusive.
How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me?
I said you're beautiful, Nyah.
Good.  Biocyte stock is just a week or two away from going through the roof.
Where?
There it is, guys, the last of it.
She doesn't belong here, Sean.  Let her go.
Oh, Hunt, please! One can't hold Nyah responsible for her actions..
Not exactly.  Wallis?
It is, Billy.
Ambrose obviously got these from Nekhorvich on the plane.
How're we doin', then?
If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
Pull over and listen to me, will you? Just listen..
I need your help and I thin you can use mine.
Awfully short notice..
They've got a book for everything.
Which is?
I'd like a little more conviction..
How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.
Just like old times.
No.  Should I?
Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
Why did you phrase it like that?
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't.
We think we've got our finger on the buyer.
- good.  Then if you manage to get hold of Ambrose, and obtain what he's got, you've got -  - 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty-three seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of Chimera on earth.
Something else?
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
..not in time to save him.
..I'm fine..and you?
Let's start from the inside out.
Thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop.
His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No- one gets off.  High security.  Good place for a pass off to Max.
Krieger.
Sarah's reconsidering.  Claire, transport in five minutes.
You were in the car!
Take off your coat.
What?
Did they send you...Did they send you?
Who sent you?!  Who sent you?
Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
Okay...
Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?
Of course - Iím sorry to hear you say that Claire.
This stuff is so sticky.
Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Donít disappoint me.
We've lost enough agents for one night.
What?
That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314".  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
I see you've been out visiting the folks.
Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses.
What makes you trust me?
Sure.  They want me back in so I won't break in!  They <i>still</i> can't figure out how we did it.
I need one hundred thousand dollars.
Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
Why should I?
Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.
How will you make sure Job will be there?
Zero body count.
Merci.
Claire.
Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Iím coming to you.
Would you remove your hat please?
Why?
Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say.
A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want.  <u>After</u> this one.
What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too.
Hey, I showed 'em to you!
..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself.  Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - <i>without your permission</i>.  The son-of-a- bitch!  How <i>dare</i> he?  You realize itís over, youíre an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, youíve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year.  Kittridge, weíll go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time!
Such a nice ass.
Try it again.
The Shawfish?
I don't wanna talk about it.
Where you been?
Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married?
I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
I don't know what you mean.
Where's Ma?
Maybe.
So you'll come to the wedding, right?
You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp!
It's wrong to just let them go.
Yeah, this is Ronny.
Yes. Do you want...
I know that. I do what I want.
Stop it!
I was dead.
I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again.
What?
I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
Kinda gaudy.
Yeah.
What do you want to do now?
What's the matter?
You're late!
I'm really afraid.
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
In time, you will see that this is the best thing.
I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny.
Thanks. What's the matter with you?
Are you drunk?
Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession.
I know.
Don't fight.
I will. But I must find the right moment.
So.
Where is she?
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
Have you come to make peace with me?
Because my mother was dying! But now she's not.
Yes?
May I presume to ask you a question?
What happened?
My lady friend has a personality disorder.
Yes.
I'm freezing
It's a house.
What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon.
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
You were a tiger last night.
She's got it.
There are?  Tell up.  What are they, wise Sir Bedevere?
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
Dennis! There's some lovely filth down here ...  Oh! how d'you do?
Order, eh -- who does he think he is?
You don't vote for kings.
NI!
What is that?
I cannot tell you.  Suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!
You said it again!
Come on then.
Look!
Stop that.
Of course not!  You are English pigs.
What is your name?
... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.
Je...sus Christ!
:I'm thirty-seven ... I'm not old.
Yes.
Shut up!
I'm averting my eyes, Lord.
To find the Holy Grail.
I dunno, Must be a king.
I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.
You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost me a fortune!
Herbert ...  We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get.
But I don't like her.
If we ... er ... 
No ... just keep him in here.
And make sure he doesn't leave.
Oh ... hello ...
Come Sir Galahad, quickly!
Oh, let me go and have a bit of peril?
No.  It's unhealthy.
Well,  what seems to be the trouble?
I done it again.
I didn't.
Prince Leopold?  Is he the one who bleeds all day?  So what does his valet do?  Wash his poultices for him?
So?  Someone'll send it on ahead.
Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
The place is a mess.
I see.
But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --
I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.
Nobody has any rights over me.
Occasionally.
To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
Forgive me, I've called you out and you should have been resting.
Oh.
To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
But yourself?  What about John Brown?
See what?
Yes, ma'am.
If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two.
Aye, ma'am.
Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
We took a nip of whiskey.
Yes, ma'am.
For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!
Your Majesty remains at the very epicenter of governance.  As for your people, look no further than the sales of your Highland Journals to see in what affection the nation holds their Queen.  You sell even more copies than Mr Dickens.
Yes.
Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?
Not too protracted, I hope.
I'm sorry, ma'am?
No.  You are mistaken.  Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever.  I asked what was wrong with my son.
I made no request to go out riding today.  How long has he been there?
Please make sure it does not happen again.
Your Majesty --
There is one other matter.
What is it?
From whom?
He is sick, ma'am.
Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important.
If this is a joke, I'm not laughing.
Talk to me.
What's her problem?
I came from the city on the left.
We are talking...
I'm in the middle of it...
Happy?
See, men always do this.  "Quiet down, honey.  Chill out.  Take a Valium". I'm not a fucking idiot, Nick!  I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!!
...but then it hits the relay stations...
The Police, then...
SLIP-STREAM.
You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.
You got the schematics?
Dante's Inferno.
Yes I am...
You don't get it, do you?
I'll take the lead and handle the physical threats.  You watch the elapsed time and look for exits.
What the fuck is that?!
We can't reach that!
So what do you think?
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
I know.  Where are you Adam?
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?
Yeah.
I agree with what you said...truly.
It will work out.
So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?
I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
I think so. I was just taking a shower.
Hi. I'm inquiring ...well, I heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
I think I've been hurt.
But, this could be serious.
No.... I don't...
Strange to be calling yourself.
"You're still here?"
"You're playing a dangerous game here. If you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work."
"Stop! Just Stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before..."
Oh, no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to fix a sandwich. You want one?
When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
Those men in front, in the car.
Betty Elms.
Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.
Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along the shoulder ... man up the road said he saw two cars drag racin'...then you got that blind corner.
Yeah ... and they both use the same address.
A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
Is that it ?
I'm an investment banker. I see blood bathes everyday. Besides, mine is not to question why, min is but to do or die.
Why should we trust you ?
Now where do we go ?
Come on, it works.
I'm working on it.
First Bank ? But how ?
What are you doing ?
Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.
I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
NO ! I wouldn't do that.
He hired you to build this place ?
You okay ?
If we can get to through the next room, we'll be at a junction for a power grid.
What about you ?
Are you Matthew Parker ?
Give me one good reason why I don't plug you right here, right now ? 
The room has sound sensors. If you wake it up, it breathes fire.
He's the liaison for McCay. Listen go. Go now.
But, he's...
Stop the hydraulics.
Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?
He probably has a history of this shit.
Excuse me, sir ?
Perhaps it was. I was in boarding school for so many years, it's hard to remember. Do you have the tape of the latest exploits from my favorite hobby ?
I have to say, that I am glad you are such an amazing kiss ass.
What if we were to put Bruce into the Park as a Guest ?
Sir, he created the Park. He would know how to circumvent any of the traps.
What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
Zachary.
Yes sir. It will be the best of your collection, I assure you.
Fantastic ! A little faster sweetheart.
Bruce has just awaken.
Look ! Look !
<<belch>>
What happened ?
Do you want to go out with me ?
Not now, Mom.
He was right behind me !
Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago.
I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....
You had to remind me?
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not even nuns.
This is California, anything is possible.
What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
I don't think you're very polite.
So charge him with something...who's gonna know?
Pommeroy.
Pommeroy...he may or may not be driving a black 54 Ford Pickup.  Monday.
I'm leaving Sunday.
You want me to move?
Well you know what I mean.
Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.
So you're saying...What are you saying??
I already bought a ticket.
I will. How's Shelly?
I love you too sweetie, bye.
Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.
Oh, she's fine, she'll love her new room.
We have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and I chose my mother. She was born in Los Angeles and since my uncle Phil moved out here I came in to visit him and then I looked at her high school yearbook and...  and I called a few people and one guy said that she went to UCLA, another guy said that I should call Hillary Mitchell so....
More than anything in the world.
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
Well...
It's just a corpse.
See you? He can smell you from there.
So she had you in jail, in Russia?
Hello.
This is really very nice of you.
Hi there...can I help you?
Nicholas! What are you doing up?
I want juice!
MOM!
No THANKS!
They obviously have no sense of historical perspective either.
Get married?
Does it work?
Where are you going???
You mean,  this ring?
I'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.
What's he smoking?
What do you think?
Yeah I guess...sort of.
Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
It's not his fault!
What's that?
What's it for?
Wow!
Well I know you're not crazy about taking Vada around tomorrow, so...I just want you to know I appreciate it though.
How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
You want me to come with?
No, you're the best and I don't want you talking to anybody on the plane.
He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
Phil for God sake.
Oh, yeah, sure, help yourself.
Wait, are you saying that I don't appreciate?
Yes, I do.
Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
No. You know they say, that it never rains, that you can barbecue on Christmas day...instead of riding your bike, you just surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the place is just crawling with celebrities. I know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up his dry-cleaning.
But what about you and the baby? You need me.
He's so tiny.
You're such a baby.
Danny?
It's there.
Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....
What do you mean??
Oh that, she just likes to play.
Hi.
Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.
Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.
What happened to her?
What are you wearing?
Kiss me.
Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
Yep, there they are... They always look the same every year...
Dad?
I love this guy! 
Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.
Is that the fish you won at the carnival?
Why not?
He was allergic to bees.
He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!
Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.
Oh yes, oh that's great.
No, no no....
Sure.
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
Mr. Bixler,  I love you.
Who's that?
Do you like her?
Who's winning?
My ball, I lost my ball.
No, I'm divorced.
Sure.
Do you like putting makeup on people?
I like my name.
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
How old are you?
It's actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn't have been a Vada.
Oh great!
I'm trying.
If I do it, can we go?
No.
Who's that with your Dad?
But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?
They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids.
We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
Hey Vada, guess what we got?
What?
I am running faster!!
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
No, I'm hiding out.
Hi Vada, can you come out?
No.
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
Say something it's too quiet.
What?
I honestly wish I could...
Blood oath.
I noticed.  I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons.

What?
Hi! Star.
I won first prize.
Yes. I'm cutting a record.
Well, I guess you caught me at a weak moment.
What's wrong with her.
Thank you-- Yes, I am.
What do you really want?
You bet.
Need to have you check these out before he goes on that Walker benefit.
Well, Mr. Green.
I'm fine. Can I go up?
Well, don't be shy. I got the address here. Anytime you need it. Room's twenty-five dollar! a week and you can have breakfast with me if you like.
You know anything about the stations here?
How do you know?
Well I've been following him around Just listening to him --He says he can really win -- I bet he can too - -
Well, he's really amazing.
Ah, hello. My name is Kenneth Fraser... And I'm here from Terre Haute, Indiana. Ah, listen ... somebody stole my handles.
Parts.
Oh... Well.
Well, I got to Nashville. That's pretty far.
Green?  Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled money from your grandfather
He doesn1t have fungus, does he?
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
Bye.
Linnea?
Yes. Who's this?
Tom. You remember?
Yes.
Who is this?  It's Tom.
Who is this, right?  I called you last night.
Older.
Just got out. Had me thirteen lawyers. Missed the electric chair twice. .. Been out three months. Are you heavy?
Fifteen minutes?
Hello.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Sleeping.
Come on back to bed.
Well, I really think he's got a chance.
Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?
I know a couple.
Who?
I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?
Yes you are.
The style of fighting that Tim studied didn't believe in belts.
That means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I correct on that point?
The key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste.
What did you think then?
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
Look, our situation in a nutshell is, no prison wants 'em, no prison will take 'em. I'm even talkin' hellholes, where the warden's as hard as a bar of iron. No one wants those fuckin' assholes behind their walls, dealin' with 'em day in, day out.
Lobotomy Bay?
Ready.
Hello Mickey. We've never been introduced, but I'm Wayne Gayle. I don't know if you've ever heard of me or remember me. I was one of the reporters outside the courthouse during your trial---
Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
Mickey, how do you feel about cross- examining Grace Mulberry?
Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question.
This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
If they stay, they'll catch you, and they don't have to catch you---
Mickey, you're wasting time!
How can you say that you 'admire' them?
They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.
He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---
Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County Jail. Julie, just park in the front.
Wayne---
Roger?
Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be together. So, we'll put you on one of our prison busses and you'll take Mallory first, then you'll come back for Mickey.
Wayne Gayle.
When do you want the assembly?
Okay, boys, let's have it.
Rollin'...and speed!
But you'll never be whole again.
I'm the superintendent here at L.A. County Jail. Me and my deputies are who you'll be working with while you're here.
Really?
Lose 'em.
Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure I know 'em better than you do.
Wayne, if it was anybody else---
Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?
Could we go with you and film it?
Yeah.
Give her a beer.
Who's going to buy me a beer?
Fill her up?
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
That's right.
Want to keep your job, boy?
Yeah.
Where was that?
What did you say your name is?
Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
James Lee, you come in here and meet your daddy.
Where's Wilma?
Well, she never gave me none. Look, you better find him a place pretty quick.
His profession?
Any other family?
Yeah, I been there.
I'm a teacher.
You don't think much of yourself, do you?
Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?
No, on the porch.
No.
What about that girl?
He could live with us.
Uh-huh. Why?
How would you like to have a baby, Duff?
Huh?
Man, we sure hit the jackpot fast around here.
When I get set, I'll send for you.
Where' you goin'?
We was just leavin', fellows.
That's right.
Wouldn't have known you.
'Don't sound so sure.
That's right.
Come back some other time, will you?
I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
Okay.
It's hard to know how to talk to the white folks these days.
I guess I ain't.
Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want.
You'll be in trouble, son.  Now just how do you intend to support your family?
If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.
Got a thick feelin' here.
I fucking hate Raoul.  Shut the fuck up, asshole! someone.
I'm still on my honeymoon.
Let me get you another glass of wine.
Security breach. Perhaps her friends have come to join our party.
Easy...
You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.
You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is.
The corporate plundering of Yeshoto Industries... At first these seemed like unrelated incidents, but a pattern is emerging that suggests otherwise.
Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
What are you talking about?
Fried Air Tram in the process. Not to mention half my gear.
Prepping your trip.
Are you even really alive?
You're pleasant tonight.
Hey, bro.
Yeah. That was me.
Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it.
What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.
What?
Doesn't look like much, but that's King Hell ice, man. Fry your brain out soon as look at you.
How's the ice break?
What about the route to the core?
What?
Why did you come here tonight, Linda?
You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.
I hope you can show more than you did when you let the Yakuza butcher Linda Lee.
I know who he isn't. Not C.I.A. Not Sense/Net. But... money comes in. Doors open. He's onto something.
Maybe something's onto him.
How soon is soon enough?
I'll show you how to tell what's going on. If things go south, you unplug me.
On a good run... yeah.
The first fun's bound to be rough. It that read out fluctuates more than ten points... just pull this out. But if the EEG flatlines, don't touch anything.
The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.
Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
...Feels like you.
Case... it's four a.m.
I know.
Once I kicked, I swore I wouldn't let that happen again. I apprenticed a razor girl in Osaka. Went into hock for the implant and got my reflexes jacked up. Been taking care of myself just fine ever since.
Is he going to make it?
Get up.
I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
What is with this school and prom?
Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.
It's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.
Oh, man! Who told?
YOU DID.
Guess who I did it with last night...
Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
Okay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear.
Okay. That's bad.
You've done five of my ideas.
You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.
It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
He's my teacher!
Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.
Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal.
No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.
Better person than I.
I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
It was a long time ago -
No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.
Jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore.
Look, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?
Are you crazy?! You can't do this.
Whoa. Deja Vu.
Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
Please. Please don't walk away.
Hey Monty--you think we'll get any business today?
Wow - I-
Where're we taking him?
You're mine, you know.  I made you.
Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
But I have to go out. Something's happening out there.
When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.
He's conducting experiments of his own.
You got your room straightened out yet?
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
So, you live around here.
Oh Jesus.  I'm gonna be sick.
Jesus Christ, you scared the shit out of me!
What?
Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
You know her?
Like a haunted house, right?  I don't believe in ghosts.
Any ghosts in here?
Yeah?
Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?
Hi, guys.
Yor dad picking the music again?
We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night.
I'll need to take her things.
I'll get it.  Please, I don't mind.
Watching TV.
I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
I gotta stay up, Max.
Horseshit.
I know who's trying to kill you.
What's that?
I think we can stop him this time. Stop him for good.  But we need to know where the bones were hidden.
It's over.  It's over.
You'll get to meet them all tomorrow. They're...survivors.  In a way.  All severely sleep disordered.  Insomnia, narcolepsy, bedwetting...
Right.  They seem to share a group delusion,  a "boogeyman" for lack of a better word.  They're so traumatized, they'll do anything not to sleep.
I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.
Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
Call me Nancy.
Didn't get much sleep.
This is nice.
The nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems.
For what?
We made it.  Neil, we made it!
Take it slowly.  Remember, this is a dream. Anything is possible.
I've heard crazier things this week.
How do we get in?
There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
The whole facility was shut down in the Forties, wasn't it?  Some kind of scandal...
A young girl on the staff was accidentally locked in here over the holidays.  The inmates managed to keep her hidden for days.  She was raped...hundreds of times. When they found her, she was barely alive...and with child.
You said something before...about laying him to rest...?
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
This is stupid.
In the name of Elric, Prince of Elves, demon begone.
Now you're lying.
No!
We are living in cloudcuckooland -- we'll never get this done today.
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
Films mainly.
I think the man who wrote it has actually been to Turkey, which helps. There's also a very amusing incident with a kebab.
No.
No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help.
I apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment.  Disaster...
Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
Okay.
It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.
You've got to go.
These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...
'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the Pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I'll pelt you with olives.
'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'
Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.
What do you think?
You like Chagall?
No.  What's that?
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea.
I haven't decided.
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
Does the girl have a name?
This painting isn't the original, is it?
But she said she wanted to go out with you?
Is this your first film?
Me?
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
Right, right.  Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?
Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.
I suppose so.
I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...
Buggered?
Any more announcements?
Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
Hello.
Imagine -- somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.
Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
Who were the ones you didn't write down from?
Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
Right.  No one else?
I'm going to throw out these old videos.
Excuse me.
Yes.
I haven't got a book down my trousers.
No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open...
Yes, Mister Harding?
Was it your idea to visit her on Sunday?
Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!
Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
Sh-sh-she did! Everybody did!
Easy now, don't smudge 'em, we got lots of games ahead of us...
Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse.
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
Sorry to have bothered you.
Mister McMurphy, patients are not permitted to run around in towels.
Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group therapy.
But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.
You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
B-B-Billy.
W-W-We h-heard y-you w-were n-never c-c-coming back!
Ahhh, Billy...
Shit, Rose! What's there to decide? There's only four of us.
Go with him, Rose. Go with him.
They went that way.
When do you think we'll be going back, Mack?
I'll bet a dollar.
Martini!
Well, say, buddy, is that the usual pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a peckin' party?
Hell, I couldn't get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me!
A baseball game isn't worth the risk, my friend.
I'm the coach!
No!
Psst! Hey, Martini, wake up!
Yeah, Mac?
I wanna go home!
My turn.
Hell, Doc, I've been everything from a hoopla man with a two-bit carny show to a top mechanic and bull goose catskinner for every gypo loggin' operation in the Northwest till the Army taught me what my natural bent was.
Oh, what was that?
Well, according to the Warden at Pendleton, you were a disturbing influence on others. 'It appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates.'  What do you think of that report?
How are you feeling?
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
Pardon me miss, but would you mind turning...
I'm the next one.
What's going on?
Yeah, we'll miss breakfast!
Scanlon! Hey, Scanlon, wake up!
I thought I told you boys to go to bed!
Okay. How you doing?
Hi.
Hit, you say? Well well well and with a king up, the boy wants a hit. Whadaya know. So comin' at you and too bad, a little lady for the lad and he's over the wall and down the road, up the hill and dropped his load.
Yes, I see it! I see it!
Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall day...
Hey, Sam, bet ya two bucks ya lose.
We got your black ass now, Washington, wanna bet another twenty?
Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.
That!
Smells like piss. Is this real, Candy? Is this really real? I mean we are in an insane asylum, an' I wanna know how we got ourselves into this scene.
I thought so.
Oh, yeah...
Your mother.
May I see your boarding pass, please?
Great.  Because, like I said, until you find it, we can't let you on the plane.
So, what's the story with your friend?
--separate, in the evening..."
It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.
You're sure...
No...
Nothing you could say would change the way I feel.
What's mezzaluna?
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
It was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it?  I knew that was too much.
Thanks.
This is his fiancee.  Who's this?
You're limping.
So?!  Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
I went back to that restaurant and I spoke with his waiter, just on an off chance, you know, and, anyway-- he knew the name of the guy's hotel.  So, I called there, they said he left yesterday.  But, apparently he comes here every year, always follows the same route.  He always goes from here down the coast to the Le Sirenuse hotel in Positano.  I called.  And they told me he's checked in.
Uh, I'd rather not say.
Tell me.
I'd really rather not say.
Oh, thanks.  Well, have a good time.
I'm sorry.
I can't believe you did that!
Very funny.
No.  He smokes.
So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I.  But we work it out.  We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other.  I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome.
But one day you wake up and realize you've been had.  Of course life isn't like the movies.  That's why there are movies.
Because you were afraid to fly.
Are you sure?
Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
I told you a liter was less than a gallon.
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
What's that supposed to mean?...
Hi-iii...
Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
Packing.
A little bad luck?
I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.
Whatareyoudoing?!
And he is living proof.
And you are?...
Right.
Right now?
Well, where are they?
What do you mean, odd? We was robbed like I told you.
What gives with our boy tonight, Charley? He ain't himself.
When he got up and chased them they thought it was a dead man coming after them.
Drink up, Charley. We're ahead of you.
But my own kid bro—
I figured the worst they'd do is work him over a little.
We got a little extra detail for you. The local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church. We'd like a rundown on it. You know, names and numbers of all the players. You're nominated.
The complete works of Timothy J. Nolan.
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.
Boss loader!
—ex-tanker who's walking on his heels— ?
Wow... .
It was you, Charley... .
Edie, I do what I can. I'm in the church when you need me.
Father Barry.
Aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.
Now you got me! It's a wonder I wasn't punchy by the time I was twelve. The rulers those Sisters used to whack me with!  They thought they could beat an education into me—I foxed 'em.
Listen, Edie, am I going to see you again?
I don't know.
The things that go on.
Listen, you like beer?
What a fruitcake you are!
Look out for number one. Always number one.  I should've known you wouldn't tell me. Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you. I think he still owns you.  No wonder everybody calls you a bum.
It's true.
Edie!
I don't rate it.
Who says?
What I did to Joey.
I had to, Edie. I had to see you.
It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
Charley.
I'll take it out of their skulls.
Terry, for God's sake.
Edie.
He wasn't Abyssinian, Pop, Assyrian... .
Pop, don't think I'm not feeling grateful for all you've done to get me an education and shelter me from this.  But now my eyes are open. I see things I know are so wrong how can I go back and keep my mind on things that are only in books and that people aren't living? I'm staying, Pop. And I'm going to keep on trying to find out who's guilty for Joey. I'd walk home with a dozen Terry Malloys if I thought they could help me. I tell you I'm staying, Pop. Pop starts to pull his belt out of his trousers.
Someone else c'n take your confession.
A question of who rides who.
How much is your soul worth if you don't?
Good luck.
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
You can!
I told you I don't know nothin' and I ain't saying nothin'.
If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him— boy, I was ready that night.
You're doin' lovely, Terry, very lovely.
Better.
He's got his nerve, gum-shoeing around here after what you told him.
Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug somebody put on somebody... .  You think I should turn him in?
Not a dent.  Perfect
I— I was just on my way up, Johnny.
How'd you get that.
You want to know something? Take the heater away and you're nothin'— take the good goods away, and the kickback and the shakedown cabbage away and the pistoleros—  —away and you're a great big hunk of nothing—  Your guts is all in your wallet and your trigger finger!
I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
A dime. One thin dime for a cup of coffee.
Listen— Nolan—
If I could get my hands on you...
No.  It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
I'm getting the jitters! Let's turn back!
Look!
Those creatures..!
Yes I feel it in my bones.
A situation easily remedied.
...And what is this?
She came to us on the Day of the Dead.
Ahh, she will be yours.
I would have time for my own pleasures!
You had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
Ahh, the curiousity of youth... on the road to ruin!  May it ever be so adventurous!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?
Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.
Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
Lie face down on the floor.
You didn't visit him in prison.
But you spoke to him on the phone.
He'd call every once in a while.
You did work for Emil, right?
I don't know where he is.
Listen, I'm the one help Jack escape from prison.  He tole me, I can't find him to see you.  So why don't you open this fucking door.  Okay?  So we can speak.
That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's waiting with the other car.
Wait a minute.  Let me have your raincoat.  Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes.
You want to take her to my place and get cleaned up?  You come out of the bathroom with your after-shave on and she goes, "Oh, I had you all wrong"?
Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
Her phone's probably tapped.
I'm a tourist.
I guess Adele's in good hands.
They know where I live, I guess they know what I drive, so maybe we should pick up another car on the way.
"Fight over tuna casserole may have spurred slaying."  Seems this woman's live-in boyfriend, seventy years old, complained about her tuna noodle casserole and she shot him in the face with a twelve-gauge.  Police found noodles in the woman's hair and think the guy dumped the casserole dish on her before she shot him.  They'd been together ten years.
How long you talk to her?
Yeah?  You think he'll let us in, we got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole with us?
You ever wear one of these?
What?
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
And then they'll kill 'em.
Jack --
Hello, Daniel.
I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.
Yes, but I want to hear you tell it. Starting with when you tried to grab the wheel -- where was this?
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
Karen.  Where are you?  I been trying to get a hold of you.
Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to bring in Chirino, would you put me on the task force?
Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force.
Yeah, why?
No, I didn't know that.
Christ, I know Snoopy Miller.  He's a fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard.  Hangs out with a couple other Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.
Karen, I told you not to--
It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?
Like being back in the yard, huh?
Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit and leaves his wallet on the floor.
Not until recently.
Buddy.  That's his given name?
Of course I am.
You don't act like it.
What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
Uh-huh.
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
I never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick.
You did?
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
I don't think it works if we're somebody else.  You know what I mean?  Gary and Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about anything?
I want you to know something.  I wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking.
You getting serious on me now?
He got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check.  Like that, fifty mil, signed his name.  Whoa-- little help here!
Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on.
You think he's lying?
In the trunk?
Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?
Looks like tonight.
Thanks for your help.
Really?
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down there.
You goin' right back to work?
The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
The <u>ninth</u>?
And is Foley a part of this?
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
Really?
You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.
Right now, son.
Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you don't have to give me no tone of voice, okay?  You don't like what I'm saying, you can get out anywhere along here you want.
That was some shit, huh?
How you know that?
What's wrong with you?
No.
Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much.  I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?
He's about to.
What're you doing at Glades?
Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights.
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
He doesn't even look like that.
He waved to you?
Out for the evening?
That Bausch & Lomb Saline shit you asked for is gonna be eighty bucks.
Are those <i>my</i> suits?
Now listen, it's hands off Billy.  I mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours.
I don't buy that hot dog shit.  So you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to Haleiwa.
I th-think I'm gonna like it here.
Shit, he's puking on my feet!
Well, you p-puked on his feet.
The Colonel helped me work it out.
Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.
Why be sorry?  That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.
Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.
Don't blame her, Rafe.  It's not like you're thinking.
She said I was so much like you.  I said, No, I'm not.  I'm like I am because of you, but I'm not you, not as good as you. Everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder.  But you saw the better part of me, the part of me that could be like you, and changed me. You made me who I am.
This ain't a little feud, Earl, it's World War Two!
Maybe just trying to measure up.
How's everything?
That's bullshit, son.  But it's really good bullshit.
Bombers.
Boxin'.
Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
Oh, this is Betty.
Maybe not.  But I need you to know.  I love you.  And I will come back.  I'll find a way.  And then we'll get a chance to know if what I felt the first moment I saw you, and every minute since then, is real.
I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew.  You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.
How did you?...
It's been...so different, being so sure you were dead.
It's not your fault, Rafe.  The letter I wrote you, they --
Rafe... No.  You forgive me.
Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it.
So you join us, Admiral.  Some of us thought your education at an American university would make you too weak to fight the Americans.
It's gonna rain again. Every time I wash the car, it rains.
It's your grandma's strudel that's kept this family together.
Carol!
1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun.
Hi, Peggy. God, that Walter Getz	can still dance.
The only one?
It's that jerk Walter.
What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
I hear she does more than talk with her mouth.
Charlie, how are you?
You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!
Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?
Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore.
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
It couldn't be me.  I hardly knew him.
You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
Hello, Charlie.
Fine.  ) Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.
What're you doing here anyway?
This is great reefer.
The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
That would be impossible.
You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.
It's not Charlie. It's me.
At my age? Don't be silly.
Thank God for that.
Do you know how ridiculous you sound? First of all, it's illegal for U.S. citizens to buy gold. And in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government.
That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into.
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
Ta da! Pantyhose! The death of the garter belt! Of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this. What do you think?
I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -—how could you do that?
Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
When did you start drinking coffee?
Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him?
Who was that man?
Is Charlie pressuring you to do things you don't think you should be doing?
Isn't that awfully forward?
Don't eat the red ones.
I remember when you got that locket, too. You were so excited I think you showed it to the whole school.
Not to me they don't. I'm going to win the State, then the. Nationals, and then I'm going to the Olympics.
Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now.
What was?
I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
I have to talk to you. It's very important.
I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
I	know what a burrito is.
You have a blind grandfather. One day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. I read about it. You're going to be famous. You're going to invent a lot of things.
Okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible.
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help!
You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three.  We'll start with something easy. What is your name?
Silicon is from sand.
In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her?
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
I was building a doggy door.
What?
You took over for Doctor Yolander?
He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.
What do they do up there?
What happened to you?
You nervous? New town, new school. I know it must be pretty hard for you...
What?
I think so.
Just out.
Geoff, dinner's ready!  Geoff?!
You think my Dad'll figure out why he's not getting better?
How long have you been here?
I don't know what to do, Bob.
This time. What about next time?
Hold still. Shit.  The goddamn vein's clotted. We have to go the goddamn hospital, so they can change the goddamn catheter.
I'm not going to die.
It is, and it isn't, Charles. Macrosystem's new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos' spreadsheet program. If they're allowed to sell it, Kronos will get undersold right out of business. For me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement.
Take it easy, Walter.
It's okay. Can I sit down?
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
Your... lover?
Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.
Continue.
I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
Rayisha.
Uh huh...
What have you prayed for?
We proceed, representing your estate.
I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...
I'll look over the Q and A.
Particularly, Charles.
He was... the kind of person I thought I wanted to be.
What kind of person is that?
In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay?
I'm an excellent lawyer.
Yes. On my torso.
I'm late, I have to pick up Amy from her afterschool but I want to talk to you about that Hansen thing.
Not unnecessary ones.
While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?
As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?
In some situations.
You could have infected him, isn't that right?
Hello?
Miss Burton? Do you still work at Wyant Wheeler?
Apparently, Mr. Wheeler felt they were too... "ethnic" is the word she used. She said he would like it if I wore something smaller, less garish, and... more "American."
Objection!
You had contact with someone who has AIDS, and you're worried.
Okay, Mr. Laird. Explain this to me like I'm a four year old: Did Andrew Beckett win your lawsuit for you or not?
We won.
Good school. What year?
Would you like to have a drink with me? I just finished a game, I could use a beer.  I don't pick up people in drug stores every day.
What's the matter with you? Do I look gay to you?
Relax? I ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you!
You load the film... ? No, on this side... or this side? Don't move the baby!
Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?
I'll see you in an hour, max.
Right.
Now that you mention it...
How did you do that?
I <u>know</u> the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.
Let's continue.
I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to...
Probably okay to talk to me now.
Oh, Lord....
Tell me about the sounds. You told them you heard something right before....  If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take another crack at it -- at your skull.
All you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, I'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.
Back to the ship, huh?
You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
What do my eyes see?
Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee.
Christ, you don't know what's out there!
How many bottles?
Let's move.  Just a detour. He'll get us there.
Hey, who?
S'matter?
Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
...I don't play that...I don't play that so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell me a better lie....
Let's just be sure.
Let's board this up and get the hell gone. They seem to stick to the dark, so if we stick to daylight, should be all --
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
He'll lead you over the first cliff. You know that, don't you?
So you noticed too?
We aren't completely stupid.
You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
Owens!
So quiet. You get used to the sounds of the ship, then....
Some prophet guy?
What?
Blessing you like the others.  It's painless.
'Cuz you don't spend half your life in lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth and not believe. And you surely don't start out in a liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck and not believe. Oh, absolutely I believe in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker.
Said "looks clear."
Such as.
Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.
So which one caught your eye?
What, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?
He exceeded his orders. His travel permit was promptly revoked.
We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll?  'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him.'
Where does the river lead?
If there's any shooting, Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to die. Depend on it.
Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him?
'I am not a missing link.'
How did it go?
Taylor -- quit riding him.
That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
That's true, Dr. Zaius. My witnesses -- correction -- my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater.
Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?
Did you see that? It's remarkable!
He's trying to form words.
What signal?
There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
Climb off me, will you!
Scarecrows?
I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.
Gorilla hunters ...
You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
With one of them.
What about it?
A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
Tell him to pull back!
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why?
What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.
Taylor, please --
Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
Blood trail just keeps going and going but no body.
How the hell did he get away?
Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
Says he can't walk.
Say I can dig it. Smoke that shit everything kinda gets weird y'know?  Y'hear that story the gooks is putting chemicals in the grass so's we become 'pacifists' so's we don fight  Where the hell's everybody, they'se gettin high that's what - bunch of hopheads, they think they special...
Rhah! What's going on. Rodriguez's hole just got...
Hey take it easy man. They're scared.
Yeah. No pain in my neck now. Feels good.
Barnes got it in for you, don't he?
Three years, Jesus, he's crazy as Barnes...
So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
Why the fuck didn't you do something Lieutenant!
Merle?
Tennessee someplace. Hill country.
Vancouver, B.C.
Or Reno?  They always throw them off the bridge there, I've heard.
Where are you staying in Vancouver Royal. It's pretty crowded you know.
A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for?
Indefinitely?
Nice room. Balcony and everything. Lovely view too.
No thanks?
Thank you.
I'm supposing.
The brush-off, huh?
I see.
It might be worth a Martini to you.
What did you say his name was?
You don't sound as if you liked him very much.
Go ahead...if you want to. It doesn't matter.
So there is. You don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. Let's go somewhere and hear some music--have something to drink-- something to eat--even dance.
Dance? Tonight?
Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.
Is this the best you can do?
Dance? Here?
That man over there. He was in the hotel lobby.
Why?
I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--
I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.
If you're doing all this just for me.
Funny, I never thought of you that way.  You were so close too.  We were all pretty stupid about you.
I told you my father died in jail. He stole a fortune.  Most of it pretty dirty money.  I don't care to have that known.
So could you.  But our records were a little against us.
Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father.  I thought it was a legitimate business.  He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies.  I never saw the pies.  They had names. For the record.  Innocent names.  You know where that kind of money comes from, don't you?
Don't go soft on me, baby.  I've got your note in my pocket.  You wrote it, all by your own self. And I have to use it.  It has to be found in exactly the right place.
And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
This is it, Betty.  They'll find us again, fog or no fog.
Do you think I was faking?
You've had dealings with the police before?
Is it a crime?
You understand perfectly.
This isn't a very good place to talk.
I can't answer that.
No, Jeff.  You don't.  He's not a murderer, I tell you.  He;s not a murderer.
Good morning, Mr. Brandon.
All right. Get him.
What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign.
Got the information on you?
There's two hundred. I'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night
Me a cop? What made you think that, Mr. Brandon?
That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.
Would it have helped if I'd knocked him down?
Hardly. Who's the girl?
Thank you.
In case you want to have us followed.
That COULD BE TOLD.
Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale, Killaine.
You do a lot of real estate trading, Brandon?
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
You asked me where it all came from.
What's the matter, baby. Don't you like me anymore?
Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell.
A little something on account perhaps?
Don't be a fool. I loved him. He wasn't worth it, but I loved him.
One of these days, you're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you've cut your throat.
Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.
You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.
I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years.  This man hadn't been dead an hour.  He wasn't killed last night.  He was killed today. In broad daylight.  That's no drunk- rolling job.
Would you?
Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if it's important.
What do I get for it?
So it seems Sergeant.
I knew him. He was easy to dislike, poor chap.
... I supposed you knew her, too, Inspector.
I've met her.
So the shell ought to have gone over?
I've handled it.  Mitchell's handed it.  If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide.  If I leave it here....no suicide.
Did we ever really think it was suicide?
Oh nothing.
Mayfield?  She fit into this?
She's a suspect, naturally.  But not the only one.
I hear she's a very pretty girl.
I don't know, sir.
I disagree, sir.  As Inspector in charge of the case I have the right to form that opinion, the right to act on it.
Ye have, have ye?
We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles.  Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.
I think you'd be entirely justified, sir.
But you still think she's innocent.
I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
What's this?
It's fine, thank you.
If you like.  But don't be too modest, James.  The citizen's duty is to remember, not necessarily to write books.  You are highly qualified.  You're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job.  Every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history.  A genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you.
She'll be here next weekend.  Why don't you come too, James?  I'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.
Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.
Hello.  Anyone for a walk?  Tom isn't, I can tell you.
Then I began to listen to what the well-off were saying about the poor now — the war had just ended, and the language was much the same as it had been before the first Reform Act.  A small minority thought that England was really theirs, they had made it, they owned it.  The rest, the wage earners, were foreigners, outsiders intent on wrecking it all.
Congratulations.  Who with?
No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
Good.
Yes, please.
I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
Everyone describes the same process. At first it is exciting.  You're at the centre of the world.  As soon as anything happens, you're the first to know about it.  And there are deadlines a dozen times a day, even more, and that's intimidating and exciting.  Then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off.  Your a clerk in a rather dowdy Office.  There's none of the glamour of television, or the penetration of serious journalism.  You're a processor of semi-official news.  Some people leave at this stage.  Then, if you hang on, and especially if you're promoted, you discover a new kind of pleasure.  You're pleased by the ease with which you can write summaries and bulletins from news agency printouts, by the way you ca judge length.  Ending a broadcast on the dot, having everything run smoothly, selecting a running order that makes sense, knowing instinctively what you can and cannot do.  Professionalism.
Who?
Look, will you come on a walk with me tomorrow?
And the Argies.
Now, top secret file.
Uh-huh.  Tell me what you think of this first.
Let me see.
Get way.  You'll see when I'm ready. First I want you to reflect on my noble behaviour, on how your interests are closest to my heart, how I lay awake at night worrying--
Delivering gossip and goodwill. It seems we'll both be doing Brighton.  Perhaps you should come too.
Still in love?
Susan and I are very old friends, James.
Fuck off.
You're a piece of shit
Hello.
Okay, I will.
She's not my mother, anyway.  My mother's in Italy.
It's that lady from Norfolk again.
Well, she doesn't complain much. You know what she's like.  She keeps asking when you're coming...
I've got to be going.  I've got a meeting tonight.
The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
Oh no!
Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
Two years of surgery.  I missed my window.  Limped through law school instead.
Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.
What's this?
Talk.
Wild ride, huh?
Sir?
1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before.
That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
Surf conditions okay?
Smart.  You burn time in the vault.
No, but there are four guys back there you might check out.
When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  Hey, where the hell were you all day?  You gotta at least call in or something.  You okay?
Yeah, or cashing a check.
Nothing?
Angelo!  Don't fire!
Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?
Who's the girl?
I can barely do this in broad daylight.
I... I gotta go.
So what'd the other guy look like?
Hey!  Uh, how do I get back in?
What do you mean?
You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?
No way, old buddy.
Like the old days, Dillon.
Mean anything to you?
It was all bullshit. All of it. From the start... you set us up, got us in here to do your dirty work.
We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us.
I can accept that, it comes with the job.
No way, Dutch. I'm going. You get these people and get the hell out of here.
What's that, General?
He knows our defenses.
Georgia.
No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town?
Of course, yes.  After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
New York.
<u>Ho</u>tel.
What do you want it to be?  Vivian, my name's Vivian.
Must be dangerous.  Hooking.
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
You're joking.
You mean they don't have hookers.
Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're...
Off the boulevard.
Well, the meter's running, it's your money.  Speaking of which, cash'll do.  In advance.
Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
By breaking up a company's assets --
C'mon, I might buy a company some day.
Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?
What?
Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500.
But you want days too.
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
I think it's exciting.
I'm sure that's true for some of them.
Clean the slut up, take her out, huh?!  What are you trying to prove!?  I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!
I don't know what you're talking about.
Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
What if someone tries to steal it?
You mean, besides Elvis?  I'm a human being.  Sure.  Once. First time I ever ran away from home, I got as far as Atlanta. I met this boy.  He'd been with his parents on their way to Chicago.  They stopped at a gas station.  He went to the john. When he came back they'd split. We sorta started looking out for each other.  Aw, he was sweet. And boy, was he good looking, y'know, dark hair and eyes. The chicken hawks were on him all the time.  He hated that. Sometimes we'd find a safe place to crash nights and we'd curl up together and we'd talk about all these crazy things.  The two of us getting married someday. Having kids.  Stupid stuff.
Aw, don't... no...
What's up, where you going?
Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise.
Come on, you can tell me.  I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this.
Vivian's in sales.
Give me twenty minutes.
I don't think there's any sense in --
I was asleep.  You woke me.  You okay?
Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything!  Kit?  Hey, you there?
I'm sorry, Viv'.  Carlos has been on my back.  Did you get the money up front like I taught ya'?
Yeah... I know what you mean.
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
It was great.
Go for the bucks.
What kind of school?
<u>Housekeeping</u>.  I come to turn down the bed.
I think you'll find it normal enough.
Will I like it?
I like steak.
Miss Vivian --
Barnard Thomas here.  Miss Vivian, I wonder if you might come down to the front desk.  There's someone here to see you.
I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
Then why bother curing me?
May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
Rest, Highness.
Of course you will.
Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, "All right, Westley, I've never had a valet. You can try it for tonight. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." Three years he said that. "Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and I eventually became friends. And then it happened.
At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
What?
Why is that, do you think?
You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?
I don't think more than ten.
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
The Man in Black?
-- Fezzik, please --
What's the difference?  We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
Has it been fifteen minutes?
I brought you a special present.
It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake.
Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that.  Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
What?
Because I can stop now if you want.
I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --
She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp.  It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.
Yes.
And our assets?
He's already dead.
I do not suppose you could speed things up?
Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
You're that smart?
Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
Then make your choice.
Wait a minute.  This is a very big decision.  It might effect the course of my entire life.  I'll have to think about it.  I'll do it.
"He wants to croon, he wants to croon,
"To my honey I'll croon,
Do the books!  Do the books!
Here, don't panic.
They come here.  They all come here. How do they find me?
According to the backer's list you raised $60,000.  But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand.  There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.
It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.
Now let's see, two thousand dollars. That isn't much.  I'm sure I can hide it somewhere.  After all, the department of internal revenue isn't interested in a show that flopped.
Yes, what?
What do you mean?
See?  You could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.
What???
Will you get a hold on yourself.
I already have.  Come on.
Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
Right.
Everybody's a big shot.  Well, Leo, are you having a good time?
I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all.
But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
Well, I... Well, it's just that... I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat.
Yes.  We would!
You think out of all those Hitlers you could find just one...
Vhere?  Vhere?... oh...
Ulla, I'd like you to meet my partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.
Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum. Got dag pa dig.  Bialystock and Blum.
Call chauffeur.  Get car.
Finder's keepers.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
I solemnly swear...
Of Siegfried...
Of Siegfried...
Wagner...
Nietzche...
Hindenburg...
The Blue Max...
Six months, I'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby.
What do you do best?
Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
No.
No! Of all...
Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
Now, look...!
Somebody better tell me what's going on and tell me fast! I can take so much and then...
With a little checking, I could get to believe you.
Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...
Were there any calls?
I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do.
With the forty thousand dollars?
I think something's wrong, too, Miss. But not the same thing. I think your private detective is what's wrong.  I think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going... probably from Norman Bates...  and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money.
Please!
May I talk to you?
Here?
I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
Maybe we can handle it together. 
Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound. Ever notice, Lila?
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home...  A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.
Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...
In a hurry.
Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?
How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
Hospital clean.
I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.
Mary, whenever it's possible, tax- deductible or not, I want to see deductible you. And under any conditions.  Even respectability.
I haven't even been married once yet!
I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food.
Stuffy in here.  Well... the mattress is soft and there're hangers in the closet and... stationary with "Bates' Motel" printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious... and... the... over there.... 
Thank you, Mr. Bates.
I'd like to.
Mother...  ...what is the phrase... "she isn't herself today"... I think that's it.
It's a strange hobby. Curious, I mean.
A man should have a hobby.
Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.
Yes, and just one time can be enough.  Thank you.
You slept here all night?
Of course not! Am I acting as if... something's wrong?
Norman? Sheriff Chambers.  Been just fine, thanks. Listen, we got some worries here. Did you have a man stop out there tonight...  Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, anyway. A private detective, name of...
Arbogast.
Mother, please...
Yes.
Just before she died she came to--
He's inherited a fortune.
What made you steal? Are you hungry?
No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.
Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
Sure--they're sorta queer, I'd say. They's lots of queer goings on up there. They even brought a dog back to life once.
That sounds to me very remarkable.
Well, news of Buckley?
Take me down there.
It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--.
By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.
Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.
Another fragment of the diary is shown [having to do with vampires].
No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.
There's no hurry. It's early.
I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
I'm hungry. I'll eat the first child I see. And I've an appointment with young Winton at 8:30.
Why, certainly, sir. My fiancée. Charlotte, may I present Mr. Igor.
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
You wouldn't have said that before you met her.
I'd call it stupid at any time.
Thank you.
Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?
But I think these things are beautiful.
Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird?
If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.
I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
Great! ... If he's worthless we'll give him away as a bridge prize. Come on -- beat it. It's five o'clock. You need some sleep.
Now don't that call for an extra!
What!
That's what I said.
How's every little thing?
Do you know George Winton?
Listen, Flo, cut it out. Hard-Tack is pretty sore.
Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
Yeah. I suppose you people will crucify me for something I didn't do.  I didn't! You understand that! ... I didn't do it! She -- tried before -- 
Cry-baby?
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
It will always afford me great pleasure to see you. 
Your money may have been well invested, my friend. Something important may come of all this.
But I have some friends waiting.
Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.
They didn't have a leg to stand on. There's no case against me. It's a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about.
Then you get it.  You'll understand.
Where is she?
But who were they?
Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.
Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
What'd you do, Rose?
Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft.
Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.
Don't mention it.
Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you.
Of course you can't! I'm... I'm shocked at you, Buddy, real shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm going back to my own bed!
Buddy, you're just a child.
You better quit that.
I hate to turn on this light, you Daddy's awake downstairs, but I have to take the chance.  Buddy, please don't tell on me.
Yeah.
Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
Yep, we had 'em in orange crates all over. It was Daddy's dream. He was goin' to get rich raisin' rabbits. It was what killed Daddy. He didn't drown hisself till a long time later after Momma and Lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him.
Maybe it was eating all those rabbits that made you sexy, Rose.
Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.
Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!
Heh, what a hypocrite.
Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom.
I can't see. What are they doing, what's happening?
He's trying to get up -- good God, one of her titties is out!
She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.
Mother is struggling desperately. In fact she's fighting like a tiger. But I don't know, it's close, it's mighty close.
Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.
Got another twenty years in it, boy.  By the way, son, do you recall Rose, that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion.
The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.
That's what she would say herself.
I know. You loved her. So did I. It was an awful shock to me, too. An awful shock. Rose was so alive it's hard to believe.
The point is you don't grow up like that on a diet of sorghum and hominy grits. She got protein somewhere, she's a very strong girl and I think she'll live... despite the delay in medical treatment.
Well, it's a disaster. I don't know what to say, Doctor, I am floored. How dangerous is the operation?
I am ahead of you.
I have of course observed the girl in treating her.
Turn up your hearing aid.
Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.
Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.
Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place.
You're not having lunch?
Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never eat, darlin', you know that. Not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses. Let's go, Rose, you and Brother, let's hit the road.
I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it.
That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why.
Quarter of twelve.
Oh, shut up, Rose. Shut your mouth and quit crying!
I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.
I'm sorry, darlin', I hate it as much as you do.
Excuse me, sir, are you calling my wife a liar?
I don't care where the polecat studied.
Her plan is obvious, plain as day. She's going on a hunger strike. The question is, how do we foil her?
I don't know how you can call it ideal -- don't you know what the word "farm" means to her?
You're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning. The problem is, what are we going to do?
What did you forget?
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
Is anything wrong?
Nothin'. I got myself up, that's all.
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.
Well, it was a silly question.
Well. What kinda job is it?
Mine.
Took your time gettin' here.
Dave, you are as full of shit as a Christmas turkey and you know it. Now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail, go right ahead. But I am telling you, you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs.
You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear.
It's simply that I find it incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from the girl's illness at the moment, she is very strong, a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one, too. She must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child, if only sporadically.
Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
What are you studying now, Mrs. Hillyer?
Well, I think it's charming, Rose.  But don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight?
Yes, Ma'am.
No more dentists, no more dentists...
Well, I... I... I don't know... maybe it was... but no, you can't be sure about a thing like that. It wasn't Billy, I didn't know him.
I was going to tell him.
Indivisible and inseparable.
I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.
Take her down to the car, and for Christ's sake be careful this time.  Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs.  What a mess.  Why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
Hey now... what the fuck... ?
Lay off once, would you?
What'd I say?
We should slow down.
Where you gonna be?
Dean Martin.
Where we going?
You know, the more weight back there, the faster the car goes.
Smooth move, hot-shot.
Let's go!  Fuck everything!  God damn sons of bitching mother humpers... I'm gonna rip'em all brand new assholes... !
What about Jack Daniels?  Wasn't he a decorated general in the Civil War?
You could start over again with cash like that.
It's noon straight up.  Effective immediately, you three work desk jobs till midnight.
Pardon me... my mistake.  Taking your thoughts in hand, huh... ?
Pure horse.
Slow down.
I'm gonna get beside him.
You put your bumper just behind his left tire and then accelerate... make him spin out...
Alright... how about you two hit the strip and start knocking some heads together?  Find out who "A.D." is.  I got a quick errand to run.
A.D. is a C.P.A.
This much powder you don't throw in the trunk with a blanket over it. It's got to be smuggled.
Yeah?  So, what do you want to ask today that I can't answer?  I'm a busy man.
The way Zimmermann takes such good care of you and this drug-peddling "escort service" of yours, I figure you got the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight.
The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor.
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
Jabba's palace.
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
I have felt him, my Master.
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
Luke.
You got her warmed?
Vader's on that ship.
Hey, are you awake?
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.
He wasn't. I can feel it.
In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
What are you telling them?
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
What do you remember?
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
I will not fight you.
Do you have any tattoos Brad.
Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet.
You promise you won't tell?
He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.
It's as if we were glued to the spot.
Yes Brad.
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
Well I want to leave.
Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
Right!
Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?
Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.
What a guy
"Transylvania"
Now I
Are you - giving a party?
The Master is not yet married.  Nor do I think he ever will be.  We are simply his servants.
Creature of the night.
...How's the turtle food this week?
...I don't know.
Yes.
...T-thank you.
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
'Bout seven.
Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
Paulie!
Don't talk like that to him!
You busted?!
Too old, dull fighter.  Bobby Judge is a good boy.
Yo' bleedin' inside, man -- Get that doctor.
One more round.
I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week.
Hear she's retarded.
Six!
Yo' yellow, old man.
What's ya name again?
What about for food an' stuff?
How'd you know?
You think I don't hear things?
Hey -- if a good man can make a better life, let him make it.
Mr. Balboa --
I know ya need sparrin' partners -- I'm very available.
What?
'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
How old?
Rice is a bum.
'Bout an hour ago.
I got pain an' experience too.
Gimme the water! Ya gettin' tagged with his right. I think you should feint left and high hook 'im -- Benny, check the eyes! Can ya see?
Bullmastiff.
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in an' out of a freezer carryin' meat plays hell on the joints.
Gazzo's gotta come to you.
Sure I like her.
Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.
Yo, Rock. I made a few phone calls an' thanks to me ya goin' to be a big man -- Thatta dog?
What can I do about it?
This is your largest payday ever -- How do you feel about it?
Oh, a ladies man, huh?
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
Do you think the rabbit did it?
I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
Maroon, right?
They?
Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous tonight.  The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist. I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector.
Toon cops worked me over.
Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.
Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
Now what?
I don't work in Toontown.
No, I don't.
My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.
What the hell are you doin'?
You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your logic is specious.  What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?
Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
I'll get it.
No, kid, you're a real hero.
Why that pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline. Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
A challenge, on my life.
But alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
Either withdraw unto some private place, or reason coldly of your grievences, or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here's much to do with hate, but more with love. Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O any thing, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness! Serious vanity! Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! Feather of lead-- [Benvolio Snickers] Dost thou not laugh?
No, cuz, I rather weep.
A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
Young Romeo is it?
He shall be endured
The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
Are you at leisure Holy Father, now? Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
Good marrow, father!
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
For doting; not for loving, pupil mine.
Banishment? Be merciful, say death; for exile hath more terror in his look much more than death. Do not say Banishment.
I come for my lady Juliet.
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
Speakest thou from thy heart?
Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight! For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
Ay me!
Well what shall I swear by?
Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings, And soar with them above a common bound.
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
Well, what was yours?
Signior Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
I thought all for the best.
So where do you go from here?
You call me with the target's route, I follow along until we've reached the attack point and then I run his squag ass off the road.
It's been known to happen.
From Interpol?
You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...
Hazard pay...
I better be getting that.
Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us.
Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we?  What's your job?
Do you have it?
Not so fast.  Who's that?
What do you mean?
There's been a slight problem.
Whatever you wish...  This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you.
We'll die if we stay here!
Don't talk to me unless you tell me what I want to hear, understand?!?  You have no choice in this, don't think about winning, think about staying alive.  I want the item, and if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna kill you.
I sent it to myself in Paris.
Don't cross me...
I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.  He's a cop?
Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?
How did you know?
American.
Soon.
The point remains: we could be working for different people.  There's a chance for one of us...  Maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others.  I don't know about you guys, but I like to know who I'm working for.  It can help prevent a great deal of...  ...unpleasantness.
Long enough to shoot back.
Is that right?
It's been known to happen.
I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds.
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
Help yourself.  Since when do you smoke?
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
It has it's moments.  Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
So, Vincent: why bring me along for the ride?  Job like this calls for a warm body, somebody who can stand around and look threatening.  A tough guy.
I just wanted to see something.
I borrowed that, too...
We live in a singular world, my friend.
Not necessarily.  He could go off road at any number of places.  He might not even be in the country anymore.
You know one around here?  Somebody you trust?
And what job is that?
It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
This doesn't involve you, don't you understand?  I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.
You don't have to do this.
What's this?
I'm a field agent -- last of an already extinct breed.  I do dark ops.
Very ugly.
I don't know...
You speak French.
You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.
Gaelic.
You sure?
You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
I'm alright.  And you?
What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk.  I wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like I said, the Irish and the Russians are an unlikely mix.
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
Tony and I have to talk some business, first.
What the hell happened here?
Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...
Robbed a bank, c'mon!  Don't you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit I don't know how many were at large!  Don't you think there would be a bulletin?  This is a big ass drug deal!
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
It's no accident we stumbled on this money.  It's an answer to a prayer!  Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push.  Tonight my prayer came true.
We'll leave a few packets in the trunk, and stash the rest somewhere else.  Car went up in the gunfight.
We're going to be patient. If we start flashing money around, buying fancy cars and fancy clothes, people are going to ask questions.
I don't know...
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note	or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's just a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.
How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?
What are you talking about?
Well I don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.
Normally we would have tracked him with a wiretap, but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when working with these guys. The last we heard from him was two days ago.
Nothing's wrong.
What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh I...nothing...
And I'd take it out on him.
And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.
I know.
I don't believe it.
A week ago, at most.
How about you give us what you have and leave.
I don't know.
Well we'd like to help you in any way we can.  We're all in this together, as law enforcement officers.
Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
Dwayne.
Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
Hello.
Sixty five...  Jeez Louise!
Just goes to show you.
All right you’re the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
What's this?
I can't hear a word you're saying!
No, Dwayne, you go ahead and relax, have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the TV, and come upstairs and pass out.  And do it all over again tomorrow!
What?
I'm not asking.
What do you mean?  You gambled it?
I was on a roll!  I’m a little overextended now.
Oh Jesus Christ...
Hi ma.
Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID, and if you do you're a damn fool.
Well I don't know --
Thank you honey.  are you sure you don't want it?
Yeah, we did.  It was unleaded, high octane.
No, Carter.  The reason I'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to Hong Kong.  And what the hell is Heaven on Earth?
What the hell is that?
Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James.
I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
I don't think so.
This is your ship?
It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.
Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
Oh, you American?
That's right.
Stevie, how's it going my man?  Somebody get a picture, we can use it for a mug shot.
That's what I'm talking about.  A real Hong Kong night club.  You want an Altoid?
No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
I'm sorry.
Well, hurry up.
That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.
You.
Not Yu.  You!
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
He found out his partner, Tan, had been working for the Triads all along.  Before my father could prove it, he was killed in the line of duty.
It sounds impossible --
Follow the Rich White Man?
You sound like that all the time.
Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?
No.  It was my singing.
She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
There's people up here!
I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.
Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
How was the sex?
Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
No Chinese man discovered electricity.
You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.
Dancing?
I'll go to the craps table, make a big scene.  When security comes over, you make your move.
We made it, man.
That your gate down there?
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
I could use a little vacation.
Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
Why don't you go get them?
The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.
Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.
We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.
Lee, I've missed you, brother.  I heard about the two Americans, I'm so sorry, you must be under great pressure.
Despite what people suspect...what you suspect --
The police can protect you.
Two Americans have been killed on United States Government property -- this is our investigation.
Lee!  It's him!
The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.
Ooo, there's a chill.  Love that.
This is pathetic.
You talk very fast.
You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!
You speak English!
Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.
What plate?
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.
Now, that's American music.
Are you OK?
Excuse me?
What?!
I am from outa town.
Last night's as much my fault as yours.  If he's gonna put the blame on anybody --
How'd what go?
Any demands yet?
I'm talking about the girl.
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Hmmmm?
You a cop or something?
I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.
What are you talking about?
Hello.
Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.
Han?
Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
When were you going to tell me you were not going with us?
So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right?  All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.
Yes.
Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question.  The rest weren't so bad.
What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
Only respectful things.  What did we have in common back then... What kind of music did you like... Did you ruin my life when you left me standing at the altar...
God... Of course.  I'm sorry -- I mean, I'm...  Brian -- I've got to go.  The man's a lunatic, but I know exactly where he's going next.
Of course.
It's hurting.
I'll get the dress.
Bob's in a hurry.
Rub your ears.
I already made an appointment for later today.
See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
Maggie!
Or a vegetarian?
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
If she runs, then it's a cover story. All true.  All accurate.
Of course we are.  Of course.
Good fact.  Well, you let me know.
It's okay.  There's no microphone. You're no fun.
This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --
Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.
Look, look, man.  I think the man is heartbroken.
You're welcome.  Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction.  Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.
Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.
Too much.
Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
No.
Kind of isolated.
I think so... When I was walking down the aisle?  I was  walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was.  And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted.  So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me.
So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?
For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?
There he is.  Snoop Doggy-Dogg.
Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.
I'm going to kill myself.
... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not coming.
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
No.
Houseboats don't go anywhere.
We will?  The Symphony?  Okay.  I'll take you to the Russian Tea Room for pelmeni.
I do.
Beautiful view, isn't it?
And now 2,000 women want his number.  The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick.
You're a basket case.
And this woman is a writer! That's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers.
Right.
I don't know.  I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
This is a photo of hair.
No, I know that part --
I'm Jonah.  That's my dad.  His name is Sam.
What?
Annie, when you meet someone and you're attracted to them, it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious, subconsciously.  So what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match.
Yes, I did.
Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom.
I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.
Hello.
It's you.
Why not?
Do you think there's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife? Maybe even more?
It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff.  It's like it makes him sadder.
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.
How about rapacious and love- starved?
Hey, my plate is full.
I don't get it.
Window.
Dad?  About last night?
Not.
How many people do you think heard that thing last night?
P.  Dad?
Whose show was this on?
Hi, Dad.  Dad, this is Jessica.
Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
I know.
I never did.  Or the whole idea of an afterlife.  But I don't know any more.  I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.  So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?
This is a good letter, Dad.
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
Jonah!
Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
Did too.
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
How's Jonah taking it?
What do you mean?
I thought you were never going to call me.
It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.
Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff!  I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled -- which I doubt -- I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us.  It should've been a union demand from the beginning.
Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to.
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
Mother of God ...have mercy ...
He was born fighting. And born hungry.
They say I am no good to you.
No.
Can be what?
And you know why? Because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two, three months. What's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?
Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. "Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican" -- that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, "Stay in your place." Do you feel better having someone lower than you?
Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.
Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?
Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, "Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans."
Go on. Spill it.
Forgot what?
Where's your mama?
But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...
He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?
No, I don't mind.  That's how come I told you about it.
Did you see his hair color?
I guess I don't have a hell of a lot of choice.
I ain't a idiot, asshole.
Oh God.
Could be worse.  Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.
Nothing.
Then leave.
I can't.
You get off on abuse or something?
Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
How much time do you have?
What is wrong with you?
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
What's wrong, Danny?
Will you do that?  Then I want you to get out of the room.
Oh shit
Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?
Is that what you want me to do?  Put it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out in the afterlife?
You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.
I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred.  Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like?
I'm hurting.
That's a good one.
I'm serious, dude.  You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'.
You mean, like to throw 'em off?
What does J.F.K. stand for?
Was he the president?
Nah... I want to keep it.  Maybe I can use it for like, inspiration ...you know...like when I detox?
Wouldn't be a favor if you were paying me. I'll just take my five when the deal is done.
Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously.
Please .. I don't know what you're ...
Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel?
I've got a hot one.
Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.
It's not my place.
I met the guy at a party.  He said he wanted to do a biggie. He's new in town so I offered my services.
Who the hell is Jimmy?
That would be me.
Excuse me?
Speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me?
A virtuoso rendition.  TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece.
Tom, let's spend the night here.
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
You mean like the Donner Party?
We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There.  You happy?
I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?
Find a chaplain.
Good luck, John.
You must be a hell a shot.
Last I knew.
He's right, we can't shoot him...well, we could but we'd get in an enormous amount of trouble.  And he's right about the bridge, it's a hell of a lot more important than he is.
He ain't half-bad, I guess.
Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent.
You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?
It's worth it.
No white-walls, sir, there's a war on.  NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE!  I can't help you, sir.
I wasn't made for this.
What about our grenades?
Sure, you got one?
But, sir...
Hell of a mission.
You think they'll be alright?
Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.
Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?
Except this time, the mission IS a man.
Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?
No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Why's that?
You set?  Sarge nods.
Shit, sir.
Speak with my lawyer.
Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?
I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.
Hey, sis.
It's no problem.  I called Mom and Dad in Germany; it's like they were there.
But you never had a first date.
Then what's love?
Wait for me for when I get round to the front. 
Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.
I am.
And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
Hey, I know this is a strange thing to say, but maybe Diane Court really likes Lloyd.
I'll put this past my boss
Lloyd, she's being difficult.
You won it.  You're going to study at the finest institute at England, the toughest fellowship in the country, and you won.
Which they did.  Let me finish.
Do you wanna make things easier on me?  Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit.  You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.
Did he ever get rough with you?
What happened to you?
Honey!
You stole from them, you lied to me.  How do you think that's supposed to make me feel?
I made their lives better.
I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
Mom, please?
Well, not monumentally.
Well...
I'll go.
Whoa.
They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.
Keymaster?
So we can finally talk?
Have a good sleep.
That's cool then.
Basic.  Hmmm.
I only have something like sixteen weeks.
I think you should wear that.
Yes.
No.
Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social.
Yeah, just keep going first, keep going around.  Get the feel of it, feel the clutch, when you put it in a little?
Yeah.
I don't think so.
I don't know.  I'm happy.
Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
'Cause I'm worried, did you just break up with me?
No, no.
It sounded like you did.
You shared it with a dick.
You have Corey and DC.  I have my dad.
Then don't do it.
Hey man, I was in love once.  I got hurt really bad.  I never wanna go through that again.
Yeah Lloyd.  What are your plans for the future?
I'm totally and completely serious.
That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.
Well Lloyd, I admire you for not hitching a ride.  You know, my daughter's a lot different to you.
I know.  But then I reconsidered.  'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter.  I'm good at it.
Joe.  Joe.  She's written sixty-five songs.  They're all about you.  They're all about pain.
I don't know.
I don't know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.
You must chill!  You must chill!  I have hidden your keys. CHILL!
Oskar - my friend Lena.
Oskar, please -
I don't have to like her just because you do.  It doesn't work that way.
You held back Stern.  You held back the one man most important to my business.
They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
Pistols?
What others?
Get the contracts and I'm sure you'll do very well.  In fact the worse things get the better you'll do.  It was a "pleasure."
I'll admit it's a weakness.  I don't think he enjoys it.  All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?
I think it's too late.
Eight hundred, give or take.
We need to talk.
If I'd made more money ...I threw away so much money, you have no idea. If I'd just ...
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?
Can't we hold him?
Have you checked the...
He's broken his pattern.
That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there.
I heard a noise.
Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...
Hang up...call...
Oh, I'm sorry. My bad.  I thought you were someone else.
Where is everybody?
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
Fair enough.
Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.
And much richer as a result.
What are you going to do?
No. This is a set up.
Why?
You weren't supposed to leave her alone.
He sent me the cutest e-mail.
We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
Oh yeah.  We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. It’s been an ongoing discussion.  Heads or tails?
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
I never meant to imply...
I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say except I'm sorry.
The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Oh my God. How could it happen?
As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy.
Yeah, right.
I'm sorry.
It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
Someone’s trying to kill me. I need the police.
You're going to get it. You know what happens.
Time to change numbers again?
I'm the only one who can cut him down.
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
..this week's TKE kegger...
..harmonica style is okay.
Gale?
Take it off.
Do you work for her now?
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.
Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.
Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
Well what number are you trying to reach?
Please, call me Gale.
The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother.
What do you mean?
He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3 Production offices. That's where Sarah Darling was murdered last night.
This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
But you know who she was.
Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.
Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!
I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.
Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
Get real, that would make me a suspect!
Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.
Gale he's got Dewey!
Who's this?
Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?
Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number.
It is in my script.
What?  What movie?
No.
W-what do you want?
Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think. It's all been building up to this Sid. Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of blood that's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT.
If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!
Hello?
I'm sorry, your voice.
Dude. What are you doing here?
I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.
FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
Now that it's out of your system.
Jesus, SHIT!
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
It's been a year since she died.
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.
So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
You heard me.
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
You don't still think it was me?
Stop it!
So why did you dial it again?
What?
Why don't you want to talk to me?
Just some scary movie.
Do you like scary movies?
Gotta go.
To talk.
Where are you?
I wanna play a game.
Then he dies. Right now.
Come on. It'll be fun.
No... please.
I'll even give you a warm up question.
Come on, yes you do.
It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.
He's not a suspect, is he?
Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.
You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit?
Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.
How is she?
She's tough.
That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records.
She's okay. Looks like some boys were teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the school though. I want you to take look around.
Casey? Where are you honey? Call the police, goddamnit.
Off the record. No cameras.
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
LEAVEMEALONE!
...out at the airport...
Stu was with me last night.
Working, thank you.
Don't shoot. It's me.
That was an ice pick -- not exactly the same.
It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.
Which is you...
He came to make up.
Wanna another beer?
You're crazy -- both of you.
So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them?
No way.
Do they know who did it?
Thanks, Tatum.
It's past seven.
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
He was there, Tatum.
This could be good. What do you think, Sid?
Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
He cuts off the skin if his fingertips. That's why we can't find a single usable print in the apartment.  He's been doing it for quite a while.  Keeps cutting before the papillary line can grow back.
What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.
"Dear Detectives, Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light." It's the murderer's way of announcing himself.
What's this: "I'm declining this case?"  It don't work that way.
Have you heard?
Yeah.
It's always been like this.
They're hoping you stop and say goodbye before you go, but I told them not to expect it.
He's being arraigned tomorrow.
What's so exciting?
Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder.  You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.
I can't wait for you to see.  I can't wait...  It's really going to be something.
I... I doubt I enjoyed it any more than... Detective Mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without windows.  Isn't that true?  How happy would it make you to hurt me, with impunity?
Murderers like you?
A woman... so ugly on the inside that she couldn't bare to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside.  A drug dealer... a drug dealing pederast, actually.  And, don't forget the disease spreading whore.  Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face.  That's the point.  You see a deadly sin on almost every street corner, and in every home, literally.  And we tolerate it. Because it's common, it seems trivial, and we tolerate, all day long, morning, noon and night.  Not anymore.  I'm setting the example, and it's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed, from now on.
Since we're just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar... sit and talk for awhile.  After that, we'll...
I... I don't follow.
I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell.  I've worked homicide for five and a half years.
It's a bucket of vomit.
You go to movies at least?
You're sure your men didn't move this?
Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?!
And you don't?
Oh, that's all.
We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom.  It's like collecting diamonds on a desert island.  You keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.
Does this make it with you?
Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic.  The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  To connect tubes to his genitals.  To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.  He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.
That's what it says.  Jonathan Doe.
Think about it...
If we get him, I'll be happy enough.
People don't want a champion.  They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.
It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.
Slut.
Stay with him.
Throw your weapon, detective!  Now!
It surprises me.  It really does.
Neighbors heard them screaming at each other for like two hours.  It was nothing new.  But, then they heard the gun go off. Both barrels.
How should I know?
Why'd they break off?  Was there water in that canyon?
What you saw wasn't Lucy.
You're goin' if the captain says you're goin'...
You ain't goin'...
Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.
But...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection...
Swear it, Ethan?...Given word?
How'd you come by this?
That's what I said.
Well, come on!
Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...
Hey! What's the idea...?
Nine...  Ten!
How? She's even forgot her own language!
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
You crazy?
What kind of a horrible thing is that?
Do you have a better idea?
I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you.
Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other?  Honesty - trust!
Hey, you're still here.  I suppose you like it here with us.
Where have you been?
Who's that?
What?
Let me guess:  Another short circuit?
I told you, there is no way out. He won't let you go.
We are in desperate want of a Mercutio, Ned, a young nobleman of Verona
Ned…I know…I know
You are a gentleman.
Yes, I've seen you in something. That one about a king.
Really?
Do you know that house?
We will all be put in the clink.
What is the chief part?
It's for Henslowe. He paid me.
Ten pounds.
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
Mr. Fennyman, because you love the theatre you must have a part in my play. I am writing an Apothecary, a small but vital role.
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
by order of the Master of the Revels!
Is it going well?
I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. As I explained to you, the theatre business
Well, I am a dead man and buggered to boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful -
Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see a Romeo?
We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster.
It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.
Romeo.
Juliet? You mean Ethel.
Not new--my Doctor Faustus.
I love your early work. "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?"
Yes, that's good. Until he meets
This is a different one.
Playhouses are not for well-born ladies.
Your Majesty.
As stories must when love's denied--with tears and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder.
Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts.  How much was the wager?
"…Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"
"The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night. See how she leans her cheek upon her hand. O that I were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek.
She will breed. If she do not, send her back.
Like you, I found him not at home!
My lady!
You can bring them with a word.
Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
Oh
And that was only my first try.
I must. Look-- how pale the window.
Moonlight!
No, the morning rooster woke me.
I know how to fight!
I am done with theatre. The playhouse is for dreamers. Look where the dream has brought us.
My lady Viola.
My lord.
I have spoken with your father.
You flatter, my lord.
No. I have spoken to the Queen.  Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
I do not love you, my lord.
The Queen has consented?
I am going to church.
Your name?
I . . .
Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
And break her heart and mine?
I … Her letter came to me by the nurse.
Your aunt?
You are on my ground.
All right, just a few questions.
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
He made it clear.
Have you seen him?
Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me that you're not interested. I know you well enough.
Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to do --
After you drink to love and happiness forever.
Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond recognition.
But there's no --
It looks like he's writing everything down.
Take another look at these two.
That's it, then.
What? Uh, no, no, it's a fake. I picked it up in Thailand. The second hand doesn't sweep, you see.
Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?
Yes.
Oh, yes, it's great.
Well, yes.
Well, she had problems --
So we'll meet him, then?
Yeah.
I think you're lying.
David?
His car's still there.
So what's wrong with that?
Alex.
No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
Who's going to do it?
Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?
What's he doing here?
That's not him.
Are you all right?
Be like a weight off your shoulders.
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
Now you thought of that, not me.
Everything.
Of course, but I think you'll find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed --
It's about me and David.
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
Who said there were four?
Loks like you had a break-in up here as well.
Are you all right?
I'm sorry.
Two hundred.
Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
We already know. All about it.
What do we do here, David?
Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done.
That one, last week.
You must be Hugo.
What's it about?
The telephone? It continues to ring.
Air France. Glasgow. Direct, but then you're looking at the wrong end of nine hundred and twelve pounds. That's nine one two. It's up to you.
Yes.
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
Why not?
What?
Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
You're very rude... if you don't come back --
I gotta talk to you.
I can see that.
All I ever do is play. I should be doing something to get my own shop open.
Why don't you see Lester?
Hi.
No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
That headboard.
No, baby. Now look, that girl that called -- I have to talk to her, she'll do something.
Like what?
Are you?
See if you've been making it with my mother.
I'd like to do your hair sometime.
Yeah.
I am not!
Jesus, look at this. Nine, nine and three quarters -- that's our prime rate. And I'll tell you something else: the big boys are going for it.
After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying six percent. Six percent. FHA's at eight and a half -- no, we won't be going back to the old days.
I guess not...
What sort of references do you have?
I've got the customers... that's my point. I'm the one they want. If I had my own shop, they'd leave and come to me. I have a lot of customers.
Yeah.
Yes, Buffums.
You promised you'd do the show.
What!
Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.
Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.
-- Well no. It never came up.
Baby...
No! Don't! Please!
-- you are.
-- last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.
-- good afternoon --
-- It's Malone's.
It's too late...
Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him.
Yeah?...
I'm busy, man.
-- you know better...
I guess you haven't heard from her yet.
What're you talking about?
I've had these dumb dreams lately.
I just... who what?
Nobody's gonna get you. Now get inside.
What?
You're different.
Yeah.
We live together now.
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
Hey, I'm, you know --
Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
George.
Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
When can I talk to you?
About what?
Your advice!
A friend dropped me off.
I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.
I don't want to fight, George.
I didn't want him meeting me here.
You did fuck him, didn't you?
That was him.
Baby, don't do this --
-- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
-- yes.
Please!... that's not like you.
It's good you want to do something, George.
-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
Well anyway...
Yeah.  How long have you been here?
All night.
Well, what?
I'm not anti-Establishment.
Then don't... just have 'em beat me up or whatever you're gonna do.
... yes, I follow your thinking on that.
You really think so?
A daytime soap opera.
Who were you talking to?
It's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world. You wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth...
Poster-Kleiser.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
-- No. No really.
Well, it's George.
Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
We don't think marriage is important.
Honey?
-- uhh-huhh...
-- He reached up and tore them.
-- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?
Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
George? Was he alone?
That bastard.
Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind?
-- so when are you going to Egypt?
Two weeks from tomorrow.
-- listen, I wonder if you kids could give me a ride? I'm kind of stranded here.
Jill.
Where to, Les?
Yes, Dad.
What?
Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you?
Tony.
Who's Tony?
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
Jack...
Oh what a Maze.  Isn't it beautiful.
Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
Now Danny, can you remember what you were doing just before you started brushing your teeth?
Talking to Tony.
Where does he go?
Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
Oh I wouldn't think of it.
Sure.
haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Yes, sir.  I have a wife and eh two daughters, sir.
Sure.
Yeah.  We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.  But how did you know that?
What line of work are you in now?
How's my credit in this joint anyway?
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.
Yes...
Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me.
Stay away from me.
Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.
Let's see, where were we?  Yes.  I was about to explain that eh... our season here runs from oh May 15th to October 30th and then we close down completely until the following May.
Well...
I don't believe they did.
I'd better collect my family first.
Lowe's car-?
Rattling. Rustling.
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?
I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation.
You want to know what I think?
If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.
Perhaps.
Really.
Yeah.  We all got caught.  Shoplifting. Cuttin' school.  Cuttin' up some bitch with a blade.  So we gotta come here.  So we'll be good, in the future.  So we'll learn valuable lessons.  And I learned mine.  I will be incredibly good, I will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again.  Can I go now?
What about crack?  You a user?
You know, I just might!
Yes, Mary?
How come?  Sister?
What?
Vince...
You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?
You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?
I was good to you! You re nothing but no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit Tramp!
Oh, girls.
HE'S SO FINE.
Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?
What?  What time is it?
What?
She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.
Mary Clarence!
Who are all these people?
Those people are wonderful!  Why don't we ever see them in church?
Oh my Lord!
WE'RE THE SISTERS OF THE SACRED HEART WE DO OUR BIT, NOW DO YOUR PART
You were unhappy?
It has come to pass.
Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence.
Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.
No food?
In English?
Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable!
A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor?
I was thinking Las Vegas.  Get some butts in those seats.
And what next?  Popcorn?  Curtain calls? This is not a theater.  or a casino.
Really.  Well, that makes two of us.
Okay, so I just got things started.  But you could build on that.  You could keep it going.
You saved my life.
I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other.
So I don't shop.
'Cause you're always out, arresting people.  Making trouble.  I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard!
And if I don't?
Okay, here's what I want.  I know about this stuff.  A five-star hotel.  With room service.
Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
I am?
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
It didn't work, Vince.
Right.
Get her!
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.
You mean -- they kidnapped her?
Not a note.
But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.
Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely?
We both missed.
Who took the meat?
It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.
They need guidance.
You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.
Do you have these persons' wills?
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
I shall, gladly.
The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants.  And the Widow Windsor was next...
Where are we going?
We should not go much further in this murk.
What good is this?
My father had farm land.  It was the only thing we owned of any value.
No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has gone intestate.
Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town is owed a great many debts?
There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing.
Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.
Thank you.  No.  Here...
What are you on about?
What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
Allow me some time.  I have spent every hour in the company of others. I need to be alone.
No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
I apologize if I worried you.
What are you doing?
When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.
No.  She has gone out.
There was not much blood, was there?
I hear him.  He rides to the Hollow and back.
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
How are you, Bill?
French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.
It's too big.
Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.
I thought I told everybody to get out of my house. That includes cocksuckers and retards. Get off your asses and go.
It went real good.
Stop it, Doyle!
Stop it, Doyle! Don't talk about daddy, you hear me!
Okay, I'll leave and sober up. Everything's botherin' me, that's all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you.
Do you like to play football?
You told me to come by.
Wait a minute. You want to go with me? You can meet my mama.
You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.
It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.
I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.
That gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin' with her.
Hit was right thoughty of her.
If you want me to.
Naw.
She said she'd see me later. That's kinda good, right?
What you readin'?
It don't matter to me about us losin' does it to you?
Yeah, I guess.
I knowed you'd be here.  What are you a-doin' digging with that stob?
I'm tired, too, Frank.  If I ain't around no more, it don't mean I don't care fer ye. I care for ye a good deal. I care for you more than anybody they is. We made friends right off the bat.
You don't want to give away all your books.
Yes sir.
You know I would. Whatever you want.
Oh, that's Karl. I met him at the laundrymat. Karl, this is my mama. And Vaughan, Vaughan's the manager. He lets mama off any time she feels like it 'cause they're best friends.
Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you can stay with us. Out in the garage. Our car won't fit in there anyway. It's real neat.
Karl, now listen, there's gonna be a party tonight here at the house. Doyle's invited his music-playin' buddies over to make a bunch of racket out on the patio.
I ain't got no boy.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to looking at pretty people.
I told 'em about it. They know I'm well. That Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits.
Do you reckon you can make me some biscuits?
Mustard's good on 'em to me.
I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.
Did you knock on the door yet?
Naw, I ain't.
How long have you been standing here?
I mean tomorrow or the next day.
I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow.
I wouldn't never hurt them.
Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt them, has he?
What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay here?
Frank's just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.
I think there must have been a little mix up. I told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures. It's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right?
Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk him into it. I'm a real good interviewer. Just get me in the room with him.
Before they were married?
It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.
Yes.
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
And what's the occasion of this celebration?
Better make it charge. 
I finished my story. I thought you might want to take a look at it.
I'd love to.
Taking pictures?  It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.
A photographer ...
You'll never get it if you don't slow down, my friend.
It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.
Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.
You usually get two.
Fine.  Or it was until a couple of days ago. A guy from The New York Times called and asked me to write a Christmas story. They want to publish it on Christmas Day.
Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was.
Like what?
Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen.  She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant.  I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.
Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now.  Was that your idea to call her Felicity?
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
That's what you told me when I shoplifted that necklace for you. You remember, baby, don't you? The judge gave me a choice: either go to the can or enlist. So, instead of going to college, I wind up in the navy for four years, I watch men lose their arms and legs, I nearly get my head blown off, and you, sweet Ruby McNutt, you run off and marry that asshole, Bill.
Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
Fifteen years ago?  It won't wash, pumpkin. No mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he's a father. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.
I told her she was going to meet her father.
She looks just like you.
Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves.
I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control.  I could run this store in my sleep.
I don't know.  Maybe because I love you so much, boss.
You don't take anything seriously, do you?
A little. Not much.
What is this, some kind of joke?
So I can get my job back.
Fifty-six.  That girl had on a corset.
And these?
Forty-four. They're on special this week from the Canary Islands. A real bargain.
The damn lock's broken again.  And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game?
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
You mean Rashid?
Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.
I was about to get run over by a car, and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life.  I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more, I don't know. I feel pretty stupid about it now.
He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.
No thank you.
I figured he had a right to know.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.
Five bucks! You mean you're going to charge me five bucks just to look at it?
And have you mended them?
And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
Thomas Cole. My name is Thomas Jefferson Cole.
You can do whatever you want with your own life. We're thinking of the baby, that's all. We want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby. Before it's too late.
Yeah, well, there ain't no baby in there now. You dig? There's nothing in there now.
Yeah? And why is that?
Of course there's gonna be a war. You think they'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun? I mean, there's plenty of beach, but not a hell of a lot of water. Half a million soldiers. It ain't no seaside holiday, you can bet on that.
Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.
Are you sure you don't want some food to go along with it? It might help to absorb some of that liquid. You don't want to slosh around too much when you stand up.
Mostly what.
In Manhattan?
Here and there. Around.
This is the first house I've been in without a TV.
I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?
Is your father an artist?
Eight-thirty?
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry... I was trying to reach for one of the books up there ...  And then, I don't know, the sky fell on top of me.
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man. 
Appreciation for what?
I don't, huh? And what makes you such an authority on what I want or don't want?
It looks like they've met in this apartment.
What time did you get to bed last night?
Come on, just a little hint.
So you're saying it wasn't like that at all.
Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.
So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
Well?
We came here to deliver some clean laundry.
Don't know how long it's take to get a charge...
But you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his.
No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?
Just three questions.  The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?
Trials aren't only about truth, Mr. Hooks.  Even though they should be.  They're about what people <u>believe</u> is true.
We all expect the world to be fair. As if we have some right t...
You have to hear this, I can never touch you, Ishmael.  Not once, not ever.  There's no half- way.  As much as I know it hurts you, you have to let this go.
So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager?
And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
Then putting them together.  So truth is revealed.
And I wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful.  At a tactic that insults their intelligence.
Robbed.  He was angry.
Mr. Jurgensen.  Did he offer to <u>buy</u> the seven acres from you?
And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
It's the way it happened, I know it is.
See you replaced a mooring line, lately.  This one's new.
Sheriff, I can't afford not to fish toni...
You must think I like losing.
Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin.  And forgot the cup.
So the defendant went out fishing for the night with <u>no</u> spare battery, hmmn?
I believe so.
He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
What else could it be?
I can't speak for him.
Improved...how?
Bye.
Beat it, Buster.
You know, Bienstock, there's something funny about those two new girls.
I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?
Because I lost a filling in my back tooth. I gotta go to the dentist tomorrow.
Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
Yeah - where were you?
What are you doing?
I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive.  There'll be no buzzing around tonight.
Fight it.
Good night, Daphne.
Well, now you know how the other half lives.
They don't care - just as long as you wear skirts.  It's like waving a red flat in front of a bull.
Blow where?
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
I'm a push-over for whom?  What is it? Who's on the phone?
Just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and Rudy Vallee.
And where's he going to be?
Daphne - your boy friend is waving at you.
Congratulations.  Who's the lucky girl?
You think he's too old for me?
Why not?  He keeps marrying girls all the time!
Look, stop treating me like a child. I'm not stupid.  I know there's a problem.
You're out of your mind!  How can you get away with this?
Like right after the ceremony.
Then we'll get a quick annulment - he'll make a nice settlement on me - I'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -
Look, Jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy!
That's some nerve!
I tell you, Joe, they're on to us.  They're going to line us up against the wall and -  Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh - and then the police are going to find two dead dames, and they're going to take us to the ladies' morgue, and when they undress us - I tell you, Joe, I'm just going to die of shame.
OH!
Terribly sorry.
Good night, Sugar.
It must be freezing outside.  When I think of you - and your poor ukulele -
Interesting.
You got some?
What's the surprise?
Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.
Not you, Sugar.
Oh, please do come.  Don't disappoint us. It'll be such fun.  And bring your yacht.
Oh, come on - you can do better than that.
I was it.
What's wrong with us?
Fascinating.  Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know, sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - Zowie! - but Mama broke it up.
I'll throw up!
They got a Cuban band that's the berries. Why don't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn?
Yes, Osgood?
I called Mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it's white lace.
Just the two of you?  What about the crew?
Oh, it's you!  You got a lot of nerve -
What are you - a couple of comedians? Get out of here!  Long distance?  Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.
It's not the backs that worry me.
Hey, Sheboygan - you two - what was your last job - playing square dances?
We got it second-hand.
So you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job, and the next saxophone player, and it's the same thing all over again.  See what I mean? - not very bright.
Millionaires.  Flocks of them.  They all go south for the winter.  Like birds.
Okay, Sugar - all clear.  You better go back to bed.
Well, there they are - more millionaires than you can shake a stick at.
I wish you'd make sure.
Not very likely.
Your view of what?
Well, I'm not.
You're very kind.  I'll bet you're also very gentle - and helpless -
It's been delightful meeting you both.
And you will come to hear us tonight?
Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.
Thank you.  And thank you for the flowers.
I wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of Long Island is fogged in.
Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer -
It looked so small from the beach - but when you're on it, it's more like a cruiser - or a destroyer.
Just regulation size.  We have three like this.
My dad is more interested in railroads. Baltimore and Ohio.  Which is the port and which is the starboard?
Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
I'll say.  I had two ponies drowned under me.
Where's your shell collection?
Have you ever tried American girls?
Is that anything?
Anything this time?
Gee, I wish I'd been there.
That's funny - I never slept better.  And I had the most wonderful dream.  I was still on the yacht, and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and I was the crew - I kept a lookout for icebergs, and I sorted your shells, and mixed your cocktails, and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when I woke up, I felt like swimming right back to you.
A merger?  How long will you be gone?
You're not?
What's what?  Oh, that.  just a little going away present.
Big joke!
Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.
I should get going.
What’s his problem?
There’s something about him that’s just a bit odd.
Why, Jeffrey. Hello.
You were so good to me. I swear I never meant to hurt you. We were together what, five years?
Not for a dog.
Is this supposed to be an apology?
What color are my shoes?
He was pretty drunk, but I think he’s still crazy about you.
I don’t know.
Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.
Have you ever done anything like this before?
Not you. You’re not disgusting. You’re lovely. Just the idea that they’d bring an escort. I mean, a stranger who, um, didn’t...who never.... I mean, someone’s dead.
Would you grab my shampoo?
Oh, no.
And you thought I’d respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
What?!
Are you asking me if I’m gay for pay?
Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
What would you do if you weren't an escort?
I heard you were back in town, kitty cat. You’re here for the highland flings, I bet.
Give it back? Are you nuts?
Dad!
It’s complicated, Dad.
I always wondered what happened with us.
I just wanta wash my hand. It's got blood where I hurt it.
Is he here in Borderdale?
David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder.  That feels better.
Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead?
But where is my daddy!?
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
Don't tell me about what's wrong. You come into my office as a friend and steal city files! I could have you arrested for that -- and if you give out that information to anybody, that's exactly what I'm going to do -- and I'll tell everybody in this town how you got the information and who you got it for! You won't have a friend left in this county to bring you a piece of candy!
He beat you, too, Daddy, and you had a big ol' shootin' rifle.
Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
"You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"
Hi, Daddy...
We didn't find Sounder yet.
Yes, David...
David Lee, it's time for you to get to bed!
You got two shirts on?
Yes mam...
No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
Good night, Mama...
Who's Miss Johnson?
So when I left, she gave me these books.
We brought your laundry, Miss Boatwright.
I'll walk...
You know, one time by mistake I went into a white church down in Row County and to this day I don't know how'n the devil I got outta that church alive.
Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?
Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?
What did he want?
To invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree, drink ice cold whiskey, and just shoot the breeze!
Is there something I can do to help you?
Where you goin'!?
It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.
Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.
What...
The clitoris?! I DID IT!! I FOUND THE CLITORIS!!
My head hurts.
OW!! That HURT GOD DAMMI-
How would you like to go to the principal's office?
What is this?
Fuck that!  AGAGH!!
Dude, this is seriously lame. I didn't know we were gonna get all dirty and stuff.
No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him!
But they fucking didn't do anything wrong!
YOU DO?!
Cartman?!
Mph rmprmmh rm!!
Mom...
You bastards.
I am Satan. I am your God, now.
What do you mean?! I could leave him if I wanted to!
Hey, relax Satan. Don't get all worked up. You're gonna give yourself an ulcer again.
No... The General is right.
Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.
That's gonna take a long time!
"Found Eight Million Pages With the Word Clitoris"!
SILENCE!!!  NOW!!!  EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO ME!!!
Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt! Not again!
Article 42!  You don't mean-?!
It's from your mother.
Hello, Conan!
Oh, you are such a maroon!
Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good.
You're quite a purveyor of filth, little boy!
Well of COURSE he wants out of hell! The whole POINT of hell is that you don't WANT to be here!
I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my crank!
Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!
You don't care.
That's because I wanted to fuck you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down!
What if I just left?
Hey, I'm missing the party!
Help you? You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?!  You're always making me feel like a piece of shit.
You didn't?
No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.
Cool!
Oh Warren...oh Warren...take me, God take me...
Oh yeah...
Oh, thank you.
Where the hell did you come from?
I was there.  Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors.  They are not functioning properly.
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
I think I can handle it.
If anyone can hear me please respond!
Break it down to me, what's going on?
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
That's right.
So you were looking for a new challenge.
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
A little dab'll do ya. Now you know how to get there, right?
Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.
Well now what are we gonna do!
You're gonna give him those bank codes, you know why?  Because I'm telling you to, that's why.  I'm not losing my life over some greedy pig.
Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?
Mac, I have a favor to ask you. Mac looks at Taylor -
Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
Certainly.  I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.
Now Mac, can you tell me the status of this deck?
But the corridor outside this door is open, correct?
Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
You listen to the feelings, not the words.
Buzz Burger, side of 'cues. You haven't introduced me to your fan.
You look like you're something on the lanes.
Simple math, Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.
I'm not on the tour this year.
They suspended me for 100 years.
Orange whip, nectar of the bowling gods. Thanks sweetie. Millie turns the tray so that Buzz takes the untainted whip.  Theo takes the other glass.
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
It's the next level, the next dimension...  ...the small ball.
Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
What the fuck is this?
I'm getting to like it here.
I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.
Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.
Hello, mom?
NO. I SAY KNOCK-KNOCK! You say who's there. I say who's there and then you say who who. You're not playing right.  Knock-knock.
You shouldn't touch her.
Hey, enough fun and games. We have work to do. Come on Junior. Kastle heads for his car. Junior gets up and follows. The two sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands.
That's some pinfall. Almost a 133 average. Her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control.
There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.
You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes!
Don't go near the bowling alley.
Now swing it out a little to the right...
Won't your father help you with that?
Do you talk with your mom?
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
So why do you stay?
I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?
You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming?
Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.
Why not?
I feel sick.
You should.
Where are you going?
Aagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers!
Who identified the body?
The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality.
Not everything.  Even on earth.  Take ... yeasts.
Back at the door -- I asked you to back away.
Yeah.  I heard you.
I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it.
Nice work, Captain sir.
Thirty yards.
What was that?
Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.
Don't do it!
Thank you, Colonel.
Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you.
Then why am I here?
What?
It's impossible.
It doesn't make any sense.
Don't get hysterical, Norman.
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
Damn it, Edmunds?
Any sign of Harry?
Sir, if the subs haven't left by now...
What?
Ted, get her away from the door.
Look at this.
Some sort of lead or something.
That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
It never occurred to me.
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back.
So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody.
"Although advised of risks, all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft.  Signed, Barnes, USN."
Don't do this.
You bastard.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
You fixed my suit?
You don't trust me?
What's the matter?
Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.
Still clear?
The refridgerator.
1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
But why is he doing it?
It's an idea.
What is it, Norman?
The grooves around the door -- they've shifted.  And the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now.
It's getting cold.
You don't think I put something in it, do you?
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
You know what I mean.
Against what?  Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.
No, he isn't.
You manifested that, Beth.
Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
I never went in that sphere.
C'mon --
You hear that?
Get away from me!
Pry the thing open?  What are we -- neanderthals?
All that banging and pounding.  I don't know.  We should think about making a good first impression.
Why are you looking at me like that?
We can refuse to talk.
Where's it coming from?
Fine.  I'm fine.
Our answer.
To what?
I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?
I don't follow you.
Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?
What is it, Harry?
Page 87 of what, Harry?
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
What happened to her?
You didn't say that about the food?
We're never gonna make it.
Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.
What'd you say to him?
But it's impossible.
If it is an alien spacecraft --
Meaning?
It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.
Does this mean what I think it means?
That whole time -- I couldn't stop thinking of what Harry was saying earlier...
I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am really, just been a while.  I treat aircrash survivors.
Huh?
You mean you don't know?
Strange, isn't it?  You know -- how it would have a button.
Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
Well, he's polite.
I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel.  Who's in charge then?
The Empire must have gotten here first.
The planet has been totally blown away!  It would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than I've ever seen... If the Empire had a new weapon that could do this... I would have heard something... I'd know about it.
No, not anymore.
Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.
I think there are some things we should talk about.
... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
Don't look at me.  I'm just a pilot. I got you here... You've got to do the rest.
But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.
Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.
What's wrong?  What's happening?
What about the princess?
Yes, sir.
What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
I don't see how we're going to find anything out here.  This terrain is hopeless.
Why didn't you say so before.
It's only light that doesn't affect it.  Solid things, like rocks, can hurt it!  Fire above him!
You're a good pilot... I've learned a lot from you... I wish you...
A Wookiee broke loose up here, but we've subdued him... There is a lot of damage, and three, no four, casualties...
You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!
I am Luke Starkiller at your service.
I... I don't know.  I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help.  I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.
You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?
Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.
I read you sir.
Something... I've got...you don't.
Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.
Whad'ya talkin  about ?
Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character in Buenos Aires...
What's the hurry ?
Yeah, but I want Carmen.
Eight point... no, uh, seven...
Please continue, Sergeant.
Hope you're ready for more. We're going back to P to capture that Brain.
In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.
Well, whad'ya know...
I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet...
WHERE IS IT ?
Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ?
Let's disregaed rank... Everybody hear that ? Rank is not an issue here.
No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.
Good for you.
Who ?
Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
I don't want everyone to see.
Carl can wait.
None at all... We won.
He's nothing like you.
I love you, Carmen.
Do you mean it ?
A lot can happen in three minutes.
Sure.
Looks like rain.
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
I won't quit !
Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.
Well, yeah, sure...
On whose authority, Corporal ?
This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh ?
That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.
Uh, I don't know.
I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.
AAAAAAAAAAAA !
Who is V'ger?
The examination is a normal function.
The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet.
Our data is being prepared.
You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator.
Sir! Airlock four has been opened; a thruster suit is reported missing!
Yes.
None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.
You saved the ship.
We could have cut it off at the main computer...
It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...
I appreciate the welcome; I wish the circumstances were less critical.  Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder; keep a channel open to them.  Where is Captain Decker?
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu; ahead one third.  Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can't expect us <U>not</U> to look them over now!
We're losing the pattern...!
And whatever you sensed out here....
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
Captain, we have been seized by a tractor beam...!
Not for us?
Which will require twenty more hours at minimum, Admiral...
Warp Drive as soon as possible, Mr. Scott.
That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!
Evening, Annie.
Cal...
Then you'll be wet.
He'll eat potroast and like it.
You haven't heard of it.
First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642.
But, but but but...
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
So that the Old Mill, the Old <u>Mill</u> represents...the wheel of fate is that too...
That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've...
The <u>Firehouse</u>...
<u>How</u>...?
My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...
Thank you.
Because I'd met someone else.
I used to go out with a politician.
Where you going?
No, that's true.
How's your star?
What would you do with it, the printshop...
Press still works.
Sleep well?
...and we could get up every morning...
I can't do that.  If I tell them, they'll, if I <u>tell</u> them, they'll try Bob for rape, they'll...it'll ruin his career...
I've been thinking.
I have to tell you something...
Who is this person that you've found?
Maude, this <u>man</u> wrote this <u>play</u>!
Well, then, what's he doing here?
He had a hard day.  Ann's deserted him for some guy on the movie.
Cluster of events.  Don't see something, ten years, allasudden.  Three times inna night.
Town ain't got no courthouse.
He's on the ph...
Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast, he needs your confirmation on a request for money...?
...why am I here...?
I will.
She wasn't in the...
How'd you like working with Richard Hill?
Bourbon and Milk.
Nice town that you've got here.
She's a <u>waitress</u>.
Bob, Bob, stick to the business, will you?
Is Mr. Barrenger there...?
I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...
I've got scene <u>twelve</u>...  Shouldn't you be in school...?
I really think that <u>business</u>...matters should be discussed between you t...
She's absolutely r...
I, actually yes.
Who is that...?
Will you help me out...?
I know that, Claire.  I, we <u>all</u> know...
I...I...
...I can't do it, Wally...
I know, it's the hardest thing in the world, and it seems everybody wants...
Hello.
No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all.
What?
I perjured myself.  I told a lie, and I ruined my life. That's what I did...  I don't suppose you could help me with <u>that</u>, could you?  Turn back the <u>clock</u>, or something?  Give me back my, give me back my <u>purity</u>, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...?  But what <u>is</u> truth? Eh?  In't that the thing?  What <u>is</u> true?
Nope.  I'm just supposed to hold people's hands, while they die.  What'd you say your problem was...
Doug...
He didn't have to tell...
Hi.
You know, the rape, to...even to the accident...
I have to talk to you.  My wife...
Halo?  <u>Marty</u>?  What would they have used instead of an old mill?  We need it tonight.  Marty?  Yeah you were saying...?
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
I want to make a good film.
And maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill, I...
I've got a date.
You want me to lie.
I'm out.
The girl was in the car.
...the house, the 1835.  The original <u>kitchen</u>, of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires...
I'm gonna' bring it off.
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
Mmm.
Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>...
I have to tell you, I can not <u>express</u> to you how <u>happy</u>...
You hear that?
...the damn thing...
Bet you did.
Where are we?
I didn't say that.  Why would I say that?
Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.
It happens.
Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
But we do have a choice.  To make it better.  Instead of worse.
I hope it's the right kind.
We make mistakes.  And we forgive each other.  Because we love each other, very m...
I can't hear you.
Every time I'm on the lunch yard, and he's with twelve of his retarded <u>dorkface</u> little adoring out-crowd <u>henchmen</u>...
You wouldn't kiss him, huh?
Darling, I've been thinking about our little Brad problem?  And I think it's time we move to Plan B...
This is my daddy's house --
It's not to wear around, or any- thing, I'm <u>way</u> too young.  It's just for play.
Annabelle, I know you miss your mother.  So why don't you say hello.
Uh.  What is it?
No.
...EGGzactly.  I'm putting on my coat --  We are late.  We are seriously late.  Which means Mister Ben we've got to get you dressed --
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
Poof!  You're happy now.
Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.
People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>.  I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!
Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country. Like Canada.  Only smaller.
No.
Grammy had a different kind. There are lots of kinds.  Hers was very bad.
It's not good enough.
You say that like I don't know that.
People beat it, don't they?  All the time.
I have to get dressed.  My ex-husband has asked me to dinner.  God knows why, he was very mysteri...
Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit...
Because you don't really seem here.
I've been with someone for quite some time, and didn't feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly.  But after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her -- and the kids I might add -- she moved in last month.
Me too.
Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
Jackie stop.  We promised we never go there.
You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war.  But I'm doing this for <u>their</u> well-being.
I grew up, a little.  I'm ready for a life that's built around commitm...
To make it easier for them or you?
WE are over.
You're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us.  We should tell them together.
The great thing about life is that things keep changing.
We don't have any coffee.
What happened with Annabelle?  Has nothing I said gotten through to you?
No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...
I need practice.
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
She was angry at herself.
I don't know wh...
Moi?
Oh, my God.
So.  Hopeful.
You try to center on the big issues, y'know.  What it's all about.  What this whole trip has meant.  But then, the <u>really</u> big issues keep swamping y...
He's relentless.  A <u>major</u> asshole.
Hon, maybe your mom would like t...
It's just not the right time t...
That thing you said before.  Pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. Because of what you gave up for motherhood...
You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
You taught my child that I am some limp dick <u>loser</u>.  Who didn't <u>care</u> about her pain.
That's not wh...
You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?
See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity.  For some <u>real</u> growth.
And there will come <u>another</u> moment. When the stakes are <u>really</u> there. And she will look back on this.  And remember how good it felt.  How easy it was.
What's this about?  Because we <u>fought</u>?
Come on, a wuss like me?  The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?
Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
I just found out I have to go to Boston to get a deposition.  I might not be back until Saturday.
We make our lives, one step at a time.  We do the best we can.  The truth about the future?  A promise. Is only a hope.
I don't know what's wrong with that kid.
Don't ever say that.
You know...Stanley...
Even though it was only his cousins that were killed?
I'll be your guest!
Consuelo?
Yes.
But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
When I'm in high school I'm not going to play any football. I'm just going to concentrate on class rank.  What did you do in high school?
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
Mi Jesus…mi jesus…
But still, you can't be sure.
I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening…
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
Maybe he's that one in a million!
I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.
No.
Ni...
Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
Nigger, fuck me hard!
I hate reading.
I believe it.
Anything I might know about?
That's too bad.
I'm a documentary filmmaker.
How many?
Three.
Eight, six, and four.
How'd you get it?
It's my Dad's He hides it under some old TV Guides in his closet.
I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV.
I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just...a little nervous, I don't know why.
Yeah. I know.
You want some?
What for?
Whoopee.
He did?
Henry, what exactly are these crazed gunmen demanding?
Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
You understand that they're watching our every move right now--you think you're just going to sail away?
Well?
We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
This was taken when Richter was arrested in Washington state, 1985. He was charged with interstate arms trafficking, skipped bail, and has since been a fugitive.
How goes the roll call?
Something tells me you don't want to be on TV, friend.
Are you hungry?  We can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley.
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
Get your men to do it!
Of the separate chemicals--I don't know, uh, offhand--
What does that mean?
Now, Mister Ambassador.  In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone.  I intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.
Well, it has been explained to me that, if you add a thick Cobalt-Thorium-G jacket to a nuclear device, the radio- activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years.
The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
That's nonsense, and you know it!
And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.
Give that back to me.
I did that for your own good, fella.  Now I'm not going to pull rank on you.  When this is over, I'll be happy to step outside with you and settle this thing.  Right now my orders are to locate General Ripper and put him on the phone with the President.
Do you have any witnesses, Major?
Didn't they tell you?
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz...P...I...E... T...R...A...S...Z...K...I...E...W... I...C...Z.
Well, Mister President.
What kind of trouble?
Not exactly, sir.  You see, Colonel Puntrich at Air Command HQ received a call from him about twenty minutes ago.  He asked General Ripper if he had issued the Go-code and the attack order, and General Ripper said:  "Sure, the orders came from me.  They're on their way in, and I advise you to get the rest of Air Command in after them. My boys will give you the best kind of start, and you sure as hell won't stop them now."  Then he hung up.
Just a second, sir.  He's got films of the War Room in that thing!
Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.
You're a good officer, Major Mandrake.  You have a right to know.  It looks like we're in a shooting war!
What's the gun for, General Ripper?
Please don't take any notice of this weapon, Major.  I love all weapons, and as of late, I've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.
I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
But then, sir, why have you issued the order: Wing attack, Plan-R?
Ask away, Major.
Go on, Major.
Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
But, General, we're on our toes.  We haven't agreed to anything for years.  Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.
I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.
And I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know what the three-letter code is.
I want to talk to General Ripper.
We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.
You know what that'll do to our fuel consumption.
Maximum ECM.
Then this is it.
I'm sorry, Major Kong.  I guess I was way out of line.
Missiles!  Sixty miles off, heading in fast.  Steady track, they look like beam riders.
Yeah, I got it in the thigh.
Lieutenant Quiffer, we're all sorry you were hit, and we'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away.
No, this looks like the real thing.
Shoot, Lothar.
Release first safety.
Second safety.
Everything still checks out okay.
Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders.  And therefore, to disregard anything that doesn't come on the CRM-114.
I said that's the point!
Maybe the warning system's out.
Mn-hm.
In Group?
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
Yeah.
It's called "Burger Manifesto, Part One The Dialectical Expression of Testosterone." Isn't that a great title?
Your a nurse?
I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls.
Where are you-hoo?
Stuck with what guy?
You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?
No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.
No, I seriously doubt that Pony's gonna be in a limo.
Sorry.
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
Yeah, a long while. A long, long while.
Go!
You know what we should do? Go to the...
No, no, I wasn't trying.
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
No, I'm not worried.
Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious.
You know?
What, they're looking for her?
Look.
She's dead.
Oh, really? You wanna go look?
So, how was the ride, kids?
Buff.
Oh, my God, you found it. Thank you so much.  Did you get your tape?
Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.
You're a drunk and an idiot.
No, but I heard it was great.
You okay, man? You okay?
I didn't want to eat this much, man.
A Porsche.
You know, it was the biggest mistake of my life.
What was your name again?
I'm not a nice guy.
Taking care of business.
Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
Yeah, well, he's from a Third World country. He doesn't have it easy.
Jeff, Jeff, if you want to be alone with Pony, you know, that's, that's fine with us.
Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
What'd you do?
You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.
No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.
Wow. You did that for me?
Because I care, I'm a fucking fool?
Oh no, no. You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to me. You lied to me because you're gutless. You're a gutless, drunken looser.
Jeff! Come up here!
You know, this, what you're doing with your life...
God, I haven't seen you all day.
"The worst I can do is starve to death." Listen to you.
But do you stand for anything?
What? What do you stand for?
Can I talk here? Let me talk.
You know, all you know is what's good for you.
I would've stopped it.
Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better?
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...
No, it's not...
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.
What?
Yeah, really.
What?
No, man. Hey. No, you know what? Hey, it's you, man. It's, you know what, you know what it is? It's this tarpit of stupidity that we're all stuck in. It's this cell. It's this void, you know.
Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.
Get off my roof!
No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
No, she was just sitting there?!
Yeah. To go to school and, you know, paint, performances, paint.
Alright, alright already.
Jesus, Jeff.
If...
I hate it here. It's so ugly, it's like being dead. You got out of here, you know? I'm ready to go.
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
Ooh, wow, nice. Personal trainer? Very nice.
Oh, How'd she get back?
Yeah? Well, what'd she say?
If you hit me...
Your manager?
So where are you?
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
The fuck not?
You know the fuck not.
Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?!
Holy shit.
Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.
...He slices off the guy's ear, and I mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the --
Di, we're sorry.  We...
Oh my G-d, I read about this!  It's called a "pregnancy insanity."  Quick, she needs a sitz bath --
No.
So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.
Spit from your dad?
I'm sorry.
Anyway, last time I checked, you still had to have sex to have an orgasm.  And I know she ain't seen the lord on all fours - so I'm just saying.
"No" you're not sure or "No" I'm not fat?
Listen, Kansas, I know you dream of springing your mom some day...
Kansas!
Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.
She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.
Hello?
You're kidding.
Hello?
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
You got that big retarded girl down there?
I'll get them before "Touched by an Angel," don't worry.
Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.
You sure you wanna go there?
Grandma and Grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl.  They didn't want you to break out and come kidnap me.
Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?
My best friend got pregnant.
I know - that's what I said too. Anyway, we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank.
Kansas, I want you to meet someone special.
Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom!  Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  Now I have to add, "P.S. My mom's a dyke" too?
More proof God's a guy...
What the hell do you want?
I can tell her you're all tied up in the projection room.  I can give her the brush ...
Roll 'em.
Wait a minute.  This is the woman I love.  What's going on? Who was loaded?
I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?
Hurt feelings department.
What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?
I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --
With a wildly beating heart.
Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
Look, if you don't mind, I haven't got time to listen to the whole plot ...
I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.
You're tough, all right.
Oh, that.  It's from a friend of mine.  A middle-aged lady, very foolish and very generous.
Look at this street.  All card- board, all hollow, all phoney. All done with mirrors.  I like it better than any street in the world.  Maybe because I used to play here when I was a kid.
Was I?  I'm sorry.
From Artie.  What's wrong?
Why did she call me?
I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?
I'm trying to tell you.  This is an enormous place.  Eight master bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every bathroom.  There's a bowling alley in the cellar.  It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do.  A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself?
That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?
Gordon Cole?
We've missed you too, dear.
I had some trouble with my car. Flat tire.  I pulled into your garage till I could get a spare. I thought this was an empty house.
It is not.  Get out.
I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color.
They're dead.  They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world.  But that wasn't good enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too.  So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...
And you have written pictures, haven't you?
How long is a movie script these days?  I mean, how many pages?
I will not have it butchered.
Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.
You can stay here.
How about some evening clothes?
I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.
I was a little worried about the line of my throat.  This woman has done wonders with it.
No you didn't.  You took the car.
I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night...
You don't believe me?  Look in the garage.
Sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us.  That car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there's going to be fireworks.
Don't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach?  Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo- Romanoff rut, you're through.
Was it a sudden quarrel?  Had there been any trouble between you before?
If it was a quarrel, how come you had the gun right there?
Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.
Who?
But the Power Source, Zaltar.
Why did she have to show up now?
What do I do?  I don't know her name.
Wait...don't leave me in here...
What's happening?
You love me?
I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.
Let me kiss you.
You're not afraid are you?
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
Miss what?
Are you asking me for a "date"?
What?
How do I fight it?
No thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll vouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks for my memoirs.
She's right. They'll string her up.
A little.
To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.
And you think you're in love.
Why should I believe you?
Guess! Go on.
You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks too pretty to eat.
Theories?
Someone's chasing him.
I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't let any of this go on. Not for one minute.
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
You bet your ass.
Why didn't you tell me?
Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.
What's a tree?
It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.
There isn't any.
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
She did that deliberately.
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
It doesn't seem right.
What's it like?
They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.
I was on Earth...
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
Why?
Then teach me how.
Then come with me.
Not enough vodka in it.
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.
You're welcome...??
You...um...you never got married?
You thought that?
I just can't stand this.
But all he had was chocolate milk.
Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
Gee, I haven't laughed like that since -- since --  I really can't remember when.
That's the biggest change in Smallville, you know. They've taken over this town. Everybody who isn't actually working for Wheat King -- like I do -- is out there --  on a Wheat King thresher.  Do you think I could do it? Do you?
Call me.
Mr. Kent, could I ask you something?
Say!
So, Mr. White? Can I go ahead and make my travel arrangements?
I'd better be. Suddenly I've got competition to keep up with.  Your high school reunion article. I though it was terrific. And fascinating.  Especially about the girl back home.  I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.
The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is --
The only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint--  -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast!
Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
How many sugars?
Please, Mr. Webster, you're a great humanitarian. Ain't you heard what it's like in them jails? You send an innocent boy in and he gets thrown in with killers and robbers and rapers and raper killer and robber rapers and...
Yes! That never occurred to me.  Her ya go, buddy, single-malt.  Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.
Under different company names. I control the price of coffee beans in Brazil. The price in Venezuela. Java, South Korea, North Korea, the Aleutian Islands, Guam, Bolivia, and the Republic of Gabon!
Turn on the T.V.
Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.
And then shut down the pipe lines.
Is this whitemail?
A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans.  Blueprints.
What will it do?
But a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it.
Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.
Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
Today coffee----
Small potatoes.
Wait a minute! She's right! Kryptonite. I remember reading about it in an interview with him.  Nuts...
I do?
Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.
A "complimentary corsage."
Superman? Oh, was he here?
Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
I was right. you are Superman.
You don't have anything to be sorry 	about.  How could I . . .
I didn't think I wanted to.
Let's go to my place.
Don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you didn't know . . .
Does she know about it? She's in it!
A bikini! I'll need to buy a new bikini, Lex.  C'mon. After being cooped up in that prison, haven't you thought about me in a bikini . . ...once maybe ?
It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
A gang of terrorists seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris
I can't understand it! Where is he? I mean, he shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree, and  now he decides to pull a disappearing act?
What do you want?
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
Yes, but will you honor it?
Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
Then we must go there too.  To rule. Finally - to rule!  And then you shall have what you want.
What shall we do now?
This "super" man is nothing of the kind. I have discovered his weakness.
It's brilliant. Daddy thinks so, too. You'll write a new series -- 'Metropolis After Hours.'
I really don't think . . .
No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
Then prove it. Lois is doing an interview with Superman about his peace mission . . .
Gee, I'm really sorry.
Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.
It must have been a super effort to get out of bed, Clark.
Lex, we all appreciate how you've supported us lately and . . . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we've decided to increase your commission to 12 percent.
Would you mind taking a walk with me?
He missed the door, Uncle Lex.
Whoa. . .
You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.
Hey! He looks . . . normal.
Don't worry honey, I'm sure he'll make a swell husband.
Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
Superman. . .  But you're... dead!
Thank you.
I'd like to.
Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick.
Look, there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce.
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
Oh, what a chance! If I could just  --  get to him.
Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms?
Me and my real estate? How  many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this?
My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land."
I know that. Bu tin this case he was right. Arnold 'Buster' Luthor, the most inept check forger of his time --  A pity he didn't live to see his son strike out for the big city. A pity he didn't live to see how, from humble beginnings, I created an empire.
Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
Speaking of feeding things, what about dinner?
You think he's for real?
Mr. Romance...
We just take it?
About Vesuvius. About Superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano.  Ahh, the look on his face when he saw that Kryptonite. When will I see another, y'know? Y'know?
Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
There was a recipe on the back  --
Where's mine?! Where's my parachute?
Then -
Will you abide by the Council's opinion?
What's your name, boy?
Got all A's this year. Teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the -
He will be odd, different.
There are none of them any good anyway.
The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
How much do you weigh?
What about this X-Ray vision of yours?
Can you really see through anything?
Uh-huh.
Where do you hail from?
I gave him steady employment --
Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
They'll soon be over.
Ally.  That was my nickname.
Not really.  The last time I saw her was at that clinic.  That was a long time ago.
Which clinic?
Alison.
Case?
I'll be back around nine.
She's resting.  In her room.
Because it's what we have to do.
So?  I mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers.
Yes.
I stopped by the station a while ago.  I stared at the bus.  I could almost hear the kids inside.  There was a lawyer there.  He told me he'd gotten you signed up.  Is that true?
And they loved Bear.
Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...
You've talked to Billy?
Is he coming over now?  Right away?
It's like a song.
Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats...
Because...he wanted to them to be punished.
That you didn't die?  Like the other children?
I don't want you to lie.
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
I have no questions.
Do you have a room?
Is this it?
Perfect.
A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.
Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window?  How old was I, Daddy?  Five or six?  I got absolutely soaked, remember?
The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.
Yes.
What is it?
We do.
Who are you?
I'm a lawyer.
Excuse me?
There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods.  And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual.  I remember that.  I'm remembering it pretty clearly.
Before the actual accident?
This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?
Seventy-two miles an hour.
You believe that the bus driven by Mrs. Driscoll was going at seventy- two miles an hour at this time?
You mean it?
Of course.
The ramp?
Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.
Partly.  But there's a lot the insurance doesn't cover.  That's one of the reasons we have a lawyer.  To make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest.
I don't know.
There's talk of that.
It's compensation, Leo, for the marginal life we lead.  Sidney, did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?
Will you mind your own business!
Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now.  See you two kids later!
No, I wouldn't...
Does he have to be here in our hair?
You hear that, Susie...  Continue please...
If looks could kill, I'm dead...
But my day with Susie isn't over yet and--
Sidney is a liar!
You know, dear, we're drifting apart, you and I, and I don't like that.
No...
I just checked "downtown".  Quiet everywhere tonight.
Say, that's good - it's nice - in fact, it's APT, Harry!
Match me, Sidney...
Spahish...that must show he likes "spigs", too.
You want something done, J.J., but I doubt if you yourself know what's involved.
Not "we", Sidney, you!
Yes.  With your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.
Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
Presumably yours...  That's according to St. Dallas.
What are you so chipper about?  If I put a cross on every one of your mistakes, you'd look like a graveyard!
You're incapable of the truth...
What do you want all of a sudden - Lady Godiva...?  Where's my other shoe?
If that's for me, tear it up!
That's no way to talk...
Why not you?
- and I just had to drop by and tell you how great I thought you were.
But you didn't do much about it, Susie.  You walked out, and there I was...solo...and not too good at that.
But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time!  I was born only yesterday!...
Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
What does that mean?
You sure?
Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?
Why?
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
She intends to change the future somehow.
Drive for a minute.
I'm sorry, John.
It, John.  Not him.  It.
I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.
Yeah.  Drag, huh?
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
John, get out of the way!!
I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.
I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.
It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.
Can it be destroyed?
I'll bet. Makes you a more efficient killer, right?
My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.
Why him?
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
Why attack Russia?
Relax now, Sarah --
And no elbows on the table!
I'm Steve. What's your name?
David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.
I guess it's possible.
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
No can do.
I have a duty.
My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler. They arrested the plotters and their families.
Your mother, too.
Steve.
I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?
Do you know where the Adagio begins?
Of course.
I'm sorry but I have to leave. I'll find other work. You'll have to get someone else, that's all.
I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?
What telegram?
Think carefully, Wilhelm... maybe not in your own name, but as Privy Councillor or Vice-President.
Then you are wrong.
How can I know such a thing?
I'll ask the questions, Helmuth.
Do you know Hans Hinkel?
Helmuth.
One of your people told me.
And ask him about his private life.
Goebbels, yes, Josef Goebbels said, 'There's not a single filthy Jew left in Germany on whose behalf Dr. Furtwängler has not intervened.' No, no one could have been less of a Nazi than Dr. Furtwängler.
Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
You were in insurance before the war.
No, I was never a Nazi, I have no interest in politics, I'm a musician -
Mission control to Chuck, come in...
Aren't I worth waiting for?
I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
Any one of them's ideal for home defense. Which'll it be?
You must have a girlfriend.
That's none of your business.
Do you understand?
So, it's from the future, is that right?
The what?
Stop!  I don't want to know. Hold still.  So...it was John that ordered you here?
You volunteered?
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.
What about it?
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
Is this enough?
My whole life has been combat.
Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?
It's better that way.
I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said...
I didn't build the fucking thing.
Surrounded by living tissue.
Why were the other two women killed?
...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...
Here, drink some of this...
Sarah.  Sarah, this is Dr. Silber- man.  I'd like you to tell him everything Reese said to you.  Do you feel up to it?
Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep.  It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands.
Give me the short version.
Did you reach the next girl yet?
Will you really hold me to it over <u>pennies</u>?
It probably will.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time.  Why should I settle for that?
You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...
What are you babbling about, psycho?
This is nuts.
Where are you going?
Long story.  I found this key in the mouth of a wooden Harlequin.
Read what it says: "Warning, do <u>not</u> attempt to open.  If elevator stops, use emergency... "
"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
There's a ladder here.
What's C.R.S.?
A fresh shirt...
I know the owner of Campton Place.  I could talk to him in the morning.
The maitre d' called you Christine.
I have a confession to make.  Someone gave me six-hundred dollars to spill drinks on you, as a practical joke.
Seriously?  What did they say?
How?  How could they have gotten anything?
What did you say?
Scams, con games.  How many?
What are you <u>doing</u> here?
I'm back from the dead.
Stop talking...
Nicholas...
Like... where are you from?
Originally, Connecticut.
One brother, one sister.
Studied acting, I assume?
Underwear?
Happy Birthday, man.
So do you.  And to think I was worried...
Never better.
No.
It doesn't stop, Nick.  I paid the bill, I gave 'em their money, but it all started again.  They won't leave me alone...
Really?
Oh, God yes please.  Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.
It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends.  If I could have you back in my life... in some small way.  It would be important.
Happy Birthday, Nicholas.
I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...
A game?
We provide whatever's lacking.
How long will these take?
Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
Where'd you pick up your checks?
Guess!
Ah, Mr. Van Orton.  Here you go...
Didn't I give you two?
I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?
I don't know what you're talking about.  What's happened?
Your mother thought he was a good man.  He worked very hard.  What I remember most was his manner was so... slight.  It was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.
The Hinchberger wedding.
I'll send your regrets.  Honestly, why must I even bother?
What's happened...
Find out about a company called C.R.S.  Consumer Recreation Services.
You're joking.
What?
Well, I... uh...
Couldn't get the last ones.  You?
Welcome Home Eleanor.  Welcome Home?  I've never been here.  Who did this?
Modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations.  You brought us here to scare us.  Insomnia, that was just a decoy issue.  You're disgusting.
It's a question.
Well, this lot is full!
We're fucked.  We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning.
Nell!
It's still an electric shock!
And after she was thrown out, she needed a job.
I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
The cold sensation.  Who felt it first?
Nell!  What's wrong?
What did it smell like?
All right...
And then what happened?
Are you coming to confess?
Why?
That?  That's Hill House.
Have either of you seen David Watts?
When do we take the tests?
Your fear of him was real.  That's all the ghost anyone needs.
Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
They're so beautiful.  Aren't they?
Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much.  Light sleeper.
I'm between jobs right now.  My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over.  So... And you?
A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?
A monster?  But he built this for the woman he loved, like the Taj Mahal.
If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him.
David.
Is it over?
I don't know what to think anymore.
I don't think I want any.
What'd you come back for, babe?
Then what good is he?
Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
As soon as you get dressed.
What's the matter?
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
Hey.
I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
You should have let me do the talking.
Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
Where do <u>you</u> think he is, Mike.
No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.
Huh?
Yeah?
Man knows what he likes.
No reason.
I go to work, try to keep my life together, put all that shit behind me, man.  What d'you want from me.
What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
Five years, I think.  Long time.
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
No one else is even here yet.
What post office?
I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro.  Got three callbacks.
Well, those are the breaks.
You just cooking then?
Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?
Not her brand.
In any case, I don't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel.
Sewing mailbags?  Me?  Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. Wasn't about to start when I was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands.
Sounds like Beverly Hills.
I can't believe Jenny told you all that. About me.  She was always so embarrassed.
Disappointed.
You weren't disappointed in her, then.
I might've been away for the weekend.
I should really give him a call.  He's a character, isn't he.  Well, not to you. I meant to us squares in the outside world.
Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing.  Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure.
I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
She told you all about my details but not about his.  Lovely.
It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement.  Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one.  SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.
I was inside once.  I punched a cop at a demo.
Overnight.  What about just now?
Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill.  Watching Doris Day.
Never thought of that.  Busman's holiday.
Valentine had himself a party, I hear.
Yeah, that's right.
Hey.
Which kind?
Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
She's nice lookin'.
Something's on.
What?
I miss my kids.
It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again.  I can't believe this.
Pleasure.
What.
A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else.
Hello, Rachel.
You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest--
Oh, Mr Crane--
I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.
Ah yes, a music lover.
Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
...she can go up there.
A goose, friend. I was chasing a wild goose. Ed, have you ever heard of venture capital?
Sure.
Maybe.
I got the paperwork here. Partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I supply professional services, you supply the capital. I'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh?
...Were you in the service, Ed?
I guess it would be pretty awkward.
Your place?
...Huh?
Come on, get ready. It's important.
I know all about that. But I don't know how much to tell them.
Look, I don't wanna waste your time so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind? *You* don't mind. So while I'm in town I'll be staying at the Hotel Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah, it's goofy, the suites're named after operas; room's OK though, I poked around. I'm having 'em hold it for me on account of I'll be back and forth. In addition to my retainer, you're paying hotel, living expenses, secretarial, private eye if we need to make inquiries, headshrinker should we go that way. We'll talk about appeals if, as and when. For right now, has she confessed?
No. Of course not. She didn't do it.
Good! That helps. Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!--one less thing to think about. Now. Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell *you* what to say. No talking out of school. What's out of school? Everything's out of school. I do the talking; you keep your trap shut. I'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything. Understood?
...OK.
I knew about it. Big Dave told me about it, and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money.
I don't know. I don't think so.
Not guilty, your honor...
Oh, hell. Drink?
OK. Boy. Jesus!
Yeah. What do I, uh...
Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm...
Well, the best, the money-is-no-object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't know how you're fixed for money.
Uh-huh. He's the, uh...
Yeah.
Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
Jesus...
Yeah.
This hair.
Yeah.
No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away.
That's very generous.
Uh-huh.
...I'm Crane.
Not an owner.
I'm telling you, something's wrong. I still haven't heard from Pendergast.  I think you should call it off.
Do they have to wear uniforms?
Battery's dead.  Shit.
For Chrissake, I'll do it.  What's the combination?!
D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.
Where the hell are you?
I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story.  Nice touch.
I smell it.  It's here.
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.
Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
Yes.  Bit of a shock.  But as Cuthbert so tactfully put it, the museum needs new blood.  And since I've been here since the Mesozoic Era --
Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
I'm coming with you.
Thank you for taking the time to help us with this, Dr. Frock.
Something tried to get into this room!
It's from John.  Those two arrows were his insignia.  It's addressed to Louis Moriarty, a patron who financed his expeditions.
Read it out loud.
You work here?
I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?
Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
We're not supposed to go back there.
Shut them up!
Oh no.  I smell it.
That's impossible.
What do you make of it, Margo?
So what?
Got to finish this thesis sometime.
If he were alive he'd have contacted me.
Yes.  Once.  We met at Columbia.  John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there.
How did you know that?
Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for?
No.  I'm all right.  I won't let this affect me anymore.  John wouldn't get help.  His ego endangered the lives of others.  His theory came first.
Something came up in autopsy tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.
Where would we find it?
I don't know.
We have to try and draw it off!
What?
<i>A month.</i>
--and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role.  I really must congratulate you on writing Kirk back in.  A master stroke.
We've become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions, bored with pyrotechnics and special effects.  While the world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's nothing fake about Truman himself.  No scripts, no cue cards.  It's not always Shakespeare but it's genuine.  That's how he can support an entire channel.
But how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps?
All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.
You've never actually met Truman, yourself.  Never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?
A show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
Actually, I'm free Sunday.
Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.
I'm thinking of getting out, Marlon.
Yeah?  Outta what?
I've got to talk to you.
I think I'm mixed up in something.
I think it's got something to do with my dad.
Could be.  Beard looks phony.  It's when I'm unpredictable.  They can't stand that.  That's why we've got to get out of here.  Can you come with me?
So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head--?
...personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...Naturally, I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...<i>risks?</i>...  ...sure I'm aware of the risks--why else do you think I would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company...?
What's that?
And then what, Truman?  We'd be back to where we were five years ago.  You're talking like a teenager.
It'd be an adventure.
What did you want?
What do I do?
It's hard to go places, isn't it?
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
Stop this now.  I'll do it.  I swear.
I'm looking for my wife--Nurse Burbank. It's important.
Now what?
Were you there--how do you know?
I don't understand.
We don't even know you.
Yup.
Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --
-- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --
What is it you find incredible?
Incinerate it. Like the others.
My lateness may have well been absence. A course has already been taken.
What's that?
We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington.
How'd you find me?
And what's that?
You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
You found something?
What do you think?
Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
What's wrong, Scully?
You're looking for a bomb.
Jesus, Mulder...
Scully...
Where are you, Mulder?
Something's not right...
They were the ones that put us together.
I wake you?
It's like jelly.
What kind of infection?
Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.
How was it contracted?
And where are they going with it?
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
Where would they be going?
It may be extraterrestrial.
Been where?
What? What happened?
...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
She's missing. We've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years.  Or it may not.
We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?
Sing a song of sixpence...
Sing a song of sixpence.
Catherine?  I'm about to start.  If you want me to wait, or...
You don't know the procedure.
Agent Novak?
It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like "remorse."
Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
What difference does it make...?
They're hungry.
No problem.
She the one from Santa Cruz?
I have done this, you know.  Been inside.
Prevacid.  For my stomach.
Awaiting his arrival.
I need it.
We'll go back to his house, Pete. There's still a lot to do.  Analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records.  Maybe he owns property somewhere.
Den leuten.
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
...to steal my girl.
It's just what he used to say.
A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.
Let's not get into any more trouble.
...you know.
...and my lover. He was Harry.
...again.
Of course I didn't tell Calloway.
Why are you lying?
...quarrel?
Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.
He works in a military hospital.
Yes.
We are interested in this case. Have you arrested the girl?
Yes, of course.
My name is Calloway.
Yes.
Holly Martins.
Must have known I was broke. Even sent me an airplane ticket. It's a shame.
What?
What the devil?
Miss Schmidt.
Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
Do you see what that means?
Bring him in.
How about the doorway?
...of Santa Fe."
I'll look it up for you.
Heard of Harry Lime?
Who?
Very popular, sir.
...leaving tomorrow, sir.
Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...
She's been arrested.
Did the police believe you?
Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind.
You've got plenty of contacts.
I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
You really liked it?
Are you mad?
Vinkel.
...he was. Yes, for a short time, while they carried him across the road.
You remember me? Upstairs...
...Popescu...
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
You don't mean that doctor?
Now, hold on.
Yes, it is.
He probably knows a lot more than that. Somebody's lying.
What's the purpose of your visit here?
Richard. Hi.
Traveler.
He will not take us to the island. It's in the National Park and it is forbidden to go there. But we are allowed to travel to this one to stay for one night.
And you, if you had come out of Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf.
Read the early Zionists on European Jewry; they sound like Goebbels.
Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson?
What do you care?
Fire...
I have a job.
No, they don't. Not the smart ones.  Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.
I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I drive a fork-lift.
Why no silencer?
How come so many of the books are in Spanish?
Do you know it like that? By heart.
Why not?
Where are they?
And belief follows?
Look, just light the candles with me. Then we'll eat. You have to eat.
Miriam called, looking for you. She said you might come, so I...
Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?
I doubt it. How did you find out?
Danny, the night we met, you said the name Ilio Manzetti. We were impressed. We were excited. But here it is September, and Mr. Manzetti is still walking around breathing the air.
More cultural than political.
And? WHat did you notice?
You work for the <i>New York Times</i>. Your whole job in life is not to understand things like me.
A forty-five.
So are you... But they'll believe you....  Lina Moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. That you proposed it in a meeting at her house.  Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's dead? Do you really want to kill Jews? You want to kill me?
Don't tell me what I --
From the Rhineland originally.
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
No, I don't admit it's stupid.
I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like --
Open it up.
I didn't. I told you, I can't --
What are you trying to say?
Who's this?
And that's when the Mets started to stink.
So what?
Are you out of your mind?!
Eat shit....
In the Third Reich, weren't a number of high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin?
He's shy, not like Enzo.
Are you going to keep it?
No.
But your man isn't quite a God!
Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
No!
Yes.
This is a great pleasure.
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
And the lights!  Running lights, stealing stretchers...!  You'll have us in jail.
Damn it!  Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
Roberto?  How long?
Plenty of women everywhere right?
Noireuter.
It's nothing.  It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman!  How is the little Frenchman?
I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?
I don't have one.
It's okay.
Not at all!
Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions.
No, I have to ask you a favor...  You're the only one who'll understand.
Here...  Here...
You still collect them?
... I was seventeen, I loved her so much I tried to die for her. Two years later I couldn't even remember her name!  Let me tell you, time erases everything!
I don't want to erase anything.
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
Who?
I recognize you.
You're going to be very busy these days aren't you?
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
No.  I want to show you.  Is it ruined?
She's not like the others.  She can't stand to be away from the sea.
Why?
Well, then, talk to me some more.
I'm being a pain, huh?
You sure?
Bonjour Monsieur... Louis. 
Jacques?  I'm pregnant.
Anything.
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
Why don't you ask me?
Where are you from, Henrietta?
Again?
Well?
What?
How was your trip?
No.  I'm just depressed.
They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet.
... And those?
Who... Who is that?
It depends.  He should come up soon.  Unless he's decided to stay for the night.
Okay, okay.  You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?
Wait!  Professor...?
I'll go see how he's doing.
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
It's Esther. Santa's got her.
What do you want me to do?
From the way she carried herself I could tell she'd been around the block a few times...
Sorry. I'm better with men.
Keep going.
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
Shabat Shalom mama. I brought some Manischewitz. The black label.
...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community.
But we're not open on Sundays.
Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.
Sorry folks, I don't do couples.
No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
What's going on? Why'd he stop?
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
Sure.
Who?
See you tomorrow —-
You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...
She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
There is no danger at all. It's a wild animal. Do you think a wild animal prefers walls, streets and people when it can get into open country?
Yes?
That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
Charlie and I were talking. That's one reason I wanted to see you.
Charlie doesn't think the leopard killed the girl in the cemetery.
Come on, Charlie. Let's go find another and better suspect.
He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.
It was you, Galbraith!
It's better you don't know.
Why did you give up teaching?
Wait ——
Why?
That's a fact, isn't it?
Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
On his back, I suppose.
Are you all right?
I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.
What did he have to do -— look at the body?
Jerry, these flowers aren't really for me ——
Kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
I got into a little crap game.
All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways —
I know. What do you think I felt when you said, "don't be soft?"
It's a lovely town —- it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened.
Hot...  These roads all round here, closed to the public... Why’s that? Military bases?  Huh. I guess there’s space enough for war games... Must be good for business.
Oh-oh! Touché, Mr Lombard! But tell me, what would you know about sisterly love, eh?  No. Don’t. You might get confused speaking of things you don’t understand and we need you clear- headed, at least until you’ve done what we are paying you for.
Excuse me?
Oh no. You’ll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
Mr Lombard?
Just a moment...  Go ahead.
The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. I’ll give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
I’m really sorry you were not called...
I’ve had a long and unpleasant day. I’m tired and I’m angry. But mad? Not yet.  I paid Leon’s boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why haven’t you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh?
My brother hung himself.
Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? He’s a client of mine and a friend of your husband.
Leon hung himself...
I doubt Friedman ever even met Leon, Deborah. Friedman dealt with select customers. As for my envelope, had he know where it was he wouldn’t have mistaken me for a hitman called Lamont when we met in Los Angeles.
Good.
I didn’t know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!
Something like that.
We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But it’s never that complicated really.
My husband didn’t need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered...
To get me killed...?
Do you think we’d let him get away with the murder of my brother?
Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight.
A call box? That’s odd. Where exactly?
Europe...  France. I’m French but I live in London...  ... England.
Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why can’t you go back there?
Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr...
Lombard...  It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile I’d sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...
A criminal?
Huh... I have no... ... hard evidence...
I’m finished here and I’m tired, Emily. You shouldn’t be here. Now don’t make it worse.
A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think I’ll get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, it’ll be too late.
Look at him, Whitney. Come all the way from England to clean up California. Huh!
Emily...
Shit! Fuck! What’s fucking wrong with people!  I’m going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to! 
May I have your phone number?
On the bed!
Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
Where are the kids?
What company?
Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. He’s got a safe...  I need a doctor...
What about the staff?  They’re in on what’s going on, aren’t they?  How many of them?
Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that?
Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many. 
Well, I hope you’re not too heartbroken and...
What if it is?
Check with your son’s bank. Banks don’t usually give out information about their customers.
The room’s yours for 24 hours. It’s sound- proofed, stocked up with food, drink and other things you might find useful. You can do anything you like.
I don’t know what your problem is, but...
Am I supposed to know him?
Where is Friedman?
Friedman lives with you at the Ambassador?
Have you?
Shut up! Where’s your wallet?
Should I be?
I’m afraid I don’t understand.
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
He showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street...
Fine...
Welcome to the club.
Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
Yeah. Why? You’re going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good?
J’ai bien peur qu’il te faudra attendre.  Pas avant la matinée.
Then why don’t you reach him?
We are so alike, Xavier. Still, sometimes I wonder which one of us is the ugliest.
If he had, you’d be dead.
What do you think, huh?
Not even scum like Friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call.
Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasn’t easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, what’s your business with these Spitzes?
Are they still operative?
What do you mean?
Why not you -- Jean d'Aulon?  The only man who's poorer than I am, and so the only man I can trust. Dignified, honorable, wise... what more could we ask of a king?
We have to do something before she tries it again!  I beg of you, my lord, don't let her down... let me organize an escape...
But not impossible... Gilles and La Hire are ready to risk everything to save her...
What do you fear most now... my sword?  ... or his hands?
Yes, I am.  I'm an archer who can read and write.  Who do you want to write to?
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
If you really want to help me, there's one thing you can do.
Tell me...
I will ask my voices... if they come back one day.  Meanwhile... I'm going to Compiegne.
No, of course not... I never killed anyone...
No!  I warned the English to go back home -- I begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat I would bring on them... why didn't they listen to me?
Yes, maybe... I don't remember...
And when was that?
Arrest them!
Who's running this trial, you or her?  I can't believe it!  This wretched girl -- how dare she speak to us like that?
Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is.  This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
Are you alright?  Did they hurt you?
I will hear you... but not now, not here.
You will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked.
It is for us to determine whether you are a good Christian, not you.
Please... may I have it back...
Good day, sir.  I trust my honorable Duke of Burgundy is feeling well?
20,000?!  But... I heard King Charles was... financially embarrassed.
Why did you betray me?  Paris was ours for the taking!  All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?
She pretends she's been sent by God! These charlatans -- it's a pity there isn't enough wood to burn them all!
You mustn't see her, my lord.  We know nothing about her... we don't even know if she is from Lorraine.
Not exactly.  She wants you to give her an army -- at your expanse.  Bearing in mind that your mother stole every last piece of gold in the treasury, I fail to see how you can afford such an adventure.
I can see her if I want to.  I mean, with half of France in the hands of the English, what have I got to lose?
He's probably right -- let's call a delay...
I... I don't know... it'll sound like we... betrayed her...?
Yes.
Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
Brilliant idea... but to be really effective, why not send a whole army of virgins?
I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!
And... what does Jeanne think?
Jeanne, look behind you.
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?
But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?
Did your voice tell you to jump?
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
Yeah...
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
I swear I'll never swear again in my life if you save her life!  But I'm warning you, if you let her die, then you're the biggest...
Who gave you that horse?
Five steeds and a few hackneys...
Who... who are you...?
I don't know... I thought...
No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!
Because!  Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...
No!  I don't want to know anymore! Leave me alone!  I didn't kill that man!
No, no, you did fine.  I'd even say well done.  Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
I -- I cleaned up my room, look... and I said my prayers... all of them... and...
I don't think so.
Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?
Good, good.  And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?
I'm sorry - I was given this address. I'm looking for a Mr--  -- a Mr Dzikiewicz.
Let me see this.
Must feel better this side of the wall.
Get your things together, you have to leave!
And suppose they take the table away?
Mama, that was a great dinner.
Of course they'll notice it. But look--  This is a good place for something.
That's better than yesterday.
It's not funny.
Yes, so did the Germans.
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
You're amazing, Jehuda.
Can you help? I've no money...
Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
Dirty pig!
I was listening, Kitten.
It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
Out of Warsaw.
What the hell are you doing?
I am... I was a pianist.
What about you?
I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.
Well you stopped combing your hair, which is a good thing, it was looking over done.  You see these are the slits that the heads will go through, show him Nessie ... they'll be dead, the Reverend is going to use animal blood, no doubt it will be very dramatic. Tea! 
What would you think if someone played a kitchen table like it were a piano?
He is quite altered, as if they had been trying some native witchcraft on him. Well tomorrow or the day after he will be gone.
My REAL father was a famous German composer
Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.
Which mountains are those dear?
I got the good wife for you Peini. She pray good. Clean. Read Bible. You sleep her Peini. She chief daughter.
She looks tired.
On your property?
And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
Spoken words?
We can't leave the piano
Hello, then.
Do I know any gigs?
I'm lookin' for a guy on the lam from a counterfeiting rap.  Thought he mighta come in here.
Which way are the rooms?
What are ya gonna do, call the cops?
What do we do?
You're late.  Where you been?
I had some appointments.
I checked the place out.  There weren't no dicks in there.
You think my play is bad?
...It's the only reason I ain't quit before now.
I'm gettin' too slow for this racket.  I done the best I'm gonna do.  You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.
What are you talkin' about?  We just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  We can do anything we want now.
Aw hell, you sound like some goddamn sucker.  You know everything I know.  You got nothin' more to learn from me.
I'm out, Johnny.
We had a few problems with the Law this morning.  The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good.  Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.
You the Duff that didn't come up with his end when Little Jeff was sent up?
You could buy yourself some things. Clothes, or a nice car...
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
You want the stuff tomorrow or don't ya?  It's gonna take hours just to clean it up.  Besides, Gondorff's still a hot item.  Where am I gonna be if he gets hit?
We bought ya a tap into Moe Anenberg's wire.  He's got eyes at every track in the country.  You'll get race results, odds, scratches, pole positions, everything; and just as fast as Western Union gets 'em.
You sober?
He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?
Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric.  Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
You gonna stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat?
No signs of trouble?
You think he'll show?
Take it easy, you won't lose him now.  We had him 10 years ago when he decided to be somebody.  Believe me, I've seen enough to know.
Looks like he's sulking.
I'm not sure I know it.
Raise 1,000.
Never get enough, huh pal?  I'd think you'd get tired of losin', Honnigan.
Excuse me, sir.  Treasury Dept... I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Then I'm afraid we'll have to impound your money until we're sure that it's all good.  Can I see your wallet and your ticket, please?
Thank you.  You don't know how much I appreciate this.
She don't work here no more.  I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.
I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
All right, when?
What's the matter?  You gotta get back to Shaw?
If you help me out, I'll pay ya back the money you owe Shaw, myself.
And you were gonna pay me back?
Not yet, but...  Hey, there's only a grand here.
How am I gonna do that?
Will you wait until the chump is played?
I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
You weren't hired to miss him.
There wasn't any way he coulda known we was in there.  We made a clean pick on the lock and didn't leave no footprints in the hall. Somebody musta wised him up.
Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. I spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off.  But it's not gonna happen this time.  We're not even gonna let the police know we're here.  If you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya.  And you better take it, cause I can make ya work for us without it.
Why not?
You know how they are... sex...
Is that what it means?
All settled?  Grand!  Why did your mother ever divorce him?  He's swell.
She's got me worrying, too.
Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.
Nothing.
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
Not that scrawny little....? 
was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks.  Why don't you drop around?
Yes.
Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
I don't know.
Yes, she would.
Only in bad weather.
Do you mind if I come down and see it?
Yes.  I might not have been shot.
I'm asking you.
You've been there?
Nothing yet to cinch it.
No.
Get anything?
Rosebreen.
Are you kidding?
Well, what?
Did you go?
You did!
That's ridiculous.
You'd done better to have told me that in the beginning.  Where were you the afternoon she was knocked off?
What are you going to do?
You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
You're going to return every cent of it!
I can't! I haven't got it!
Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.
What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
No word at all?
Because I don't believe that Clyde's dead!  Why, you said yourself you saw him last night.
Perfectly absurd.
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted - 
Morelli -  You knew Julia.  Was she gypping Wynant?
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
Pretty girl.
What hit me?
I can't lie here.  I've got to get up and trim that darned Christmas tree.
What are you drinking?
Someone get a doctor.
No.  It's a Christmas present.
Hello... send him up.
But Wynant --- ?
He's just been for a walk.
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
Several things.  Hello, Fred.  We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions.  Oh, and coffee.
Huh?
Yes!
Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
Honest, Mr, Charles.  I never touched that safe.  Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.
I'm sorry.  Tanner, don't you want some wine?
I'm going to give her a wedding present.  Thought I'd better do it now, before I forget it.  I can drop them on my way to...  That's funny....  Where are those bonds?
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
Where are you going?
This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
They stopped.
We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!
Maybe we are crazy for doing this.  But if we do it, we do it right.  I just needed to explain that in a way I wouldn't have to do it again.
I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
All right.  Let's get out of here.
What do you figure it to be?
Maybe I do.
Says he wanted food.  Liar.  He wanted the gold.
You don't know that.
Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
I have to answer him.
I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
Blow me.
Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.
You're such a pussy, you know that? How'd you get in the army?
It's not about being fun.  It's about being smart.  You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about.
And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.
I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?
Oh, God!  Oh God!
Just relax.
Me and Wes are just going to talk.
I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in this together, understand?
I don't hear any--
But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.
Where is it?  Where'd it go?
Stay low.
Is it dead?
Why do I have to stay down here?
Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
We'll find our way.
We can't just leave him.
Yeah.
And then shoot them.
Somebody has to.
I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.
This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes.  You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.  And you've been fair too.  I mean, even after I...you know...
Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?
Well, this is it.  We get the car, find some Americans.  We find Americans we'll be all right.
They're all good ones.  Satellites we've got can snap a shot of the boil on Saddam's ass.
Yeah, a headache.  My head hurts.  You're making me uncomfortable.
I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.
At-at-at-at-at.
Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you figure it is?
I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
This is too much.  You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.
We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we get what we came for.
Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
It's got a bottom.
You down?
Stress category.
triple three, triple three! easy.....
You've seen enough.
What did you get?
Then why did you bring it up?
That's not food.  Can't be food.
I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started.  I almost let you go on so many times.  It will be worth it, together.  When I was alone, I knew.
I'll try.
What are you doing here?  Is anything wrong?
What do you think you're doing? You're going to get us arrested.
You don't know.  You don't....
Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
It's all right now, shhhh it's all right.
You always manage to avoid the issue:  What's wrong with our present condition?  We're COMFORTABLE and we have plenty of food...I feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat. Why incite trouble?  You should examine your emotions.  It is senseless...
He's coming back for the rest of us.  He can't make it alone.
I've got it!  Astounding!
What?
I'm leaving.
Right now.
What are you talking about. How do you know?  I need her!  I need her.  She needs me.  I've got to get to her.
This one has eyes.  Why did they leave your eyes? Could you ever....
Yes...
Officer Reilly, vice.
Dispatch, this is Reilly.
Who the heck're you?
What're you talking about?
I.R.A. device. Deadliest class of tickers in existence. Computerized, multiple sensors, booby traps, the works. First showed up in a series of I.R.A. bombings in London couple years ago. One of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers. The Girl, is she Irish?
So what were they doing here?
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
Where you guys at?
How do you know?
Would you?
It's from an IRA.
Lane oil...
Thank you.
Alex-
No... No more killing.
Drop it.
What about the ballistics report?
Pooch, can you move it?
Don't talk.
Got it! Ace Match Company, Flint, Michigan.
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
What's this?
Glass, sorry about Pooch, he was a good man. We don't have time to give you a break right now, we're going ahead and-
Amsterdam?
I don't care <u>what</u> you say! In Constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas--
Like it?
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
Yes, sir?  What shall we start with, Baron?
I would start with cocktails.
You're not safe anywhere nowadays.
Um-hum ...
I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.
It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron--
And you will be out by tomorrow morning.
Otherwise I'll call the police
Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!
Who?
The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded.  Baron, I shouldn't have come!
Don't stop. Keep right on complaining. It's beautiful.
Disappointed?
Yes--Filiba! Venice--Grand Hotel-- room two fifty-three--
Spanish passports?
At twelve twenty. I know.  Lyons two, four, seven, one.  Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!
Don't you <u>realize</u>--
Then you go to the left. There's a landing.
Yes.
Then you go into the foyer.
I remember.
Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
Too much blue in crimson.
Beautiful specimen.
Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
Talk? About me--about us?
And you're going to fall for them.
I know it.
You look beautiful.
You have been robbed--for years. And not a hundred thousand francs, but millions. And you know who did it? Adolph.
I'm sorry, madame, but there are still certain matters which I think you should attend to yourself. And I, personally, would not care to refer them to--to-- 
Madame Colet, I've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years.  I was a school friend of your husband's ...
Well--uh--yes and no.
Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
Well, in times like these most people are cutting salaries, but suppose we say, in your case, three hundred and fifty?
Rush her.
What could possible be funny?
Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the --
Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!
You know somebody?
Captain, the press knows the size of Titanic, let them marvel at her speed too. We must give them something new to print. And the maiden voyage of Titanic must make headlines!
No you won't.
Hello again.
Mr. Dawson, I --
Jack.
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
If only it were that simple.
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!
Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.
I think I would.  And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
Yes sir.
Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heart-like shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond.
It's been 84 years...
Do you want the truth, Anya?
Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
Will you leave me alone?
I can think of nothing nicer. It's very kind of you to invite me--
Sorry I can't return the compliment.
Well, I'm off to a pretty good start.
I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three. 
In that case--you owe us exactly sixteen hundred dollars.
Wait a minute!--They're dancing in the palm court--
This is great. I'll be able to watch your act every night.
You work too fast for me, young man.
A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.
Sally--!
You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.
We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
We coulda got two third-class!
It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
Not a chance.
--there's thousands of 'em!
I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
Thank you, sir. 
Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
Don't get yourself all worked up--
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
She did?
"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."
Next month is June.
O.K.! Send that!
Knots!
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
Those kids seem to be getting along fine!--
It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--
--And he has sex appeal.
Because I want you--will always want you--no other woman'll ever take your place.  I want you more now than I did that first night--  You've forgotten all that, I suppose?
That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire.  How about Ned?
S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
I wouldn't say that--  I'm glad he's dead--yes--I'd thought of killing him-- but I didn't--
Congratulations.
Soon as I get that bracelet back I'm going to relax. Wish the guy that borrowed it would help me out--I got to win that fifty bucks.
Everything in order, sir?  What are <U>you</U> doing here, my lad?
Ain't got time.
I said that's 500 to you, Holliday.  In or out?
Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers-
Yes, very.  And very married.
Not now.  I don't have time.
Come and get him.
He was quoting the bible, Revelations: "Behold a pale horse And the one that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him."
Feel bad about ol' Fred.  Just Can't hold back when I'm feelin' Woolly.  Still, feel kinda bad. But now we're square.  Anyway no Use for holdin' a grudge.  I Deserved a rap in the head.
This brand.
I'm sorry.  If there was any other-
Excuse me?
No Marshal, you don't understand. I'm through with lawing, I'm Through with the whole Proposition.  Forever.  I did my Duty, now I'd like to get on with My life.  That is if you don't Mind.  Jesus.  Good day now.
I see, off to strike it rich, Huh.  All right, fine, wish you Luck.  Tell you this though, never Was a rich man yet didn't wind up With a guilty conscience.
All right, lunger.  Let's do it.
Here, Doc.
That's my lovin' man.  Just can't Get enough.
Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?
Well yeah.  Pretty much.  I mean I Was no angel when we met but People change Doc.  I mean sooner Or later you gotta grow up.
Nonsense, I have not yet begun to Defile myself.
Doc...
I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt.  Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's.  Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life.  There's Only life, that's all.  Just life. The rest is relative.
Not half as bad as I feel.
You're the doctor.  sad news, friend.
What?
There they go.  Look kinda like preachers.
Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That Means lucky.
That was lovely!
I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all.  Am I Happy?  Are you happy?
Well I ought to know my own mind And I'm tellin' you what suits me Is a family and kids.  That suits Me right down to the ground.  In Fact, that's my idea of heaven.  All right, what's your idea of heaven?
Well he's handsome and he's Charming.  He's all right.  For Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest.
Always?
So I assume we're regarding this As just a kind of interlude.
Why don't you get rid of him and Get yourself straight dealer?
Those Cowboys're tellin' Everybody in town they're gonna Clean you out.  They're down in That lot right now behind the OK Corral.
Thought you swore you'd never Carry that thing again.
Mattie.  What about this?
I need it.
Look, Mattie, I know you're-
That what you got me up here for?
'Least they don't scare women.
I ain't your brother, I ain't None of your damn brothers.  Move!
I know that cut.  You mean there's A waterhole near there?
I know, I was wrong.  But Morg, Look, we got to get out.
Easy Morg, don't think about that now.
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
Billy Clanton, Wes Fuller, and Billy Claiborne.  Now there's six Of 'em.  This is like a bad dream.
No, damn it, it's wrong, they're Breakin' the law.
Curly Bill, huh?  Who was that Other idiot?
Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton.  It's deadlier than uranium.
They're merely tools to disseminate information.
In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, Mr. Bond.
4:30. It may take me a little longer to wrap things up here.
What - no lust for adventure?
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
Fishing?
Saunders, I've lit cigarettes -
Moving along -  A typical plastic security card. Name here, magnetic information stripe here -  And a code breaking microprocessor here. Swipe it through any card reader - anywhere - you're in.
- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
Nice to run into you again.
If I were you -
Here. You shoot. I'll drive.
Sorry I'm late -
I have an excellent teacher.  'Make sure you wear the uniform'?
What do you make of all this?
The infrared satellite images. No heat, no flame, no explosion. If that boat went down where they said it did, there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface.
Stop it!
I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.
Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.
Pencil it in for the next trip -
Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution, and explain I have no control over what my journalists write -
Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations
Fueled and waiting.
- Built to withstand a nuclear blast.  Are they alive?
...Haven't we already paid him for his services?
Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.
Who is that?!? What's in the box??
Will it go off?
I pay my own way.
This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
Why in the hell didn't you help mama?
I bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof, you would have rebuilt the whole damn house.
What is a sip of coffee going to do?
Will you still get the money from your father?
It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.
I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.
What for?
Don't pick up the cards if you are not in the game. Did he die?
You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there.
I don't want to wear out welcome, but you can stay in someone's heart longer than you can stay in their house. Come with us, boy. We are going to have a good time.
This would be a bad time for me to leave.
Not anymore, not in the city.
Don't bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are.
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
No, I'm too hot now.
You must have been really sick.
You better come sit down. You are still sick.
He's going to check out heaven first. He gets a round trip ticket to heaven. He gets in heaven and finds it just like back home. People dripping with sweat, working in the fields, hardly surviving. He asked a man who was getting a drink of water, "I thought the streets were paved with gold." "They are but you won't see them," he said. "Boy, you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness." So he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell. He sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back, picking their teeth. "Man, this is a dream." He asked, "What's you'll doing?" They all hollered back, "Sinning." The devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said, "Please to meet you." He asked, "I thought you'll was supposed to be burning in fire." Someone said, "Man, ain't no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins." The man was going go ask the preacher back on earth...
I'm almost finished. I'm about to come to the punch line.
Man, put your boxes down and stay as long as you like. We have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out.
Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.
You remember that boy who lost his mind, Joe? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. He would pick up a brick and say "go on in there brick and hit somebody" and it would find its mark.
I have someone I want you to meet.
Ah, you young folks don't know how it is. How is Gideon today?
Let me get you a cup?
I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
An empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you, tappy head, you ain't worth the salt you put in greens.
Well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance. Don't take me wrong but you can't judge people by how you act. You're a caring person.
You know Okra asked me to marry him the other evening.
He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
Now you don't have to say anything if you don't want to.
Counting the gray hairs in your head.
But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
But Mom, I can't find him!
Next stop...
Woody!  Buzz!
Which one can I open first?
T-O-Y.  Toy.
Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.
THAT is Sid!
Buzz!!  Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble!
Trouble?!  Where?!
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
Oh.  Oh, that's good.
Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
Woody!  The rocket!
This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
B-3.
Sid, give her back!  Give her back now!  I'm telling!
Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody.
Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?
Will you quit moving around?!
Laser-envy.
Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh, heh...
Wait just a minute.  What are you trying to pull?!
Toss 'im overboard!
What the heck is up there?
Sargent.  Establish a recon post downstairs.  Code red.  You know what to do.
Somebody's poisoned the water hole...
Bad news?!
Woody, what are you doing under the bed?
I can't hold on much longer!
I can manage.
I did like the music.
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
Finn ...
Victoria -
No, of course not.  She's one of the top students at her school.
What is he planning on telling them?
I understand.  You're upset.  You want to know what's going on.  That's good.
What is he being charged with?
Have you gone crazy?  You are not Carl.  You aren't as good as Carl.  They are moving the trial to a high security location.  The press has gone berserk.  The jury will be influenced.  Stay out of things. Let us try to win the case.
Why?
To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.
How well do you know this boy, Seth, who was driving?  You know the police have charged him with a DUI and possession of marijuana.
Hi.
How's David?
Live with your parents?
What's that mean?
You do?  What else you do?
Inhale the smoke and hold it.
Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
Have you done your homework, honey?
No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?
Chill out --
They're whispering.  I can't hear them, but I know it.  I smell conspiracy.  I feel the lie vibrating out of the home.
She knows Arnie Metzger.
Are you getting this on tape?
What would a law firm want from the new drug Czar?
David --
I'm on a special phone, may I speak freely?
You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
It's a death sentence.  I'll never make it to the trial.
So you pay off our customs officials?
This is ridiculous.  Why is there no elevator?
Can't you for a second imagine none of this had happened?  That my drugs had gone through.  What would have been the harm?  A few people get high who are getting high anyway. Your partner is still alive.  We avoid having breakfast together. Don't you see this means nothing? That your whole life is pointless?
Every part, from his ears to his accessory belt, is high-impact, pressure-molded cocaine.  Odorless. Undetectable by dogs.  Undetectable by anyone.
You first.
She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.
This is fucking crazy.  Instead of killing us, he sends us on a suicide mission.  Do you know who Frankie Flowers is?  He's a psycho-cokehead- hitman.  A faggot.  He's killed fucking who knows how many people. You'd need half the force to get close to him.  And you can't get their help because he lives in fucking San Diego.
It's important that we work together. Mexico.  America.  One hand washing the other.
Javier Rodriguez.
You watch and learn.  I earn his trust.  Then more pain.  Then I appear with kindness.  Within a week he will follow me around like a dog.
It's possible.
Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?
Oh, man --
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
Yes, I hope so as well.
I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side?
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.
And remember, Rents: no skag.
It's a scandal, Franco.
We'll be half-way down the road with the money.
Do you find that this approach usually works, or, let me guess, you've never tried it before. In fact, you don't normally approach girls, am I right? The truth is that you're a quite, sensitive type but if I'm prepared to take a chance I might just get to know the inner you: witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal, a little bit crazy, a little bit bad, but, hey, don't us girls just love that?
Out.
Calm down. You're not going to jail.
Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?
Actually it's a nightmare. I've been desperate for a shag, but watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should try it with Tommy.
No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.
Do you recall the school motto?
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
No, actually I went to Craignewton but I was worried that you wouldn't have heard of it so I put the Royal Edinburgh College instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in this together, and I wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details, yeah? People get all hung up on details, but what's the point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When? Where? Or how many O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one, but that's not important. What's important is that I am, right? That I am.
Are you getting out much?
No.
I'm sorry, Tommy.
No, I'm clean.
Thanks, Mark.
And you might get the fucking job.
Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for example, had it and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed -
Say something, Mark, say something --
What?
You know.
No, he didn't make me touch it.
Oh no, don't even mention it.
It was my fucking television.
No, I don't think so.
It's fresh air.
How long is it?
That's fair enough.
Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?
He has his doubts...
Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!
The ship....
I couldn't help but notice you pain.
With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
What do you mean?
Yes, Captain?
Be one with the horse.
If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...
There's got to be a way out of this place.
This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.
I believe I have found a faster way.
The emergency channel, open.
...mark two.
No special conditions?
What makes you think I won't turn us around?

Borgus Frat.
I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.
And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
No. I will not.
I hide no pain.
I belong here.
I don't understand...
Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in there...
Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?
I want to go to his place.
You call that getting over it?
For what?
Hello, Alan.
This honey doesn't handle so good in town...
No problem, Master-C. If you've seen one Consumer Electronics Show...  What's up?
I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.
Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
Dumont!
Well, isn't it -- ?
Greetings, program...
Flynn...  Where's Ram?
Not us, I hope.
How about you?
Boy the view from up here... you know the territory?
Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
He was disoriented in transport, Tron.
Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. Which branch of the service?
Why is everything...like this?
Yes...it can take us across the Sea of Simulation... all the way out of the Game Grid...to the MCP.
Nice...
Out.  If Dad doesn't care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should I care? I'm going to a movie.
No you're not.  You're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake!
That's not true, honey--
Yeah, Dad.
You know you can always talk to me.  Right?  Whatever is going on in your life, your mom and I'll understand.
You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?
Immediate roll.  Acquire subject at K Street and Key Bridge.					* Vehicle is red-and-white						* convertible.  You have six minutes.
Harry?  HARRY?!
What's this for?
Uh huh.  And her little hormones are going like a fire alarm.  I				* say even money that physicist on				* the bike is boinkin' her.						*
Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two four.
There's another guy, still in the car.
So, you wanna play huh?  You little--
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.
--you tell the son of bitch this is  Bright Boy Alert.  Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert.  And I need a patch of the White House ASAP. That's right--
Look, if you ask me everything twice, this is going to take a really long time.  And I have to get home to my family.
Call me, if you'd like to see some of my other pieces.
I've always been a collector at heart.  When I see something I want, I have to have it.
Did you tell her about us, Harry?
How long have you been a member of his faction?
Not because you were attracted to him?
I don't know.  I guess I needed something...
This Simon.  Did you sleep with him?
Let me out of her!  Right now!
Oh, gee thanks.  Mmmm, let me see--
I'm sorry, honey.
Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
It makes you tell the truth?
Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
Yeeaoowww!!
You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?
Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine.
Hello?
Worse than Cairo?							*
I'm sorry, I can't.
I know.  But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.
Helen.
What do you want me to do?
The forager's back.
No time. Gotta go. Just tell him to read the letter, the letter explains all. Tell him I love him. And tell him, as of tomorrow, all his money problems are over.
Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?
Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
Sonny kicks ass.
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.
Would you like to get some pie?
What's your favorite color?
I don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black.
Burt Reynolds.
Wow. What a swell place to work.
I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
I love Janis.
You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.
It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself."
A real live pimp?
Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.
No no no no no no no no no...
Where you goin', honey?
What?
Why?
You don't know him -
Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, "If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it." I could. So I did.
You did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do my part OK?
I used to live by one back in Dearborn. It's real frustratin' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. I hated where I was, but I couldn't do anythin' about it. I didn't have enough money. It was tough enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here I was livin' next to an airport. Whenever I went outside, I saw fuckin' planes take off drownin' out my show. All day long I'm seein', hearin' people doin' what I wanted to do most, but couldn't.
But knowin' me and you gonna be nigger-rich gives me a whole new outlook. I love airports now. Me 'n' you can get on any one of those planes out there, and go anywhere we ant.
Go on pussy-eaters... laugh. You look like you be eatin' pussy. You got pussy-eatin' mugs. Now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he's got to do a bunch of fucked-up shit.
So you do eat pussy!
You wanna get unhaunted?
I don't blame you.
All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.
You goin' out?
This shit can't be real.
Elliot Blitzer.
Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit.
In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say?
Now's a helluva time to play "what if".
I'd fuck Elvis.
What are we gonna see?
So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're unloading -
What department?
Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.
Have you read the story on Elvis?
No. Not yet.
It tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the whole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew up with him, the artists he inspired - Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and the fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but they give me the creeps.
I don't know, Clarence, "Doctor Zhivago" is a pretty big movie.
Well, I have to admit, walkin' through the door and seein' these "Soldier of Fortune" poster boys made me a bit nervous. But, Lee, I'm fairly confident that you came here to do business, not to be a wise-guy. So, if you want, I'll put the gun on the table.
Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.
If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?
Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what?
Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
Nope.
Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.
On their honeymoon.
If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?
Could we try it now?
Sure was.
But a fuckin' baggie.
You're no longer an extra -
Don't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself.
Just put it in your purse.
Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.
Put it in your pants.
Sorta room-mates?
No.
I didn't mean -
What was the Jew-boy's name?
It's important to observe everything.
They forced me to take drugs.
San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
You don't have a driver's license, James?  Or a Social Security card?
I have to go.
Do you know what year it is?
I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me?
Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child?  Something so bad...?
About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.
What will you do...when you find this...secret army?
Look, I'm warning you.  You do anything, I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!
All I see are dead people.  Everywhere. What's three more?
Shot!  Who shot you?
What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?
See -- you can drive after all!
I need help all right.  They're coming after me.
James!  That's a policeman.  Pretend you don't know me.  If he sees you...
Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what?
I thought I was in...prison again.
I want to be here.  In this time.  With you.  I want to become...become a whole person.  I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.
Right!  You're right.  I have to fix this.
Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right?  That's very sane.  I can help you.  You want me to, don't you?  Get you out?
What's that mean?
Never saw him before in my life.  Go ahead and shoot him or torture him or whatever it is you do.
The phone call, man.  The phone call.
It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
I said it was bad judgment!  What else do you want me to say?
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
Ex-psychiatrist!  Now, what about flashlights?  How many flashlights...?
WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON WALLS?  You think I told her about the Army of the 12 Monkeys?  Impossible!  Know why, you pathetically ineffectual and pusillanimous "pretend-friend-to- animals"?!  I'll tell you why:  because when I had anything to do with her six years ago, there was no such thing -- I hadn't even thought of it yet!
Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...
What?  What did you say?
I said I was sorry.
Oh, Jesus.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
Or maybe you just think you do.  You can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
Nothing.
Never heard of it.  It's got no day or date.  Hell, it ain't even got numbers.  What's the matter?  You couldn't afford a Timex?
Out of here.
We have a bus to Mexico.  Arrives in two hours.  Have to make a couple of connections, but it will get you across the border.
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
That'll make five in a row.  Never seen it so hot.  Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed.  I'd rather just lay there and try to catch a breeze.  I was in Mexico this one time--
Somewhere else?  Mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here.  How you planning on getting it there? You gonna push this heap yourself?
Time.
Twenty-after-ten.
Nothing.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
Look, I just want to pick up my car.
How much?
Hundred-fifty.
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred- fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket. That's going to run you another fifty.
Take it.  As soon as I get my money. Fifty dollars for an almost new gasket.  You don't know what kind of a deal you're getting.
Open up!
We ain't got no Beck's.
No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.
Genuine Draft?
That yours, Mrs. McKenna?
That wasn't so bad.  What's thirty- some-thousand to rich folks like you?  It didn't hurt a bit.
What the hell you looking at, girl?
No, I've got it.
'Course they cost a little more than I should really be spending.  But, damn it, I don't hardly ever do anything nice for myself.  I deserve nice things.
Thank you, John.
Where you coming from?
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
Beautiful?
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.  I mean, I would . . . do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:  You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
Yeah, a bird in a gilded cage.
If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .
I wanted to talk.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
Let's go in the bedroom.
Get it, and put the money in it. Pack up anything else you want to take with you.
It doesn't matter.  He was there and he let it happen.  He can't take us in.
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
John, throw me the keys.
You closed it, didn't you, Grace?
And you're not one to lie, are you?
Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?
Who the hell are you?
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
I guess we've never been introduced proper.  Jake McKenna.
Where you headed?
Live there?
I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house with that smile of hers.  Bet she wiggled her ass in your face more than once.  Then me busting in like some wild bear.  Bet you had a fire going under you.
I was hoping we could talk.
About things.  About your wife.
I do.
Just to get out of here?  That doesn't seem much for a murder.
Twenty-thousand?  I don't have that kind of money.  I won't get the insurance until months after she's dead.  I don't imagine you'll want to be around after poor Grace's demise.  Twenty-thousand; that's more money than I could ever get my hands on.
I guess I might as well get this done with.
The time wasn't right.
You're out in the desert, the middle of nowhere with no one around for miles, and you say the time wasn't right?  What's the matter?  You were hoping to get it on home video?  A keepsake for the grandkids.  Thank God I waited, or I never would have gotten it on tape.
You know what I mean.
Shut up.
You could say.  I don't even have it yet.
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me--
You thought you'd come in here in the middle of the night and wham! Wail off and clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper.
That's a thick change of heart.
Sense?  If I had any sense I would have killed you this morning and been done with it.
You're right.  I don't give a damn about her.  But to fuck a man's wife behind his back?  That just makes a fool out of him.  I don't like being made a fool of.
Toby Tyler, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
Christ, I don't believe this.
Give it to me!
That's a shame, John.  A real shame.
You don't know the how, Mr. Vesci. And that's not the half of it.  I've got your money, and I go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.
Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush.
Now step around to the back of the car and open the trunk for me.
What'd you think, boy?  That you were the first man to drift through this town she came on to?  Not by a long shot.  You're just the most gullible.  How much did you get?
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
Hell no!
What do you want for free?
What?
I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.
So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
Now, what's this?
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.
How do you know if you've never tried?
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband gettin' pissed off.  I don't want anybody dead.
You love her, but you hate her?
Next time you'll do just fine.
You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at?
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter for the juke?
Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
Darrell--
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
What?
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
Open up!
That's none of your business.  Get the keys.
No.
I call the sheriff.
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
It's Grace.
Where you coming from?
What happens when you lose?
Where'd you learn to do that?
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?
How do you know he's still not here?
Yeah, I guess you're right.
You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
What about us?
I thought you couldn't get your car.
I could if I had Jake's money.
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
I don't know about that?
You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.
I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.
Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.
Bobby? Are you all right?
I busted my leg!
There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit.  Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.
A hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.
Out of here.
How much?
Beck's.
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
I don't want the fuckin' money! I'm not gonna give up everything I got for a lousy 50,000 dollars. It's <u>you</u>. You <u>Grace</u> or nothing. The whole thing... I want you to be my wife.... What do you way Grace?
Who was that on the phone?
What's the matter?
Help me, Grace, help...
I axed you a question.
Is Noel in?
How old is Jeb?
I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.
Oh shit...
...When you work with clients on machines, do they sometimes just jump up a level or two? Do something they didn't know they were capable of?
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
Rust?
My turn. What's your favorite song?
Soft and Wet. That's very interesting.
Why?
Not money.  But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.
Are you for real?
Like what?
I have to go now.
He's doing well today.
I want to sleep here tonight.
I'm going to go in.
Just one--
How much did you take off?
What do you do if something happens?
I see.
That's great.
You like sports?
What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.
We're going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this.  It works the quadriceps.
I'm not going out anymore. I'm not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you.
Well, go get it then.
A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done?
We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
I didn't think they'd really do it.
Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
Little Bill come out of Kansas an' Texas, boys. He worked them tough towns.
They went out scouting when they saw your fever broke.
You're a beautiful woman an'... if I was to want a free one, I guess I'd want you more than them others. It ain't... See... I can't have no free one on account of my wife...
I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.
We got one of them fuckers, Sheriff, out by Cow Creek, we...
Alive?
This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.
An' all them cowboys been riding that beef down to Kansas an' Cheyenne?
I could run off them whores.
Well, Mister Hendershot, if I was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if I was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, I guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that so?
Meaning the duck himself, I guess.
Uh... Sheriff... Uh...
Huh? Oh.  Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.
Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...
They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.
He said how you was really Three Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an' Bill said "Same Three Fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?" An' Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73.
I don't never see nobody anyhow.
What the hell are you pissin' about, I'd like to know?
Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?
Tell me right off if you see him.
You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?
Yeah?
It's a hell of a thing, ain't it, killin' a man. You take everythin' he's got... an' everythin' he's ever gonna have...
Lemmee see it.
This here money, take my share an' Ned's an' leave it with my youngsters. Tell 'em half goes to Sally Two Trees if I ain't back in a week. The rest is yours... you could buy them spectacles.
I... I... think I'm... shot.
Wh-wh-who did you kill first?
Eleven.
Sally?
I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her.  She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more.
I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters.  Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up.
Some fucker's shootin' at us.
He hit you?
I seen the angel of death Ned, an' I seen the river.  He's a snake, he got... snake eyes.
What is it, son?
I guess you lost some hogs to the fever.
He say anythin'... The Kid... ?
Did I what?
K-k-kill somebody?
I guess you didn't kill nobody then.
Well, you was shootin' every which way an'...
I don't kill nobody without him. 
Depends what he told you.  About Bill, you mean?
They just said they wanted time.
I know you. You don't think I know you're on the take. This whole fucking precinct is dirty. You don't have a fucking leg to stand on.
What are we gonna do?
You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
I did you a favor by standing up for you last night, but don't think we're friends. I'm sorry, but I have other things -
What fence? Who?
Keaton, I can't just -
We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.
Mr. So- My employer has made up his mind. He does not change it.
I'11 find him.
That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know.
There's nothing in there about Ruby.
The first thing I learned on the job, know what it was? How to spot a murderer. Let's say you arrest three guys for the same killing. Put them all in jail overnight. The next morning, whoever is sleeping is your man. If you're guilty, you know you're caught, you get some rest - let your guard down, you follow?
Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman? Bullshit. He was using her.
Let me tell you something. I know Dean Keaton. I've been investigating him for three years. The guy I know is a cold-                    + blooded bastard. L.A.P.D. indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force, so don't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold.                        +
The D.A. gave me immunity.
Do you believe in him, Verbal?
So why play into his hands? We can protect you.
That was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois.
You're stalling, Verbal.
Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling. You know what I'm getting at.
I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
Keaton was Keyser Soze
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
How good's your intelligence?
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin... ...nothing can make the woman well...but we try to compensate...to make a gesture...
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount.  Two Hundred Ten Thousand.  That would mean I keep seventy.
...We did everything we could...
...of Anesthesiology?
How old are you?
Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
Nothing further, your Honor.
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
Yes.
You ruined my life, Mister...Me and my wife...and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl.  We been going four years.    Four years...my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
'Code Blue'...
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
That's what I'd planned to...
Yes.  Yes.  I think so.  I hope you'll be comfortable.  I'm putting you up at my...
...I made a reservation at...
...apartment.   No, no. Please.  You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
No, you did fine.
I.  Yes.  It is.
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle ... her estate ...
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
Yessir.  I'm sorry.
Why is that?
Thank you for seeing me.
I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out...They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case.  Now this is it today.
I object, your Honor...
I have to reach him.  This is an emergency.  Could you give me his home number?
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
Yes.  Price...
Still looking.
Do you want me to go...?
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed.  It's all right. I'll stay here with you.  It's all right.  Come on...
That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.
Who told you that?
You, you don't under...
Uh ...
... now who is that ...?
One lousy letter eighteen months ago. . . .I try to throw a fuckin' case your way ...
They killed her.  And they're trying to buy it...
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine.  Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.'  Can you get out tomorrow?  How come she isn't speaking up.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
You use their witness.
...one of the other nurses?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, the roving nurse...
But those notations stop...  ...four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.   Jimmy, gimme another drink.    How are you?
He won't talk.
How long have you been back?
Almost a year.
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?
No.
More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.
Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
Why?
Then will you for me?
Dinner... and what else?
Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
I'll take care of you.
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
Your accident...
I don't know... Switzerland?
...Old Port Point!  Out at the Presidio! Of course I remember! I often go there!
Where had you been before?
-- talking to you...
Good-bye.
Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
When you jumped in the bay, you didn't know where you were. You guessed but you didn't know.
What do you remember?
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
No, never!
Here with you.
Let me go.
To the church, I must go there.
Let me go! Let me go!!
Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?
Does she sleep here? Ever?
Her car is gone.
No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
How do you know? Personal experience?
Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it.
Johnny!
I'm not telling you what I think! I'm telling you what he thinks!
What was this desperate urge to see me?
I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.
Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the Sad Carlotta...
The stripper's here.
You're interrupting a personal conversation.
I was just playing...we were playing just playing around.
The floor was wet. She slipped!
I don't know why the floor was wet!
The hell I don't.
Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
Go home!
One idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars.
We have to call the ambulance.
We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
We can do this. We can get her out of here.
Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?
Have you ever done this before?
We can't do this.
Who? What are you talking about?
Adam! Calm down.
What?
No. No. No. It's what my father said to me. He said it and he meant it... He said to me...He said, Adam, he said...He told me and I heard him... he said...  Hell he said so many Goddamn things I can't remember everything he said for Christsake.
Are you solid with that?
I know...
I want you to hear me out.
What are you talking about?
You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
He's right.
We need padded chairs.
She's all your's Fish. Anything you want. Happy bachelor party.
What kind of words?
He is not cracking up.
Boyd...What have we done?
What is the question you asked me?
I don't think that's such a good idea.
Take care of business.
Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation.
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!
Whatever you say Kojak.
Not true.
Sent it.
Why?
I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here.
I just don't see him in the big picture.
He's weird.
You expect more what?
You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on "Oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.
Time out.
I've seen it on television.
Keith do not trivialize this.
I need your help.
More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.
Well you should.
Yeah. Nesting.
Hey. It's me.
What about the chairs?
Okay.
What!
Are they fighting?
We're not canceling.
No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back.
Don't even.
What?
What kind of stupid question is that?
The prostitute.
But...
I love you dad.
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
You're not breathing right?
I'll take a ride.
I'm getting married...
I think so.
I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter.
I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.
We don't say "love, honor and obey" anymore. And we don't say "till death do us part." Today we say, "respect, honor and cherish, as long as you both do love." How does that sound?
The stone age.
Take your time. I wish I had.
That's our plan.
I don't think that's a good idea.
I'll come to you tonight.
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
I'm well ... The bus was late, wasn't it? ... What was the journey like?
If you only knew ... When I was young I was full of idealism. I wanted to do something on a big scale for others, something to show my great love for humanity. But as soon as I tried to do something about it, I became afraid that I would be laughed at and I felt like a fool ... and so I went back into my shell.
You're lying.
Why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days?
The way she looked at me, Ramona! She hates me now. I think I've made a great mistake. She's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her.
What will the lady say?
It won't take but a minute. It's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever. Our Lady of the Helpless granted her a favor.
It's very good.
I don't know, sir.
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
There's no point in helping some of them when there are so many others.
You cannot leave ...
Very, very?
How do you feel?
From the terrace.
This is the newest technology approved for general implementation. It's called a locater implant. Every parolee gets one.  We're going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life.
What are they doing in Los Feliz?
You were supposed to act as if everything was real.
Any sign of Lindenmeyer?
Why didn't anybody tell me?!
Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach.
You know how much man power you're talking about?
Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
I told you this would work.. By setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality. He still thinks he's in the real world.
Should I have?
It was me, what?
How can I ever thank—you for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl?
That's not true, Parker.
I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him.  Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done.  The question is, what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7?
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.
Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
I forgot what real coffee tastes like...
Relax. I know what you meant.
What the hell's going on?!
Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it?
This isn't a game, Parker!
If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't be far behind.
...I think so...You?
More or less.
Lindenmeyer?
Where's John?
The only thing I want to hear is your silence.
To the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes.
Well, darlin' <u>I</u> ain't your confessor.  Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing.  Okay;  <u>Now</u>:  Folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that.  But in Six Days, Lord willing n'Jesus Tarries, I am going to take you beauties into the second term. .....wait til you hear the speech tonight.

He, uh, has he been in the "jail" long?

Twenty thousand dollars.

What did Albania ever do to us?
It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
Waal, that's where you <u>want</u> em...

We're locked into Albania.
Hello...?
Heavy weather East of here.
Who're you working for?
S'all very well, but when the Fit hits the Shan, somebody's going to have to Stay After School, and who do you 'spose that might be.
S'only got to hold for another few days.
Why do they go to War?
What do you think would hold it off?
Uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u>, uh...  You're kidding.
That's from the ... it's got to be from the...
Is that true?
It's Miss America, N'you're Bert Parks. 
They got to have something that we want.
...who is this guy...?
You can't have a war without an enemy.
Where is he now?
What?
Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. 
Whattaya gonna do when this is all over?
Of what?
...the Albanian Campaign.  And we won't even be a footnote...
What the hell do <u>we</u> care?
Wake up.
Get on your feet, boy.
I'm tired.
He's supposed to be flying in from Europe.
What he went through in <u>Albania</u>...
Hell of a show.  Hell of a job, Stan.

Jim Belushi...?
By the  media, by, yes, by, in this case, our organization.
With their berets...
I need a ruling on the Hats.  I say a Leopard-skin, and...
That's right, we'll take a nap.  We'll get you to Washington, we'll get you Back to your Buddies, and...
...'bout ready to Mix it Up...?
Yup.
Oh, hell...
If I'm closing out this account. If he doesn't pay for it tomorrow, you pay for it.
...you take that Anacott Steel?
Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got it all upside down.  Okay, I'm giving this to you and you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for you. Take the Knicks against the Bullets, and my pick of the day -- Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest.
...well, see him?
All right, I owe you one Marv.
Hey you hear the news. I just got a job at a new firm: "Dewey, Cheat 'em and Howe." Yuk yuk.
Speak English will ya.
So come home and live rent free, 'stead of that cockroach palace you live in. $50,000 Jesus Christ, the world is off its rocker. I made $37,000 last year and you...
... it adds up Buddy, 300 here, 200 there. Your brother never...  ...well, I always said money is something you need in case you don't die tomorrow...
You sure about this FAA announcement?
What if they call him?
Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal?
...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...

I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...
...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious.
What? How do you know about my father?
Know the name?
Revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport.  ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world...  Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me half the picture, then he got fired...
I got all I could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50 calls. Average price of $47 a share And $4 per contract for the call. I just wish I could've got more.
I'll be right there, fix them a drink.
Sorry, Mr. Gekko.
"All warfare is based on deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate.
You don't understand. I want to be surprised...astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien. Here's some inside info for you. That Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. So don't lose your place in line.  Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this. The lights coming up over the water. I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment.  ...an old Russian proverb - "a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar." I like you sport, I ever tell you that... Gordon, call me Gordon from now on.
Gordon what I want--and I never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this. I want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune!
Now, wait a minute, Dad...
Where is it?
The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
Well, why stop at that?
You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded...
Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...
Are you mad! Why are you doing this! We're so close, the town is going to be ours. Don't throw away your future Bud!
You may not believe this Bud but I really do care for you. I think we could've made a good team...but that's how it goes...
Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours.
You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things.
What do you say we go get a suite at the Carlyle? Caviar? Champagne? Celebrate, just like the old times Sunshine.
Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?... No, not interested.  Ollie, start calling a the institutions, start with Marx at Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me that California retirement money, baby! And we're on our way!
Yeah, yeah, OK
What's that?
Well if you're in such a rush darling, why don't you lead the way?
Your books Master Loftmore
Thank you Jenkins
And uh, your nicotine sir
They seemed, closing by much 
That's not what you said last night.
You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.
Anyone else not coming?
Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.  They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.
Well?
Well divide 18 into three
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
Stop saying things so loud!
Looks a little spooky boys, you think we should do this?
That was very good.
Besides, Dad would have freaked.
That's not true.
What?
I didn't want to come.
Fireball?
What's happening to me?
You think you influenced her?
Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by someone.  This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my--
There was just...some tension.  You were upset.  I remember being concerned.
At the party.
Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
Who?  Your husband?
How?  How can you help me?  With your flowers and your perfect life...
What?
Um...sure.
I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
Y'hear anything you'll let me know?
She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.
Telling you...
Sit down here.
I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.
Then what was it?
And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours.
Okay.  Okay.
I'm a terrible friend.
She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
But he acted like he'd never heard of it.
I think three...
To tell you the truth...I'm excited.
It's just us now.
Wanna fool around?
Maybe we should just...
Remember how we were?
Claire?
It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.
Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly.
He killed her.
See?
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--
Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under some strain.  But there's no such thing as ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed?
Dressed?
...like it never even happened...
This is the Feur thing?
You know what I've got at stake with this paper.  You know that.  I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow.
The accident...?
You dropped a glass.
I...
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
We don't know that for sure.
She's gone.
She can't be here without me.
Do you know it?
You don't have to do that.
Many times over the past thirty years. Why he shows himself to me, I don't know but Lasher's not some mindless wraith.
How do you know about Rowan ...?  I didn't --- Cemetery...?
I ask only that you stay here, long enough to be - educated.  A few hours.
Michael, Rowan should -
What have the witches always asked of you...?
I'll probably be back in a week...but I can't spend Christmas in that house.   you'll check on her - every day...?
What are you talk---
Rowan...
Always give the crovd a taste, darling.  Now - Ryan said I'm supposed to make sure -
Who the hel1 -
What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!
She didn't feel them
Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!
Massive subdural hamatoma.  We have to evacuat it - right now.
Lie...?
YOU VIOLATED ME!!!  ON MY WEDDING NIGHT!
Explain this to me --- violated...?
You went into the cells --- and you changed them.  How...?!
ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
Do they keep everything 'out' ...?
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
you're very --- different.
You look very deep when you do that.  It's interesting.  We're Complete opposites-  I'd never just sit and wait for insparation.  I'd skip my turn and swap some letters.
Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know -
Let's see...  Next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we're doomed to fail - right...?   you hate kittens and puppies, you've drivin all your lovers to suicide --and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really -
Michael - I have to go - to New Orleans. I'll - I'll call yati when I -
Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last night!
You're just afraid I'll drop dead before I finish the damn house.
ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.
Michael - I'm sorry...  Just give me -
Sut McKinley.  Marry me.
I'm sorry - I didn't think
Yes, I'm sure you could - but I can't risk you loosing your job
Do you take sugar?
I'm sorry?
Sugar?
And how many people have you killed?
my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?
The press think that the WHITE ANGEL is a woman - why is that? Do you dress up LESLIE?
Tell me about your wife...
Tell me how it happened...
I want it to stop - it all to stop...
I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
What's wrong?
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
ELLEN, would you like a cup - there's plenty in the pot
I'm sorry, I couldn't - when is she due?
What's wrong with you?
At home alone - where were you?
I'm really very sorry - I was banking on this coming through, because it's only five minutes from my surgery...
That's good
Good - I've got to dash -  Say that I said hello to ELLEN for me would you...
Sugar?
Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism.
Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation.
Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
Hurry.
I get it now. You and me. We're dead.
It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.
I feel like I'm entering a forbidden tomb...
No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.
And while you're at it, I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads.
We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?
I guess.
Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
What do you want me to do?
Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.
So, what brings you here at his hour?
Very funny.
Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.
Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?
But you triple-dog-dared me.
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
I'm trying to help.
Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
I guess.
Don't write that part.
My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.
It's incredibly simple.
You're amazing.
You're quick. I like that.
You don't have to work another day in your lives.
Oh. Goodness.
I need your help.  I'm really in deep shit.
I do?
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
It's not like I didn't have ideas, I had plenty of ideas. But I never even shared them with your father. Never had the guts.
Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."
You think we should be more open minded?
I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.
Such enthusiasm. Have I told you lately how proud I am of you?
Thanks for teaching me an important lesson. What makes a family is love, not blood.
In a hurry, are we?
I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.
What about the blood?
What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...
I understand.
Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you?
Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean that's how it sounded in my head.  He hurt me...
Did you try to fight him?
Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.
Same as him.  They saw her come.  They saw her go.  They saw him follow.
You're telling me you believe the guy?
That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.
Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial.  Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right?  So why not tell us about the affair?  I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.
Eliminate the competition.
Where's the body?
Yes.
Why?
You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls...
Kelly's next, Gloria.
I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded, like she understood.  We stood up together.
Yeah... okay... he did
He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.
He was my friend at first.  Then I got busted... he didn't even stick up for me.  I had to go away to that hellhole. It's like, you're his favorite, then who cares?  You wanna know something?  When Kelly said we should do this, I thought cool, all these big shots screwing me over, like that cop, Duquette.  Now they're gonna get screwed.
Excuse me?
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
You know what it takes.
I'm running away.
You think that's wise?
There's nothing for them to get.
Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.
It's Celine.  He's okay.  He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are.
Davy.
Yes.
Fuck you.  This is bullshit.  I'm outta here.
What?  You're going to drive off without even saying hi?
Look.  I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter.  So what?
Jim West.
Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.
Prepare what?
All that jumping and kicking.
No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
Thank you.
Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
Well, sir, you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests.
You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.
Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.
This is Colonel Richards.
Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
I've even printed my own currency.
Easy now.
Who were they?  What do they want with me?
Are you all right?
Now it's a bomb.
Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!
You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?
You're chasing a dream.
You mean, you know who this baby belongs to?
No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life.
I do what I'm told.
Here are her diaper rags.  And this is her milk bladder.  And when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder.  She likes that.
Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told me.
I'll help you...!
She said lots of thing.s
She asked about you, Madmartigan.
Willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if Raziel's wrong?
Watch it!
I have an idea.  Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs.
It's not a Nelwyn baby.
What do I need for that?
We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!
This is not going well.
Where's Timmy and Buck?
Put my car in the garage and close the door.
Don't let them hurt you.
Oh, he's good.
Amish.
What have you got?
Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight – street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
So one of them got to him.
Maybe.
Now what's the problem?
They kid a lot.
Oh? Anything else?
But John... why didn't you go to a hospital?
Tell him his tea stinks.
But Stoltzfus said...
Oh?  What happened to Hochstetler?
Whacking is not of much use on a farm.
But... You may not be well enough.
It's me.
Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
You hear me?
I admit I don't know where he is.
You're the first one he'll contact.
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him –
John said you're Amish.
Good morning.
No...
No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look...  Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!
I am not a child.
He'll live.
Seventy --  Dorothy, please!
Oh, come on - come on! We'll soon find the Wizard!
Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
This?
Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur!  I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West.  The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
Are you ready now?
How did you guess?
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
Yes --
Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
No, they won't - honestly.
...paper?
...bed.
Oh -- 
Oh - I'll get it!
Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.
Oh.
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.
Oh, now I'll never get home!
...don't talk.
Ohhhh --
Um-hmm.
Where's Kansas?
That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
Um-hmm.
Hooray!  I guess that did it!  Help yourself.
Oil can what?
...along.
What happened?
Oh, you did it yourself!
Fine.  He's got a plan
Up!
It's a whatzis.
Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.
Howdy, Miss Gulch.
...Tin Man!
No, sir!
I don't think I could, but we could try.
Let's.
Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!
Oh, don't worry about me. I'm all right. We must worry about Dorothy.
...to Dorothy!
What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, I’ve heard them all.
Who’s she?
Do you know what you’re doing?
I love Christmas in Turkey.
It’s barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond, but you understand, a man in my position..
Revenge isn’t so hard to fathom. What’s clever is getting someone else to pay for it.
Yes.
Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
No!  It will cave in!
If this little show is for my benefit, I’ll take you home right now.
You can drop the act, it’s over.
Valentin Zukovsky.
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division.
How high up does this...arms dealing go?
What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?
I thought you were the one in her business.
No!  Get me out!
What?
He was a...good lover?
The parcel’s in the post.
Washington?
That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --
Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?  Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
You're the only human being I care for.
I won't do that.
Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.  Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.
Don¹t be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We won¹t even be here, will we?
I¹m not.
What if you¹re wrong??
Damn straight!  We were heroes.
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
The Owlship.  I can't believe it.
No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.
What's he doing?
Welcome back, Night Owl.
He saved himself.  He changed the past.
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.
Their real names, please.
He's a little farther gone every time.
Maybe I'll do that.
Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --
Ever see one of these before?
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.
We're not after car thieves here.
Yes it does.
Come on, Gibbons, you can do better then that.
Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.
Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
Like what?
You do everything Yorgi says?
Come on, don't front like that. You'll put a guy right off you.
Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are.
The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.
Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much.
All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.
It's a long story, but yeah, more or less.
No, I guess I've been no help at all to you.
Where are we going?
We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.
Aren't you afraid?
Did you do your homework?
If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.
Where'd the damn truck go?!
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
I stole your beat, huh? Guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people.
French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?
I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
Nice hops.
I don't believe it! You can't shoot a cop in the middle of the street!
"...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.
How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
Including rape, pillage, murder.
Can the Professor repair his own mind?
Are you all right?
Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.
What's that?
I've served with men like you before. Methodical.  Systematic -- Naive.  You know what happens to those men in a real fight?
Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?
I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  Perhaps even your children, Senator.

You designed this yourself?
I felt like she almost killed me.
Is that what you're looking for?
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
Love me oodles and oodles?
You have your tickets?
Call me from New York before you leave??
Will you miss me?
Very....very!
Oh, nice.
Surprised?
You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
A week.  Ten days at most.
Not at all -- a great privilege, Doctor.
Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
That's 'Fronkonsteen.'
Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary means, it actually began to move with voluntary motion?
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
Are these your bags?
Down!  Get down, you beasts!
Just putting up some tea.
Did you hear that strange music??
Could be worse!
Can you imagine that brain in this body?
Oh!  May I call you 'Master'?
Yes!  When I give the word -- throw the first switch!
Don't try to cheer me up that way.
Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
Yes.
No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?
MMMMMmmmmmmm.
Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmm.
What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?
Look, Doctor!
'As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved to make the Creature of a gigantic stature.' Of course!  That would simplify everything.
Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a...
Reputation.  Reputation!
It looks that way.
I'd be so nervous.
This is not the finals -- just sing!
Give him the sedative!
I think so.
Good night, Doctor.
Yes...yes, you have yours.
It wouldn't be fair to her.
His schwanzstucker.

Will you hear "Last Post", Sir?
Will we be fighting the Zulus soo~, Quartermaster? .
Could be.  Across the river into Zululand. . They might just be waiting there for us to show up... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies!....
If I've got it right, My Lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand, for I see it all around me, but "why?" is the question my readers will ask. "why?"
I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.
Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
