No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
There.
No.
Hey, sweet cheeks.
Where've you been?
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
Like you care.
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
Why?
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
Get out!
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
What makes you think he'll do it?
You got him involved?
Will Bogey get bent?
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
What've you got for me?
Hey -- do you mind?
Away.
Two legs, nice rack...
You just said
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
I'm on it
Hey.
What'd he say?
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
Were you in jail?
Do what?
BIANCA
So what's your excuse?
Acting the way we do.
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
Something like that
The duck?
I hate peas.
What?
No one else knows
You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
It wasn't like that.
I know.
I thought you were punishing me.
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
No, Daddy.
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.
We should have seen land.
Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
What is it, now?  Tell me...
How far from here?
How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
I have to explore the mainland.
Father...
I'm not bargaining!
You come!  You speak first!
Chief says -- how many?
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...
Esdras is a Jew.
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
I believed in you...
I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.
We don't need to know.
Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...
Six days ago, yes.
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
Yes.  Yes, come with me!
I was all of these.
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
I'm abused.  Don't you think?
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...
No.
Are you alright?
Is he your boyfriend?
I'll make some for us.
C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
Who did cause and origin?
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
Sorry...PD only.
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
You're Polish?
My folks are.
I'm on duty.
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
You wanna talk to her alone?
So am I.
Hey.  I'm a professional.
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
What do you want?
I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Alright.
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
Thank you.
That's unique.
Okay.  You ready?
Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film.
Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
Please join us.  Come on forward.
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
Did you hear what I said?
Sit down!
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!
We spent it!
What are you doing here?
Viewer discretion advised!
Well, he...
I want to hear everything he said.
Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
What??
Yeah?
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
CONTINUED
What's up?
It's possible.
That seems very unlikely.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
Well, that's something.
Are you reasonably awake?
You're kidding.
Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
Too bad about Frank, isn't it?
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
I am prepared to do that anyway.
CONINUED
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
That's true.
I understand.
I never paid for it in my life.
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
Hello, again.
How about it?
You're gonna help us take him.
Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?
Hey, this works pretty good.
Thank you.
I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
They saved your ass, convict.
I been waiting a long time for some money.
Half a million.
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
He's after your money.
We split 50-50?
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
That was quick.
Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.
Hey, you're right.
You're hopeless.
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.
You sure you want me to?
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
Jack, wait...
Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit...
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...
How about some ammo?
Akta dedero ansila do mektet.
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
You noticed...
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
When is she not in trouble?
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
I don't have time... I need to know.
I was talking to the cat.
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?
What mission?
Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.
And the third one?
I've had enough good news for today
I'm not going.
Three of us will never fit in there!
Apipoulai!
Love...
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
It's up to you now, Angel!
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
Exactly.
At least I won lunch.
Been here long?
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
...Not far, now.
Got it.
What's this... have you been smoking... ?
I love you.
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
Why the gun?
I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
Mrs. Christian.
I'm telling you...
It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.
I want to watch you work.
Machine.
What are these for?
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
Eddie.
I know what you did.
You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...
Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
Yeah.
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.
What the fuck do you want from me?
You enjoy it?
You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
Don't think I won't.
That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
That's right.
I was well compensated.
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
Truman Capote.
I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.
How long you been working there?
From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
How much do you make now?
You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.
Snuff films.
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
Uh huh, pleasure.
He's odd.
Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?
I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
People remember me from the news.  Can you drive me back now?
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
No... no... no...
Yes... I remember Mary
Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night.  The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman.  It's unpleasant, I know.  I apologize...
Alright.  May I have your phone number, area code first?
What?
Kincaid and Joey died last night.
I'm sure they're around.
My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
You look great!
I gotta get out of here.
It's lonely in there, in my room.
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
Who says I don't like you?
Very funny.
But Dad --
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
Had kind of a long night.
You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?
And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
Are you alright?
Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?
Who's Jacob?
All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...
Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>!  It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...
That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.
Reef!
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
I guess.
I think you're right.
Yeah?
Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!
Dave - !
Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!
Under <u>water</u>?
Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.
That's what I said!
A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!
Well, I'll be - !
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
What is the Northcountry Development Association?
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
Mmm.
I'm okay.
Hmm.
What happened?
Don't mind if I do.
In the chest.
Saw him do it?
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
Open the door, will ya?
Open the door. We're late.
Why do they do that?
Do what?
Did you do that when you were a kid?
To us it was.
I don't want to.
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait till we get home. Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's for a hamburger when we get to Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham's.
You're a policeman.
What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
What's the hurry?
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
Good. Who?
I'm sorry.
Tonight. Let's get together.
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
What way?
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
What the hell are you talking about?
Hold on!
Yes. Here's your ticket.
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!
Rolfe.
There was something. It happened up your way.
It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.
You think Jack shot him?
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
Yeah, I guess.
What about her?
That it wasn't an accident.
Then who shot him?
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
Well, I never heard that one.
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
Got it.
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
I prefered the terrorists.
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
Here's a press kit.  I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.
Leave my daughter alone.
What do you know of my husband?
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
You'll do it?
Madame Vice president. We have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks.
Sir, we stay with the President.
Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.
For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  Not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.
What's going on?
We're under attack.
This is the President.
You wanna knock of f?
Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.
Shepherd.
My god. I think that was a MiG.
How long's it been since you flew, sir?
Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.
What?
Yes I did...
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
Ted, what's wrong?
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.
Elaine.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
You mean...
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
I guess this is a first for you.
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
Have you got it straightened out now?
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.
Negative.
Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
Sixteen 'C', why?
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
You can't go in there!
Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
Captain, how soon can we land?
Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?
All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
But Ted, you're the only...
Good-bye, darling.
Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.
Roger.
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list.  Don't take it personally.
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
You okay?
You are Cassandra?
In there.
I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.
Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.
He didn't recognize me.
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
Nothing.
Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.
Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.
Uh, Matthew...
Matthew, you don't have to-- .
You know that guy?
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes.
We?  You've taken it?
No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.
Shit!
You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find... Well, this is it.
Only holds five.
Yeah, I heard of it.
The human?
No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.
Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?
Departmental policy.
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.
Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?
Can't lock up...
Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
How long until it blows?
Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...
What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
One of us?
Save it.
Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
Now many?
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
All right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest?
I'm sorry, Newt.
Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
I don't know, Newt.  That's the truth.
Where is she?
Newt.  Newt, wake up.
Wah...?  Where are...?
Come on.  Crawl faster.
Mommy...Mommy?
Can we dream?
His Grace is very angry with you.
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
What's that?
Why?
Don't bother!
What?
Oh - excuse me!
No! I won't have him back.
Hardly.
Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
What is it?
Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.
Yes, you are. You're very sick.
Yes.
Oh yes? You always know everything.
Yes!
Tell them to go!
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
Wolfi!
What does she want?
Yes, my love?
Why not? Half the house!
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
Why not?
No. Don't answer it!
How charming.  But why did he not come himself?
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
These are originals?
Tonight?
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?
He's doing his best.
But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
Gertrude!
It's just a trifle, of course.
My pleasure.
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
Sire.
Your Majesty!
Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?
Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.
Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?
Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here.
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?
How is your financial situation?
What's that?
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
Is he working?
That's right.
Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?
Well?
'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
Leave that alone!
Wolfi!
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
Well, we can.
Did you like it, then?
How could I not?
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!
Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
How could I not?
Who are you?
You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
No, please.
I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things.
What?
Of course.
Consigned to flames of woe.
Do you believe in it?
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
Do you have it?
Oh? Have I seen it?
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
What is what?
Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
So?
What do you want?
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
Yes.
What difference does that make?
Yes.
What anger?
For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
Well, promise then.
Yes, I am looking after him.
Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?
Yes, Doctor?
Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
Warn him?
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
Dr. Hirsch?
Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
I beg your pardon?
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
What do you dream about?
I dream of death mostly.
How old are you?
What? Oh, yes, please.
Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.
Now I'm embarrassed.
My friend Jack was just here.
David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?
I was awake and he was in my room.
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
Werewolves simply do not exist.
Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?
The zoo?
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
Hopeless. It's hopeless.
No what?
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.
Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.
Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.
What are you going to see?
You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten.
Yes.
David.
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
Okay.
Hello.
What do you think was wrong?
I have no idea.
What's the plan?
David! You're hurting my feelings.
What?!
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
Yes.
What about the zoo?
David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.
Hello.
Because this must be stopped.
Yes?
Hello, there. What can I get you?
Campari and soda would do nicely.
What's that?
I cannot accept a connection between David Kessler and last night's murders. We will find him, however. I can assure you of that.
Yes - sure
I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
Matt?
He has?
Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?
Whose death?
Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right.
How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans!
Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?
That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.
I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
This won't do. Not during business hours . . .
What is the matter with you? You're trembling?
But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.
No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.
Yes, sir.
This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
Much better this morning, thank you.
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
Yes, of course.
Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.
Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it, Helen. Just as quick as you can.
Yes, thank you.
No, sir.
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
Well, well, well - got your uniform, eh?
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
My wife? What's she got to do with you?
They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
Did you get the case for the securities?
Mine too?
Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson!
Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.
Absolutely.
No.
Hello, Helen!
Matt, come here!
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!
Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
Yes, why?
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.
What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
wasn't anywhere near this place
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
So you were home last night?
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
Where's Charlie?
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
Uhh, yeah it does.
No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing.
What have you done?
Cole, I want to get to the farm, make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay.
You are a fine figure of a man.
I think I recognize you.
What is wrong with you?
She had a moustache.
The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
Because we were good at it?  Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.
All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the "James-Younger Gang."
It'll be the biggest score yet.
Still smells fishy.
Okay, you're gonna rest here.
Tom, why don't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation? Figure we might have some work for you, if you want.
Cannon or Gatling?
BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!
Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --
The safe. Now.
OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
Of St. Louis?
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
Then why can't I go in there?
What is it?
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
My little Web did that?
Boys...
Distracting enough for you?
Web's dead.
Hell of a war.
You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?
Fine. How'd it go out here?
And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.
Maybe it started out that way. But now...
We're drunk.
Oh yeah.
Uncle Frank?
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
Zee.
She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
Let me see that.
Aw, shucks, ma'am...
What?
You get arrested again, I'll kill you.
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
I think so.
... too young for whisky...
Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
There's only four of them...
And it is my pleasure to be here.
Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards, killing several of them. Then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile.
How much did they get from the safe?
Parker.
What is that?
So you can't tell me anything?
What is that?
Dorsia's nice.
Pick me up?
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish. 
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
Evelyn?
We need to talk.
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
Yes, I am.
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God...
Tell him I'm at lunch.
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
No, not really.
Interesting.
Jean? Hello? Jean?
...to the office this afternoon.
Well.
Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?
Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.
I think his family wants this kept quiet.
Nice. Very nice.
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?
No. Not really.
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.
What?
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
People just...disappear.
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 
Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night.
Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you.
Is that a raincoat?
No way. You have this -- destiny.
That took some fun out of --
I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much --
You think I don't know that?
How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there.
I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me.
It's what they said it is. An unfinished broadcast studio. You were right... I just drove to Seattle and back.
I remember.
If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
That was -- different.
If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
And Outpost? You're happy there?
I do!
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
Milo. What's up?
I heard what happened.
Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there...
'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12.
Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time.
You calling Phil and Randy?
Come with me.
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
Time?
I told Teddy about you.
What'd he say?
The dishes are juiced up, too.
They know, I had no choice. Get out of the house now! Do you have a laptop?
Bring it to the other location.
...He knows.
Wanted to say goodbye to him...
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
You seem surprised to see me.
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
I'd rather talk about Number Two.
"Fifteen minutes of fame?" I'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either.
We know all that, Exposition.
Where am I?
Yes?
Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.
Excuse me?
Carnies.
Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair.
Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.
I've got you, Dr. Evil!
If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
I'm sure.
Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.
We can't just sit here, Austin.
Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.
I am not.
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.
Do you think she's prettier than I?
You know who.
Does that make you horny?
That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
Danger Powers, personal effects.
In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?
Thank you, Herr Doctor.
What is it now?
Sea bass.
That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?
Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.
Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors.  Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.
Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?
He's asleep.
You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?
We don't judge here.
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?
You
Have we met?
Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?
Quite a collection.
Quite right, but we still make the rules.
My number two. Special assignments. She's --
What are you trying to do to me?
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...
Of course. I planned that, too.
Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
Really?  I fail to see the connection.
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
June, July ... August?
I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.
You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.
Not quite. This is my field.
Is there anything that isn't?
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
Do you always drive this fast?
Barely.
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
And do you trust me?
I thought you played by the rules.
I'm playing to win.
You lied.
Why's he called 'Invisible'?
Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.
Our chaperon.
Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect.
You don't believe him?
Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.
Surveillance? By whom?
The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --
Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...
I shall need a small plane.
She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.
I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
I was at Harrow ...
You said ... one shot.
What's happening?
What do you mean?
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
Man, you're losing your audience.
Cole...
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away.
Ooh, be still, my heart.
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
Hi, everybody. Am I late?
I've tried to change her mind.
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
No, Cole, I...
Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
It looks awful.
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
Huh? Wha...
I can't trust you!
Let go of me!
Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
A real turd.
Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.  Hi, guys.
It's true.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
That's it.
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.
Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
It's on the tenth floor.
The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
Ed... you're kinky!
I'm separated.
Under the table!
I think you'll enjoy this table.
Who was that?
How about this, a Trojan donkey.
What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
Who?
Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.
Did you do it for Tim?
You gotta let me finish --
Why'd you come here, Brian?
What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
Jesus, it's too damn bright in here... Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin' blind...
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
I saw it.
-- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --
Huh.
Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
Hey.
I think your boss is going to need some spin control.
I quit two days ago, Brian.
I'll see ya around, huh?
I'm close... but I can't get who it is...
Trychticholorate.
Who the fuck is doing this?
Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier
But the right guess on this is arson.
But he killed these guys.
That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?
Are you going public with this?
And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.
Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
Nice boat.
Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
We gotta roll, Stevie...
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
You want some coffee?
What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
He's out.
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
Yeah? When was the last time?
Look, I'm sorry I --
Putty? On both doors?
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
And the world -- the whole world.
Yes.
So what are you doing here?
The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.
I forgive you.
You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.
I got them all going for Oakland. With bullshit money. We'll cover the $800.
I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money
Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!
Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!
What money?
You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids --
Get this, man. I was at the game today. Face to fucking face with Strawberry! Jesus! I saw him strikeout. And you know what? He looked at me, and I looked at him, and he laughed and I laughed and it was like we were all alone in that whole stadium and only we understood that it was all a racket, that he struck out on purpose, and that he's saving it up for the Big One. Tomorrow. Today I understood for the very first time that --
Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed.  Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And they are good boys.
Yeah!
C'mon.  It's easy.  It's the same thing y'all do out at the Yankee game, no different 'cept we changing one word.  Everybody go it?
I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place. That's right, the Mau-Mau's.
And another thing, you better stay away from my sister or you better...
De-la-croix.
What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time?
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!
Why?
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
How you sound?
I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix. He is the creator of the highly controversial TV show MANTAN. Let's get right into it.  You have been called by some in the community a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom. Why does your show generate such feelings?
Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.
The name of the show?
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
That's a great handle.
I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
Purely for medicinal purposes.
Dem white boys giving you a hard time?
Nuthin' I can't handle.
Let's get him over to the bed.
Manray was under our nose the whole time.
You lost me.
Sounds risky to me.
I'm in till the end.
It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.
Just want to say good luck.
The Jolly Nigger Bank.
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
I thought it was appropiate.
Is that good or bad?
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
I don't want to hear it.
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
I'm happy for all of us.  It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.
That's the way it came out.  Let me ask you one question.  Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?
Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.
Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
Peerless, your father called.
Richmond is not all the way down south.
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?
Not at all?
Finland.
Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
This is a TV show, not a music video.
You've never had any formal training, either?
No, we're not knocking boots.  I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.
I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.
This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.
To come back to our roots.
Oh her.
...yes she did.
Around...
...then what about...
...perfect...
Just a little something' somethin'.
You're sure this is a good idea.
After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.
I know I won't be your puppet.
It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion.
Dorothy might love me or not, as she likes, but Best will have to fight me before he marries her!
And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.
I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.
Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?
Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
Yes, sir.
No one, sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.
Who else can give me information about you?
Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?
I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady.
A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
Be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are?
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.
Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
All the same, you must name an amount.
I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.
Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.
Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.
I beg your pardon?
I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
Sir, let those laugh that win.
Dark Valdez.
And he doesn't care about me?
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
Bill Styles...
You too?
Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay?
You shot Childs and Nunez.
Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story --
Epilepsy.
What about the phosphorous grenade?
Sir, Dunbar, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
What the fuck is going on?
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
Look in my pack.
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.
No. I said Dunbar.
I didn't --
I don't know --
We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
What are you talking about?
Stay where you are.
You're right. We should sit in silence.
We're in the middle of a murder case --
You're kidding.
The very same.
But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --
Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?
And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.
You couldn't have known --
You know, you never told me why you left the army.
We need to talk --
You're a good man, Hardy.
Really.
Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
I don't think I want to hear this --
Maybe we shouldn't go.
The faggot speaks.
Yeah and he doesn't know when --
He said what?
You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you. You think you're just going to slide out of this? You're an accessory to murder, Levi, you're going to jail --
We all know what you did, Pike. I don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here, but --
So?
This is totally unnecessary --
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.
Welcome to ya. What's your name?
This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
Bloom!
Can I see him?
Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk. It's one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them.
Promise me you'll come back.
You must be Edward Bloom.
I'll...
Really.
That's terrible.
I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.
I like your stories.
Am I?
Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.
And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?
There's a lot you don't know about me.
Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about some things while I'm here.
Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
Oh.
This is why you don't show work in progress.
Hello.
Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
How is he?
I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
Mom?
You can see why it's sensitive?
I'm asking what you're here for.
Yes. I know.
We better watch him. He's crazy.
No.
No. It is too judgmental.
You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love.
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
I understand. I'm so sorry
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
Oh Jesus.
And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?
Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?
What's wrong?
So what are you going to do?
What?
What?
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
I don't want to talk about him.
Get out
You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world.
What?
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
You know you can come under the blanket.
How do you want to pay?
You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?
Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.
You ain't the kicker, are you?
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
We leavin' this weekend. Deke got a friend in Mobile gonna get him a job at the water company...
Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me!
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
GODDAMMIT, RAE!
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
I give ya enough chain so's you can get about the house. Get you to the kitchen. You need the bathroom, it'll reach.
No ma'am.
Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?
Gal, I been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. And let me tell you...
If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk.  Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  You know how to boil water?
By myself?
Now that's sharp. That's real sharp. Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't she? You like it?
Do you call it a game when only one man win each time? I think you call it a damn shame.
Why you say that?
Like I say, you wanna hook that up... I ain't in ya way. That switch of hers been all over this town. Got that sickness, you know.
What'chu sayin'?
First hooked up with that bitch when she was 16. Girl was fuckin' the principal and two of her teachers. You know coach Reynolds?
That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.
Goin' dove huntin'?
You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND?
I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...
Please don't tell my daddy.
Thank you.
I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
What?
Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya!
I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.
Back-up.
Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.
Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise me?
Frank Abolofia.
What'd you say?
Nick, we can't just --
... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side.
Joyce can be nice.
High spirits, desire, commitment.
You're doing fine, Ich.  Now drop it, okay?
She disappeared... shit!
It's very small.
It's illegal, Nick.
It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
Nick, you can't do this.
Just one, compadre... Kampai.
I don't know.
Thank you.  You have one?
I'm sorry.
Why's that?
Louder, pal, louder.
I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
She ever pull down her shades?
What if I chant?
Can't make you change your mind?
Save it, I already took the tour.
Why?
You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
Hey...!  HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!
I have to get to Sugai.
If I say no?
You certainly have a nice place here.
Can the maker repair what he makes?
Also extraordinary things.
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
He's not really my friend.  I just do a job for him now and then.
This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.
Six, huh?
Got it.
Well, when do you get paid?
Soon as I finish the job.
Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me.  Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image.  If that's true, whoever made Esper should have been shot.
You equipped for random questions?
Prosit.
My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?
Money?
Yeah?
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.
Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
Of course he's not real.  You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake?
Does it eat?
A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
Why should I be?
I'd take him to the doctor.
In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.
In your opinion.
You use your equipment, don't you?
So?
Yeah.
Yeah.  Sometimes.
But if I don't plug it in how can I...
Have you ever known anybody a long time?
Uh-huh.
Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone.
How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?
A tortoise.  What's that?
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
Whatcha doin'?
Just better.
My glands.  They grow old too fast.
Ah, you get hold of your friends?
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
How do you do?
Come where?
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
You're lost?
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.
So far?
I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me!
Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal with you!  I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel!
Heck, no!  What?!
I haven't brushed yet.
I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!
I think it's the eyes.
They like Dr. Pepper.
Wait! Wait!
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.
Where's he gone?
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
My goodness gracious!  This place is something!
That's ridiculous.
I know...and I'm really sorry.
Sing it to me.
Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?
My pleasure.
Yes, it is.
Are you all right?
Yes.
Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
Who use to own it?
Yeah.
I'm not wearing his pants.
Why not? He has great pants.
Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.
Thirty-five.
How old do I look?
I guess living up here makes people look older.
I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
Mom?  Eve and I have to go.
Well, where are you --
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
Oh, my God!
You got a light, honey?
Really?
How long will we have to stay down here?
I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
Home sweet home!
No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!
I've noticed.
If I...you know...
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
Should we say a little prayer first?
We do?
He's smart.
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
You came back for these?
Oh, yes.
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
To bed.
Gay.
Give it back to him.
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
Tower, say again!!
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
To your health, Frank.
Are you Detective Williams?
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
Okay?
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.
No.
Thank you. honey.
Yes.
You can hit me, if you want to.
Don't say that.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
Who is Don?
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK?
No. I should go.
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
Whatiya mean?
Yes.
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Does that scare you?
Shut up.
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death.
Dorothy. No!
Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
I guess I should go.
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
Oh no.
Who, Dorothy?
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Frank gone?
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too.
Yes, but.
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching.
What happened to him?
Now, how are you going to do that?
Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
Yeah, if it opens the door.
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Oh, okay, can I call?
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
What's with Mike?
OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
That doesn't bother you, does it?
You were late.
What am I going to do?
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
Dorothy Vallens?
Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
What did he bring him in for?
Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
Are these me considered armed and dangerous?
Any tips on where these guys may be?
Anybody you think is evil?
Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in.
What the fuck are you doing?
You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit.
You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.
Mother, is that you?
We're alive.
We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.
I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point.
Don't even do it, ya bastard.
I have no idea. Maybe someone saw and talked.
Charlie Bronson's always got rope.
I'm serious.
Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.
Who did you kill?
Give the guy a shot.
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
Where's my cat?
The Greeks. The Italians.
Now stay with me, boys. What did they do to make two such identical wounds? Did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? No. Two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and boom! That's all she fuckin' wrote!
Who the...
Why do you always disrespect me like that?
After talking to the dancer we know that their mark was the guy in the middle booth. After she watches them whack him, she passes out.  Why the two extra victims?
They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur.
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
No. You sure you're okay?
We'll keep going, Roc.
Hello? You there?
Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
Father, I'll do you right here.
I wouldn't have, uh, killed you, Father.  Dominus Ominus. Remember, you're bound. You can't talk about this... to anyone.
I always see you talking to the boys and making them laugh. They always come around telling me what a crack up you are. What is it they call you?
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
Right. The blond guy.
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
What does Starsky say?
This is he?
Now that window can never be locked. It's impossible.
That sets it off.
It had an alarm.
Yeah, I heard that.
I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
Because my mom gets the bill.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.
Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.
We said 48 hours.
Where was I?
So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --
I don't think we can do that.
I don't think we need any keys, Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car for us.
Don't panic, Anthony.
Sixteen dollars.
I know that. But --
Applejack would of got him anyway. This was just the quicker way.
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
Eleven fifteen.
God. Isn't this great? Working on the job. Got a wheel man. Got a safecracker. Good friends with Mr. Henry.
Freeze!
Come on.
What?
I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
Does it float?
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
It's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle.
What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
Why'd you want to help us?
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
There's a million places to hide around here.
I hope not.
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
It's in the driveway.
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.
There's a lot of valuable shit in there, Applejack. The silver and the china. The crystal. And the grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet that clock's worth ten grand.
That's Anthony.
You don't celebrate til it's over.
They are.
What was that all about?
The guy is fucking insane.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
His name was Swifty?
That's too bad.
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
Bob. Are you coming?
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
This could be a trap.
I can't do that, Bob.
You don't even know his name.
Yes, I do.
Come on in. What you been up to?
It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother.
That's OK.
I know it, man. Hang on.
I didn't think there was an alarm.
Do they let you --
How's that 700 bucks coming?
He said what?
Social issues. Crime prevention.
Dignan. Good to see you. Good to see you Applejack.  Who are you?
What do you mean grammar?
Yes.
We're closed, sir.
Hello, my friend. You in the Army, yes?
You like Chicanos?
You Hoto?
No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?
I want to know about Treadstone.
Let's talk about Conklin.
And Bourne? Where's he now?
Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln.  This is supposed to be definitive?
My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.
Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
Why not? It was just money.
I would want to know.  I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself.
Then what?
Is this really happening?
Conklin.
Pamela Landy?
She really did that? Told you not to kill me?  I had a woman once. But after a while, what do you talk about? I mean, for us. The work. You can't tell them who you are...
I'm sorry.
I'll get the book.
Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
Where --
...but you're not -- you're not sure...
Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
You drive.
Where are you going?
I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
Yes.
You hear me? I believed you.
And you got to him before we could.
You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
So when was I here?
My first job.
What do you want?
You didn't answer my question.
What?
I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
What kind of problems?
You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
Do we know what this says?
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
He won't come.
Wallace has sacked York!
Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation.
Three, maybe more!
A common thief.
No. He did not.
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.
And I with you. But you must wake.
This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?
I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
Why do you ask?
How. Did you. Know that?
Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.
We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.
Oh God... what did we do?
I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
Of course.
Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
Yeah?
I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
Sure you don't want your wallet?
Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?
What's happened to -- How are you doing that?
...yes.
That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
What do you need it for? I don't get you lately.
Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!
Lung cancer?
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
I thought I was the bad guy!
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
Good.
I recognize you from the news photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.
It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
Er, good luck, yes.
I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
And the carrying charges?
That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.
I observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man, Monsieur. I am moved to make one more suggestion, why, I do not know, because it cannot possibly profit me, but, have you heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of transit?
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
Not an easy day to forget.
No.
In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
Yes, of course, we --
No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?
Can I tell you a story, Rick?
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
Everything is quite all right.
-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
Does he always leave so early?
Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
Apparently he has the letters.
Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --
Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him.
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you?
Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
Had a close one, eh?
All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
Yes.
Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.
Even in Berlin.
Especially so tonight, Major. In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.
A leader, like Laszlo?
But I have no excuse to close it.
What is the meaning of that phone call?
Hello, Louis.
Rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe.
What, again?
I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.
Yeah? What's his name?
It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
Manages what?
Well, I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here. But I told my men to be especially destructive. You know how that impresses Germans?  Rick, have you got these letters of transit?
Put it down as a gesture to love.
Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.
You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.
I have. Sit down over there.
I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?
Call off your watch-dogs you said.
Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.
Give me another.
Sacha, she's had enough.
There seems to be no secret about that.
Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.
No.
For how long?
Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
Well, I ain't sleepy either.
You played it for her and you can play it for me.
Can't.  Need water.
Thirsty.
Take it.
No.
Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too far south.
Get water!
Fix raft first.
You quitter you quitter you quitter.
Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other people get through a lot worse.
I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.
To tell you the truth -- you did.
No.  that was the last one.
I had it on the island with me.
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
Got to follow the paper path here.
Merry Christmas eve.
This isn't working out.
We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last.
This is so unfair.
When's the next Jumbo?
Yes, yes he did.
You're Chuck Noland.
What happened to your pants?
Don't you even think about it.
Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.
You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army, could I borrow it for a while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's go.
We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice.
I'm serious.  The burning bush, the big picture, the words in neon...
That's all there is.
Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
How many months are you?
Is your family in the apple business, too?
And what did she die of, exactly?
That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?
Fine. That's all there is to it then.
Do you think she'll be all right?
I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.
I know where you can go. Homer and I can take you...
I never said they were boring.
Nobody's asked for me, have they?
So here is my candidate. What do you think?
He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
*Liver* killed him?
Uh... it's the end of October.
I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing a car like this.
Have you enlisted?
Has anyone offered you anything to eat?
It's almost like flying.
I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!
What business is you in, Homer?
I'm stayin', Homer.
He doesn't like it.  He's a boy, That's why.
Of course.
You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope.
I'm not in trouble.
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
*You* taught her, I suppose...
That what happen--you lost you only daughter so's you killed yourself! That's what we say, all right.
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
So, what do you do?
Oh. Well, thanks for the drink.
They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.
Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.
We had to finalize the deal.
Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?
Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake.
Just the last three weeks.
Keeping the Fix happy.
BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.
We were back on.
After you cut her loose.
So we go to the bar.
Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.
Big Al gets whacked mid-egg foo young. The whole thing took about two and a half hours. That's how good he is.
You can't cheat an honest man.
You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...
Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.
Let me repeat -- Why not?
Why?
I need you to stake me.
I think I just broke my hand.
Oh yeah. Moonan. I remember now. Thanks.
Sorry, I --
What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend?
What about... The money?
No.  What's my cut?
You get an equal cut.
Lighten up.
What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
Do you have something to prove?
Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would.
No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
WHAT?
Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober. I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something.
Jesus... Take it easy.
Everyone's working an angle, right?
So there it is. You got that big itch you need to scratch. It's all about the fucking money. What do you want, an apology?
If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
Escorts!
Stand up.
Can I speak to you in confidence?
Do you have any idea what those monks charge for that medieval torture?
The King, huh? Nice going.
Special Agent?
Like we told you before, we think he's into something with the King Pin --
Did he buy it?
Do you want to know the first time I had a line on Vig? He sent me a birthday card.  Belated, but it's the thought, right? Oh, this prick's got a sense of humor. But, then again you guys probably know him better than I do. In fact, I've only met the guy once. But now, now I have you. The next best thing. His partners. His "Fix."
What do you want?
You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross- departmental investigation. This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it.
Hope so. Those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me. One fifty every time they tighten those bitches up. One fifty! It's not even covered.
Jack Manfred.
I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that.
I despise the job.
Reynolds got a doctor in. They forced me to take a dope test. It was positive. As you knew.
Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now.  You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
Eight-fifty.
She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.
I couldn't resist them.
Probably.
He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.
Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
Gambling's not about money.
I hate public transport.
Great.
And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
The point is, they want a man inside.
But if it does.
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
Next time it'll be my neck.
I want you to forget what I said.
I don't think we should meet again.
How are you?
Have I?
I'm Lucy.
Nice car. How much did you pay for it?
I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like.
Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.
There are three types of casino in the U.K. High volume. Small faction. And MOTR. That's middle of the road. Us.
I have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond.
We check every four days.
Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.
Haven't you forgotten something?
What happens if I want to sneeze?
What makes you so sure?
Let me just run through a few things. As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. We'll need your picture.
I don't gamble.
Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
Girlfriend?
This is our Crow's Nest. I'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again.
Key? Key? What is the key?
Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?
It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.
Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.
Energy shielding positive function.
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
I am always receptive to suggestions.
That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
And you can only do it once, right?
I have no proof that it was false data.
Which one?
Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever find real intelligent life out there?
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
Must get lonely being up here so much.
...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...
Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...
Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?
Talk to the bomb.
Oh, yeah?
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
Call the skank now or I start redecorating.
What're you talkin' about?
But the boss knows I always been loyal.
What the hell are you doing?
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
Why would I be pissed?
Out there.
What're you looking for?
Can you help me get her back?
If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy, would you make sure she's okay?
What makes you cry?
If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.
Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.  But things will be better when we move to a new place.
Sophy?  Are you okay?
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
When?
Is the social studies class over for today?
Me?  You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.
Completely different situation.  I steal things in order to sell them.  For money. It's called commerce.  But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.
L-Triptophane...a neurotransmitter sometimes used in homeopathy to control seizures.  Then the lightbulb went off.
How well do you remember the lab?
The technical term for you is "chimera"...
A girl.
So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
Well, not me personally.
These girls, kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder.  The oldest is twelve.  The youngest about the same age you were when you escaped.
That was taken nine years ago... I.D.'d as Michael Hanover.  Sentenced to 18 months in the state penn at Rawlins, Wyoming for armed robbery.  He escaped from custody after 4 days.  Hasn't been seen or heard from since.
You don't want to.
My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
How do I know you're telling the truth?
And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble.
Nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners.  This kind of search...it's heavy spadework.  I'm gonna need--
You're crazy.
Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
Now, why can't I find a girlfriend like that?  Brings him lunch everyday, thoughtful, sweet, legs from here to there--
No.
A long time.
Friends don't help other friends cheat.
Please...
They're prisoners to their genes.
They don't have a lot of moving parts.
Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.
I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this.  You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country.  I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever.
Playing hooky again?
Feel like the dog's dinner.
Max--
Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
Easy Sketchy.
You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up.  What's next? Projectile diarrhea?  Man. What a stud, huh?
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
Hawk.
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
Ann Arbor?
But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!
What the fuck!
I think we should try sneaking in.
No... You don't think...?
Do you realize the sheer, goddamn, unadulterated, undiluted, no holds barred, one hundred percent pure as Ivory Snow, absolutely friggin' STUPIDITY of what you just did?
They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.
Don't worry about it. They're perfectly safe. We can pick them up after school. My mom won't be home. It's no problem.
Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes.
Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
Jeremiah... what's gotten into you?
So, you see if it wasn't for me, me and my friends would be at that KISS concert right now... together.
No. Much bet... I mean, much more sinful than that.
Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us!
The Chinese have a proverb: "That which appears too good to be true, usually is." There's gotta be a catch.
Look, you can have my wallet...
Two hundred bucks?
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
Beg pardon?
Why do they call you Frank?
What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!
Hey...
You're weird.
Where are we going?
Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.
They suspended me for two days.
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.
His name is Frank.
I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
Yeah.
Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
Frank?
If that's what you think is necessary.
Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
No. I took a year off to be with you.  Of course I care. Don't get angry.  What?
It is a big deal.
How did this happen?
Kitty, I don't know what to say. They've suspended him for two days.  Ever since this jet fiasco, I honestly don't know what has gotten into him.
Really, Loretta?
Thank God for bunge cords.
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
I gotta work with these women.
Oh, Amber...
Shut up, yous guys. Look, Amber, I'm not gonna win. And let's be honest, a family only needs one "Liza" and you know Peter's got much better legs than me.
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
What're you doin' here?
Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.
Hi...
Here, I'll take it. It's my job.
Okay... well, bye.
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
Tammy Curry?
This pageant's like a roach motel.
...You betcha. S'posed to be colder- n-a witches tit tonight...
I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
Enid ate a whole pan!
Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?"
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
From what I have been gathering, I think they think I should be king: I think they think I should be king!
The king can do to wrong! 
You can't say that to the President... Put back "President"... Now let's hear how sounds.
Dear Sir... enclosed find check for $100.  Yours very truly...  Send that immediately.
Yes, sir. 
What's the matter with you?
Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
I can't do it...
That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
We're not allowed to tell a dirty joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA
$50?
How're ya fixed for ammunition?
I don't remember.
If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.
Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
But -
What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
...but would further cement the relations of our countries.
This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...
Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.
You stay with me.
He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going.
I like doing business with you. You and I understand each other, completely. I know I can trust you. Can't I?
Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?
He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.
A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
Singularly unpleasant chap... uh... I don't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your... patient, Mr. Treves.
Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?
...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.
Oh yes?
Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?
It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
Thank you very much.
I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
...Yyes
Hello...
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside still waters. He restoreth my soul: He Guideth me in the paths of righteousness...
Righteousness...
Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John?
Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?
Good morning, John.
Mr. Treves, there is something I've been meaning to ask you for some time...
Yes.
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
Stand up, John. Let them see you.
Then I shouldn't change anything?
Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening.
But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.
Yes. John wants it.
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
Who, Father?
WHAT did you say?
WELCOME?
What's the matter?
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
But you LOVED her all the same...
I've never LOVED anybody!
YOU still want to go to Asgaard?
Then I shall come too.
But... How is it you can see me?  You can all see me?
Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing.
Well, how d'you think I feel?
He wants to kill US!
Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!
Ah.
I didn't mean to!
FIND the Rainbow Bridge?
But...
Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night.
It's Halfdan the Black!
What's wrong with making friends?
That's terrible!
We're missing all the fun...
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
Faster!
What are YOU doing here?
Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.
First we're flying -- now we're sinking!
Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
I came to find my grandfather.
Yeah... well...
Vanish into thin air?
Are you all right?
What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
That's right.
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
Are you going to let Erik wake the Gods?
I know, Dad.
I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
Shut up.
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
And you've got BOTH axes?
And keep your sword greased.
Shit. The last time I saw you.
But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
And I just liked you so much.
May I help you?
Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight!
I'm so excited. Yay!
I didn't have a chance to wrap it.
I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
I'm Joel.
I don't know what that means.
I don't need nice. I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anyone else to be it at me.
Okay.
My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you.
You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
What?
God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.
Well, I should probably get going.
And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
No.
Okay.
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
Where are you going?
Oh, thank God. It's going.
You're drunk.
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
I want my mommy.  I don't want to lose you, Clem.
Joel!
I'm done, Clem. I'm just going to ride it out. Hiding is clearly not working.
I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.
Probably.
I know.
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
Okay.
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
Me too. There's this poem --
Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"?
Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.
Yeah.
Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.
That's okay. I --
I probably got the same thing as you.
God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
How's it going?
She's so sexy.
So what's going on, Joel?
The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
How was it?
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
So you don't mind?
I hope you get your work done.
See you later, alligator.
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.
Hey.
Do you swear you didn't know?
Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
Oh.
The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
Order me a pastrami for after?
That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
Howard, they've disappeared again.
So, I've got to drop the van off.
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
She was unconscious, Patrick.
Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.
When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.
But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you?
Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...
...do you copy?
Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
Okay, listen up. As you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew. Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer --
...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...!
From what?
Will it work?
The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now.
I'm telling you, I saw it...
Can you shut it down?
To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep.
What happened?
Please...
It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
I want our best people on this. Where's Miller?
That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
...I don't want to die...!
I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon, every two minutes.
What's the hold up?
That means they didn't abandon ship.
Peters. We need to know what happened to the crew. Before it happens to us.
Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --
It's insane.
The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
Is that your "expert opinion?" The only answer we've had out of you is "I don't know."
I DON'T KNOW!  I don't know. There's a lot of things going on here that I don't understand. Truth takes time.
You're insane. You've lost your mind.
It is now.  We're locked in.
We're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready.
It tastes bad.
What's causing the readings?
We're armed. This fucker's ready to blow...
Weir.
He's been past Mars?
Where is she?
Foredecks. Crew quarters, bridge, medical and science labs, hydroponics, what have you. That central section connects the forward decks to the Engineering containment area. Can we move in closer?
What the hell is that?
The safety circuit's failed!
Get them back --
A straight line.
Yes.
He didn't.
Oh, he did.
Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
What did you wish for, honey?
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here? This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
We got what we wanted. That's enough.
They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.
We had a tough year.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
You're on fire!
This is wrong in so many ways.
Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
And if he's not...?
Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but --
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this to hit the press.
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
Well, uh, based on our history... you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics. Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
And reverse the mutations --
Of course. Of course.
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
Victor, I'm sorry I --
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
Brad, can I talk to you a minute?
Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.
What's there to do at the Point? God, Lisa, we've been going together almost two years, and...
Something happened to them, mon.
I can't find it, mon!
This is how I dress all the time.
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
Well, I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here.
I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.
I take out the garbage.
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
I'm just guessing.
Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do.
You're not going to tell me, are you?
Did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way?
Leave me alone!
You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
So are you.  Are you shaking?
What's wrong?
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
Why don't you call me up tonight?
Do you ever look at those girls who work at Swenson's? They're beautiful. And I have to stand out here and watch them six nights a week.
Did you get her number?
Really?
Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?
And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss.
Yo.
Are you Linda Barrett?
Who's that?
My brother is gonna shit.
Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.
It was nice.
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
How long does Doug take?
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
What do you think?
I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?
There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.
Aloha, Mr. Hand!
What about those other guys you live with?
We keep them.
Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual.
Really?
Two Cokes.
I checked the register for this man Thompson. We don't show him but I figured he might be part of your team.
You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends.
Naked!?
Las Vegas.
We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.
Where's the medicine?
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.
Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off?
Not me. It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it!
Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...
You bastard! I need a lawyer immediately!
Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet Barbra...
I gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe. Also, I told him I'd be there myself in an hour, and if she wasn't, I'd come back out here and rip his lungs out.
Right!
Fuck the car. They should make these things with a goddamn FM radio.
Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!...
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.
And the rest of 'em?
You seem mighty collected about this.
You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back.
Come on!
My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here.
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
What is this?
It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
You wanna see, baby?
He only shot you once.
The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.
Huh?
Max?
What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh?
COME ON!
Nothin' will happen to you. You get on my back, hold on tight and we truck out of here together.
There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
If there is only one way out for us, there is only one way in for them.
Her name is Charlie.
Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
Good morning, Mr. Bebe!
Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
My clothes?
It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
Frances.
Who?
Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
Claire?
Showdown.
Dick...
Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
...Don't you?
...I see.
No.
No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
...So what do you think?
Dad, here! You don't have to stop, just slow down. You can tell Mama I jumped out. She knows that's the kind of thing I'd do. She won't blame you.
Bread?
How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!
No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist --
But I'm not. The newspapers're --
I just wanted to see how you looked.
I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
I kick myself sometimes, but the thing is, I would have been miserable living his life.
You don't know what you want.
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
Harry... I met someone.
Who ever thought they'd be right for once? Jesus, Harry... it's a zoo back there --
I don't have what they want, Harry.  Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
No, Harry, I can't -- 
I just wanted to be part of something... one thing, one play or one movie, something that was really fine... memorable. And I could say: I did that, I made something good.
And?
Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.
This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.
You know something, Harry?
What a man!
Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
How did I look?
Why do you say that?
I'm not sure.
Where you goin'?
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
Yeah.
That's fine with me...  Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
Your big speech?
But they're using you!
What?
I think I need a little air.
Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who --
Yes...?
Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?
Normal. Average.
Stay calm, please.
No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
I'm sure you'll see it my way in the end.
I've never been shown a kindness. Show me one now.
I have been... afraid. Afraid... they will hate me... because I am so very ugly... and they are so very beautiful
Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother.
Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
Soon?
What is this?
Poor William! What indignant tears!
Have you seen Willie?
What kind of God is He to will this?
God took her from us.
This feels... incestuous.
Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
Your decision. For us.
I've no choice
So do I.
We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
Brother and sister no more.
You're a comfort to me, Henry.
They just caught the man who did it.
Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying.
Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
How much longer?
We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.
We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together.
Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer.
Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
What is your name?
It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!
Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
You're awake. I've prepared some broth. It'll help restore you.
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
You can only do what you can do.
It sounded like Brenda.
Where?
It's dead. Try the pay phone.
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
Why don't we run? Just run now?
Floor probably leaks. This area is full of springs.
What hath God wrought?
Ow!
Steve taught me how to use the emergency generator. The town power lines are supposed to be real shitty.
Wind's up. It's shifted a good hundred and eighty degrees.
What about Neddy?
I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
Yeah. I got it on before this --  -- all started.
Just my son and I.
I meant me, my son and my daughter.
No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.
Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up to you?
Yeah, follow us.
So let's do it.
It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
Yes.
Then?
He backed down.
Now, is your shit together?
Did he...?
My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
Dad, when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist. Mr. Franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back. He said when we come home, if you still feel the same way --
It's a flop house.
I promise.
Not good enough, swear to God.
Where are you taking us?
Yes.
Do you believe me?
Yeah.
Are you okay?
How many bullets left, kid?
Should I use the last bullets on us?
Not even for lunch?
Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
I wasn't scratching!
Best in Mexico.
She's in the other room.
Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you?
Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.
Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
Where are you right now?
The woman I saw you with...
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
Uh, V.I.P. security arrangements generally take some time, Senator.
Really, I have no problem with --
Pardon the hour, sir.  But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way.
It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment.  It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.
I can't afford civility, sir.  How am I supposed to fit in with these guys when you've got me set up as an outsider?  Even if I make it under these rules, I still lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file -- "Yeah, she made it, but..."  I mean, really -- why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base?
Fine by me, sir!
Shit.  Think we're had.
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
... last few years have brought many advances in the interests of women in naval service, particularly in the land-based maritime specialties. What's more, the Navy has instituted special sensitivity courses with an eye on --
"The Lark Report."
I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --
So everyone I talk to says you're top drawer with silk stockings inside.
Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch tomorrow?  I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --
So she picks the women, we pick the programs.  Seals?
Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect you just showed me.  But I don't need it and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway.  It's just gonna hurt us both, okay?
If you can't feel the other guy's pecker, you ain't in tight enough! I want nuts to butts!
O'Neil?
I've had it.  Just because they pay me like a baby-sitter doesn't mean I'm gonna be one.
She's an officer.  There's a higher standard.
She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
Unless you Whiskey Run.
You expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare-back?  Is that correct, O'Neil?
This has nothing to do with you.
I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it happen.
Jordan...
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
Well, let me warm you:  I'm going though with this.  The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?
That's not what I want, Jordan.  I mean... it is and it isn't...
And this class officer... "Wickwire."  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for...
Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?
I can't go out.  Not like this.
'Cool?
I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.
"Dad."
The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them.  Because you went soft on another women --
Well, I'm trying to figure out if you're stupid, unlucky, gluttonous -- or some new alloy of all three.
Well, who the shit you think you are?  Comin' in here like that?
Clear.
Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.
Maybe we should call the Coast Guard.
Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...
I take it this file is still open.
What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
How long where you and dis guy goin' steady?
What are you doing?
Think we can fit up in there?
He's not going to do it.
Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?
You're still mad at me, aren't you?
When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change.  I never lost my idealism.
...he's pregnant.
Nesting?
I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you.
I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
My life sucks.
I can't believe he put the moves on me. After everything I've done for him.
Did Romeo have a name?
Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
And you're beautiful...
Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
You don't understand, I can get us information...
I'm sorry about all this.
Merde!
Have them sealed off.
Major, what do you think could have done this?
It's Tatopoulos.
Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.
You know, he's not an enemy trying to evade you. He's just an animal.
Three eggs. I thought there would be more.
How do I do that?
Just don't.
This is it?
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
At ease men.
We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
You go first! There's no time!
What?  What?
It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
I was staying in character.  "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
He's a twit!
You think you could do better "Laredo?"
This is ludicrous.  Why are you listening to this man?  Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?...  He's no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow.  No offense.
WE'VE HAVE TO STOP!
No I didn't.
... Yes?
Brandon, I remember you from the convention, right?... You had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and I spoke sharply to you...
Yes Commander?
How did you come to that conclusion?
The enemy is matching velocity.
That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
What does that mean?!!!  Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
A hologram...
THAT'S why you built this ship?
How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
We're doing episode 31?
We're alive!
But I'm the Commander!
It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF...  The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it.
All right... here's the plan:  First, Fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then Gwen, Alex, Fred and I go down to get the sphere.  Any of those things come back, give a signal. Guy, you set up a perimeter.
Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
Gwen...
Unbelievable.
You know, that's really getting annoying.
Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13.
My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
But Commander... The negotiation... You... You... You fired on him.
It's perfectly safe. I promise.
Excuse me?
Could be this.
Oh, right, sorry.
Okay... On what?
Some say that Hessians are invincible.
You'd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness.
You seem pleased by the prospect.
Go on... I want to hear everything.
Gates?  He used my battle plan and I humbly submit that without me he'd still be back at Saratoga waiting for the British to attack.  George, why haven't you moved into the Potts' house back at the creek? Much more befitting of a Commander and Chief than your field tent. And... you could entertain.  I think you need to entertain more. Seriously!  Get a few New Jersey whores up here, invite some Congressmen... couldn't hurt.
They love Reed and his inquisition! I think they hope to share in his disgusting profits!  It's becoming the American way!
Yes, general?
Wil, I want to remind you of a conversation we started just before Monmouth...
Well, what have you thought?
No, my lord.
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
To hell with Arnold...
You won't be needing his largess, Rhode Island is already committed to your appointment.
I tell you every damned place I go the man is adored!  "General Washington!  Champion of Trenton! Savior of the Republic!"  And you should hear the way people are deprecating Congress!
Oh, come now...
You think that?
Finally!?  It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more.  More ale, here!
Congress is bitterly opposed to allowing Negroes in the army!
Joseph, the British spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that Arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges.  In my opinion he saved my army.
I mean, I'm a Deist.  A belief I share with the likes of Tom Jefferson and Ben Franklin.  Surely you knew that.
But the Hessians are there!  No one can beat them!  That's why Cornwallis stationed them there! They have the post of honor!  They are invincible!
How many generals do we have like Arnold?  He's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights!
'Continentals', Congress' paper money.  It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless.  Can you tell which one is fake?
Because, if the British got off their asses and came up here, now, we would be smashed.  And the revolution would be finished.  Tell King Louis, it's that bad.
Of course, if it were that simple.  These people?  They're after something else...
Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church?
What else?  From Virginia?
Some things must never change.
Martha!  For God's sake!
Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs.
I will not betray you, Nathanael.
Well, the widow Curtis will bring you riches, position, land, even half-grown children.  You won't have to do anything at all!  You shan't have to do another thing to prove yourself.
I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
I don't laugh at you, George.  I like you.  I like you because you will never, ever make it as an aristocrat... and that's because you're completely incompetent at hiding your feelings.
I've been surprised in an unguarded hour, But must not now go back; the love that lay, Half smothered in my breast, has broke through all, Its weak restraints, and burns in its full lustre.  I cannot, if I would, conceal it from thee.
Yes!
Shit, now someone's gotta climb down there and get him.
You guess? You mean you don't know?
I heard in the Federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the glass with your Daddy on Father's Day.
No. What's this?
You think I'd be standing here? You set somebody up and you want it to work, it has to be a surprise. Can you remember that?
So... how many movies you been in?
Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money.
No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
What about her?
Who?
I really think I can be of service on this one.
What money?
I can't believe the way you guys do business out here. I can't believe how fucked up your organization is.
You know Laurel Canyon?
I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel.
Man, I can't wait for you to be dead.
I can't do it.
You positive about that?
Listen, Harry, how would you like to get your hands on five hundred grand? You pay me back at your convenience, no interest.
I don't know.
Okay. So who are you?
Yeah? Which terminal?
You a quick draw... 'bro?' You better be, your piece stuck way down in your belt like that.
I'm in the movie business.
Leo spanked a waitress?
Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores.
It's the kind of situation, you don't pay, you get your legs broken.
Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone.
A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my "Driving Miss Daisy".
Just a thought.
You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.
So how 'bout it, Mr. Selznick, do I make my deal with Bo? Or you gonna finally help me out, have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him.
Forget about Leo's money, Harry.
You have it?
Who?
If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?
Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas.
The wife sues the airline.  This is a gutsy babe.
At that point, basically, that has to be it.
Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons -
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
Then you've read it?
Depends, who pays?
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
Yeah?
Harry... My God...
What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway?
They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
Hey, Chili.  Get your coat, but don't piss the guy off, okay? It could get complicated and we'd have to call Momo to straighten it out. Then Momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we don't need that.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
You seem to feel fine about it.
When I came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. I told you to turn off the TV when you were through.  Come to think of it, I also told you you could sleep in the maid's room.
Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.
With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
A passenger liner, north island. Over.
What is the vessel name, registry, and present position? Over.
North Island, please repeat? Over.
Fucker!
Where from?
Probably slipped her moorings, got tangled up in a current.
Ready?
Last thing we want is extra partners.
What say, Epps? You up for some roasted albatross?
It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size.
It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it.
How long?
Three, four days.
Or somebody stopped them.
You gotta be kidding? What the hell we need that tub for, we got fifty million bucks?
On a passenger ship in 1953?
I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
If money can buy what he wants.
We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first.
Morning everybody.
Then why didn't they take it.
Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
So what did happen?
What guy?
Are you sure?
Guess that'd be me. Again.
They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.
The same day she supposedly went down.
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
Epps, over.
What do you think?
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
The number nine on the starboard side's half flooded. Epps says it's a slow leak just under the waterline, about twenty gallons an hour. They must've pumped it before we left Sitka.
I must be in the wrong business.
Shut up.
He took the shotgun and a light.
What about the gold?
Leave it.
Did I tell you who I ran into at the bagel place?
Hi.  Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.
I guess.
I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...
Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.
Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...
But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
What the hell is wrong with you?!
Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
Aren't there a million places like this?
Forget it.
Why?
You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!
Hi Enid.
What?
What? Why?
Hi.
Did you sign up yet?
Or maybe not.
Who can forget this great hit from the 50's?
God, this paper is so boring. Who reads all this shit?  Here we go...  "Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ, maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh!"
Look at how cute I am!
I bet! Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame, fake shtick.
Look, maybe that's him!
He's insane!
He doesn't even look that bummed out, really.
This is way too creepy.
It's always closed...
I'll bet he never jerks off...
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
What? Where?!
I don't believe you.
I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get a beer.
You won't believe it! Guess!
God, how can you stand all these assholes?
That rules!
That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers!  Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.
Are you kidding? It's a dream job! I can't believe you got a job like that without even trying... God, I wish that was my job...
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
This is it? I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff.
Go ahead...
Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...
You're insane.
Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went.
So should I come over?
It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!
What? When did you see Josh?!
Please let me come with you. Please please please...
What time?
Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
Really? Both of you?... Why not?
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
Do you have any other old records besides these?
If you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what I'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside!
Hi... what's your name?
I hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago... There are no buses on this street.
You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine.
Why do you even want it? It would look stupid on you.
Do you have any old Indian records?
Oops! I dropped it!
Really? Can I see it?
No you're not! You're a cool guy, Seymour.
I appreciate the offer but you really don't --
Wow! Look at all these creeps!
Yes, that would certainly do...
You work at Cook's Chicken?
What? Why?
Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.
Oh yeah?
Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
Why?
Never mind, it's way too complicated...  Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?
Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called before once... it's just somebody trying to humiliate me.
Hi, it's me...
Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk...
No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?
I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...
I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person. I just don't want to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...
Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
I'm just being realistic.
Yeah, sure. Of course.
I guess I probably used to when I was your age.
It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and I'd just disappear and they'd never see me again.
I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want?
What do you want?
Talk to us about it...
Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here?
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
What are you talking about?
You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm Robert Beaumont.  Firm- I like that, tells me a lot about you-  -now why don't you tell me about me? To get you started, many people find me handsome, with a wonderful smile. I'm sure you agree.  Winning personality, heaps of charm?
Then why do you stay?
I know it's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey-  -but what are you going to do about it?
All right- you'll spend your nights inside.  You'll have plenty of ammunition. You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.
Not once?- you didn't hit it once?-
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
We need to talk.
Actually, no.
It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
What happened to them?
I'll have to.
We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night.
Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?
And where will you sleep beautifully?
You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
Do you need anything?  You want me to come in?
No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this.
I won't.
Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?
His name is Oscar.
Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?
This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it.
Peter, what about the bathtub?
They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?
For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century.
According to my sources, the world will end on February 14, in the year 2016.
It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter.
So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them.
I'm not sure this is such a good idea?  Do they know you're doing this?
We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman.
You know, I never got to ask you.  Where you from, Johnny?
So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
Boys, listen.  You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?
Who was that?
This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
If you two are looking for a fight, you got one.  Who wants it first?  Come on, Ray.  Try me, sucker.
There's definitely something going on in that studio.  The PKE levels were max-plus and the Giga-meter was showing all red.
Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.
Who?  Who?  Who?
Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you.
I'll keep to the middle of the channel. We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th.
My great-grandparents were Swiss.  I still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived.
She's moving!
Roy?  Your clock broke.
To the bathroom, where do you think?
Eight o'clock?
Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
Oh, Dana, it's you.
... and then I opened the door again but it was gone.  There was nothing there.
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
Like a used car salesman.
What?
I told you, I ...
This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
All right.
Really!  Is it gone?
But why?  The students love us!
Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
I collect spores, molds and fungus.
I think it's the food of the future.
In the physical sense.
Why don't you step into the office and we'll talk about it.  Hold all my calls, Janine.
Janine, I'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry.
Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
You could say that.
And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?
What on earth gave you that idea?
I agree.
He wants to shut down the storage grid.
Who?
Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?
I told you it's real.
You'll never regret this, Ray.
My parents left me that house, I was born there.
Are you a Christian, Ray?
What's he talking about?  Choose what?
More wine, sister?  Surely you can drink more than that.
It's disgusting!  Animals!  I had to come here under armed guard.  Slaves -- get this junk out of my sight.
Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.
I want that bastard dead!
Do you expect Marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience?
Gladly Caesar.
Caesar, ignore them.
I'm serious.
We must obey our emperor and the Senate.
Underdog!  How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  I'm the emperor why can't I kill him?  He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.
Why isn't he dead?  Damn you, you promised me he would be dead!
This is Cos, this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've invited him to write a small piece about you...
So tell me, what happened between you and the emperor?  What really happened on the German front?  You know the Senate's arguing your case...
You know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace.  Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years.
I've read of it.
Sneaking around with your brother?
I don't believe that.  He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.  You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany.
You mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist.
To think I brought my daughters up on all things Roman.  Read to sleep on Catullus, Lucretius... Virgil... every night.  My beautiful daughters.
Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
If I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... no, again, it's my own bullheadedness. Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago.  And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son!
They fear me.
Don't stop to visit -- take the children straight home and I'll follow as soon as I can.
Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate!
You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand!  Narcissus, the Republic is dead.  You think those Senators could govern?  For the last hundred and fifty years they've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of Imperial asses!
Greeks?
What about their philosophy lessons?
I can see that...
I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
Narcissus!
I killed too many barbarians.
What would the poster say: "Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii Olive Oil?"
I can really rape them on this!  Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?
No -- why should I?
Could you do it?
I want to go home.
What?
Listen -- could you stop crying, please?
Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
Was she married or something?
Yes.
And it's all over now.
I'm meeting someone.
Where did he say he was going to meet you?
Here? In Berkeley?
Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
No.
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.
Is that so? You might marry me?
I don't see how we can.
Elaine -- are you serious about this?
We could go down and get our blood tests tomorrow.
Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.
Are we getting married tomorrow?
Hello -- who is this?
Is the doctor anywhere?
Yes, I will.
You a student?
What?
It's all right, Mr. McCleery.
What did you do to her?
All right, boys -- I think you can get back to your rooms. I don't think we'll have any more of this agitation. Will we, Braddock?
I am going to call the police now.
Could I make one phone call first?
Yes.
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
Did you get a room?
I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?
No.
Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
What for?
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
Look -- I think I should be going --
All right. Now finish your drink.
Yes.
Why is it?
Get away from that door.
Oh my God.
I haven't. No.
Do you want to?
Yes?
The number.
Will you bring me a hanger?
What?
Thank you.
Benjamin, is this your first time?
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
That you're afraid --
Good. I mean are we dead or something?
Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.
You're not interested in art?
What?
Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
But what about the noise from the car. What if --
The driveway's on my side of the house.
No we don't.
But you don't hate him.
Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
Art.
Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
No.
I have my reasons.
We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --
I see.
Yes. Please. I want you to.
Go home now.
I say I've got it.
Sir?
Yes. Well -- goodnight.
No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
What?
Oh, no.
Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --
Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?
But I don't want you to make up something.
No -- they don't.
Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
Oh no.
You'll never be young again.
Quite a while.
Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
Now look -- please --
I am not threatening you.
Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
Hello.
I'm having luck for the first time in my life.
I oughtn't to presume, but I --  I'm so grateful to you -- it's been so marvelous. The first time in my life I have gambled -- I've danced! Oh, you can laugh, gentlemen, but it's the first time in my life I've ever tasted life!
You are late -- the dancer's gone to the theatre.
Yes.
Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
Like dancing?
Oh!
Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
Am I quite strange to you?
Yes -- I do understand.
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
The stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?
I want to be alone.
No?
Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night. 
I want to be good to you -- madly good.
Very early in the morning.
Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
Don't do anything foolish -- I'm alarmed about you.
I'm going to change and we'll meet for a drink in the Yellow Room.
Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
If I could get into a game I might win some.
Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
Pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me.
No -- letters to two-eighty.
Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --
What? -- Who? -- Whom?
I don't know.
I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he is ill.
Her master's voice!  I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.
Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man might --
Please -- please!
Oh -- oh, Miss Flaemmchen. It's you --
Do you like me better?
What?
Cotton Company --
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? 
I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business.
Wait -- I must figure it up.  First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold in England in March, I'll need a suit... You'd want me to look nice?
Come here. 
If the Preysing people get the Manchester contract, we shall certainly merge with the Preysing company -- but if they haven't they're ruined -- Preysing will have to declare himself.
There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company. They've the whole English market right in their hands. Have you any connections with -- Manchester?
Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon!
Yes --
If you actually have news from Manchester then...
See you soon, Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details.
Good morning, Suzette.
Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train.
Hurry, Suzette.
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.
Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the conference is already underway.
That.
No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on... 
What the fuck are you doin with a son?
He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.
You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh...
He's a good kid. A salesman.
Your kid's in the back here. He's crying.
The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.
And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.
What? He's going to be all right!
His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo.
Take two, three days. Call when you get there.
I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see.
That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?
I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks.  Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.
Thanks, uh, Lilly.
I guess I owe you my life.
I can take care of my own bills, Lilly.
Not as tough as you, huh?
Sure.
Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
You want a drink?
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
A bad mother. By any standards. I've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. I know just how bad I was.
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --
Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?
I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
Roy?
What are you talking abut, Myra? Marriage?
You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?
I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me.
I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
You were right, I had to get out of that hospital. Nothing wrong with me any more.
What happened to Cole?
I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole.
You -- I don't know.
I went out to Delmar.
You must have some very knowledgeable friends.
I don't think I need it.
No! Because I --
Yes?
Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here.
Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun.
Not many laughs in this room, eh?
Why am I here?
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell.
Carter.
Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Hey, Mis Whittington, what's up?
My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
Oh.  Sorry.  I'm on my way to the ring and --
Nothing to fear.  The coast is clear.
I'm sixteen, Keri.  I should be able to live wherever I want.
It's an option.
You some kind of fugitive or something?
Now you're joking, right?
He found you, didn't he?
Yeah, me too, Keri.
Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
Where'd you get it?
Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
Not me.
I can see that.  Why?
Then you come out here.
You look kind of cold.
Linda!  He killed Linda!
Michael Meyers.
So you're really Michael Meyers' sister?
Wait.
Condom Boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria.
But the dance is in the gymnasium.
Why?  You interested?
Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
Whatever happened to women in back?
Happy fuckin' Halloween.
Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!
Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another storm.  Try to get some sleep.
Mommy!!!
So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know. Now I'm afraid he could be next.
Where are you going?
Danny!  Danny, where are you?!
As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
This is madness, Wynn.
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
Jamie's baby ...
Samhain.
Yes?
It's a bitch.
We've never met.
Home, sweet home.
You know what gets me about that Cadillac?
When I drive it, I feel like I'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  I don't hear anything, I don't feel anything.  I figure somebody else is driving.  It's a bitch.
Leave me alone!  After eight years of horrendously close association, the time has come to part!  I crave solitude and time for reflection-- and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood.  You and I may not meet again for months!
I'm certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow, and I will not welcome your horning back into mine.  A chapter has ended.  We are old comrades--at a parting of the ways.
You ever own a motorcycle?
You're right!  We'll take a trip. A trip is what we'll take.  I don't want to talk about motorcycles.  I don't want to talk about tits.  Go home!
Huh.
When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.
You're so low!  Look at that beautiful red meat.  You haven't touched it.
Sorry.  At least you've got a place to come back to.  I don't have a place to come back to anymore.
I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?
Maybe it's time you got out.
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
They were enemies.  We were at war.
I can't get over how you guys are my friends.  Harold Ryan and Looseleaf Harper are my friends.
I've considered that.
It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
As a matter of fact--I am home.
Hello.
Ask it!
Do you know who Wanda June is?
She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess.
I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?
He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother.  You know what he called Father one time?
I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand.
Wow.
Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet?
Go on.
When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
It's rather a disappointment these days.  It isn't there any more.
Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
Can I get dressed first?
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
Nothing.
Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
I'm engaged.
Daughter--I love you very much.
You are woman.  I know woman well.
Like hugging a lamp post.
Disease?
Say hello to your mother.
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
A trip, you mean?
You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.
All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow.
People now have dignity when frying eggs?
Tell me about its sexual roots.
I'm dying to hear of his reaction. The thrill of smashing something isn't in the smashing, but in the owner's reactions.
It seems highly intelligent to me.
Sounds quite beautiful.
I'm teaching my son to be a man.
So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
Honor, I suppose.
I feel mocked, insulted, with no sort of satisfaction in prospect. We don't have to fight with steel. I can fight with words.  I'm not an inarticulate ape, you know, who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary.  Call him up in East St. Louis, Penelope.  Tell him to come here.
No, we won't.  No matter how it begins, it will end in death. Because it always does.  Isn't that always how it ends, Harold--in death?
I mean it!
All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
Hello?  Oh--hello, Mother.
...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.
Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is.  That's how it goes.
Safe and sound, I see.  Oh--you came back.
Good Lord.
I thought she was a widow.
Now who's being cruel?
I'm high as a kite.
Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  Simple butchers like you are obsolete!
I've poisoned you. HAROLD  Lucretia Borgia?  Something I drank or touched?  You refused a cigar.  That's it! Potassium cyanide in the humidor! Treacherous lover of peace!
I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind.  It's saying, "Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown, clown, clown."
The new hero is you.
Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  He will soon be extinct.  It's time, it's time.
No.
Thank you--for my life.
It's trash now, like mine.
What are you going to do?
There was so much going on.
So long, you guys.
Mr. Ryan just borrowed my birthday cake.  I don't really know him.
Don't touch me.
No.
You're married!  You've already got a husband!
Is Norbert still here?
Then get him.
My father!
Please--
I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.
I see.
Coming.
What then?
What's the matter now?
The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.
As long as he keeps out of the park.
That's the XKE.
The what?
It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
If you warned him against it as much as you say, it's almost a certainty.
I wish Paul luck.
Paul's only twelve years old.
We've got to rescue him.
It's a jungle out there.
I'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now.  She's going to East St. Louis--to visit an aunt.
Is that a fact?
None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
It was almost worth the trip--to find out that Jesus Christ in Heaven was just another guy, playing shuffleboard.  I like his sense of humor, though--you know? He's got a blue-and-gold warm-up jacket he wears.  You know what it says on the back? "Pontius Pilate Athletic Club." Most people don't get it.  Most people think there really is a Pontius Pilate Athletic Club.
No. I don't think so.
I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. I'm sure you're very good, but at the moment, I've got nothing for you. If something comes up, we'll give you a call.
I said I hope she's a runaway. Better that than she just disappears like so many others do. Sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. These are realities.
Pull out your cock.
I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
Is this all the display space we can get?
Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
What's that shade of blue called?
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
Joanne?
You know her?
Up front?
Of Joanne's?
'Sucking off.'
You used to work at Copper Penny?
He deals in pain.
Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.
Tod'll meet you at the bookstore at Eddy and O'Farrell tomorrow noon. I told him you were a 'specialty' customer.
Where does he live.
They are the same.
Look, I really don't know your daughter but...
Look, Niki, this really isn't my business. I don't know anything about...
Well, what do they know?
Hey, I'm a private detective, Van Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them.
And better?
This used to be a real city. I was here about fifteen years ago. Embezzlement case. It was always a little religious for my taste, but at least it was a city. With a downtown and all.
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
Yeah. You ever seen any of those?
Yeah.  All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
I ain't cheated you, Pilgrim. This is research, damn it! That girl could have told us something.
Pretty good.
I think I've found a way to find Kristen. I have a plan. But I have to be alone.
God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing.
Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from Mexico. And that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know...
Who told you about this?
It's a short film.
This is from the movie I was talking about.
My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
In other words, you want to get laid?
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
Who's that?
Hey, piss-head, what brings you around?
'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.
I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
Took it?
Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.
Check.
And that truck - is it registered in your name?
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
Where are the papers?
It's a question of emphasis, you might say. Accentuate the positive, so to speak.
Eh, no.
Sort of.
How about some ginger pie?
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
Do you often model for Glaucus?
No. 
Don't you think we should get some tools, maybe?
It is kind of rough.
Well, I really don't drink...
Thank you.
Well, I don't...
The ice is melting.
I'm sure picking up on vices.
What was that?
What is it, Harold?
But they'll put me in jail.
How about some candy floss?
You sure have a way with people.
We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
But you're not going anywhere, are you?
Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.
Please, don't you realize? She is dying.
I have a sore throat.
I'm getting married.
Like a tea ceremony?
I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.
I see. Junkyards. What is the fascination there?
No.
I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?
Your classmates?
Yes.
Yes.
I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?
Jeez! That's a great story,
How about hand-to-hand combat?
Boy, to think I could maybe make my own.
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.
See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank.
Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!
Yes... Yes. You look...
I want to go back!
I knew you'd come back.
Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
The boxes! I TOLD you.
O.K. Let's go.
I'm scared.
What is this? Someone else you think escaped us, like Frank?
Easy, easy. Whatever happened, whatever you saw, it's not here now.
Don't get psychic with me.
The freak in the gas mask --
Cordon off the area. Something came through.
C'mon -- Rasputin??
What the hell was that? An ape?
I thought you liked being on TV.
Son. About Rasputin --
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
We're on the move.
They're not speaking. Professor Broom had him grounded.
What are you trying to say?
Those things never work. Never.
Yup.
Thank you.
Oh. Uh. Hello. I -- I have these. For you.
Whatcha looking at, John??
Yes?
"Need" is a good, solid word.
We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's crazier every day. And Father's still mad at me --  Come back, Liz. Come back. I --
Goodnight, then.
Red, I --
Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
I admire him. He's a force of nature.
This isn't happening.
Don't look at me.
Tell me who you are.
His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some?
You're still afraid.
You can't love him.
I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.
It's ONE of these.
Like who?
So what's the argument?
Larry!
I'll be scarred for life.
I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.
Sure.
Just a moment. Put on some music will you babe?
Is this upsetting you?
What's wrong with you?
There's a first time for everything.
No, not much.
Let's keep it that way, shall we?
First time for everything.
Oh Christ.
Who brought me in here?
I got through.
What did you say?
O.K.
Big house.
You like?
Is Julia here?
No. It's all over.
Just trying to get my apartment in order.
What?
Just go. PLEASE. I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad. He'll look after me --
How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
What do you mean, "what?"
Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash.
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
Fine by me.  I still want pay to 7 o'clock.
Un-fucking-believable.  Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all.
What band?
I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
Haven't seen it.
Like fuck you are.
Sonic Death Monkey.
What do you think?  Dick likes it.
Holy Shiite!  What the fuck's this?
Nothing.
Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack." The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right? "Dead Man's Curve," Jan and Dean...
The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite.  Do you have an appointment?
Can I go home and work this out and let you know?  In a week or so?
Oh, I'm sure I can manage something... "Sin City." "New Rose," by The Damned. "Hit It and Quit It" by Funkadelic. "Shipbuilding," Elvis Costello, Japanese import, no horns, or different horns, anyway... um... "Mystery Train" by Elvis Presley... And... "Spaced Cowboy" by Sly and the Family Stone.  A bit controversial, I know, but...
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
Yeah.  A billion.  Right... How are you?
Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
Hey.  Didn't you steal that one already?
Are you all right?
I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff.
I understand, Dick.
Let's not.
It's Vince and Justin.
Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.
Can I help you?
We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
So shall we leave it at that then?
Jeez.  He goes on long enough.
What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
Well if you could tell me roughly it would help.
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around?
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
I called and called but you were out.  I thought I'd be gone before you got back.
He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so.
That bad, eh?
You know I'm a good person.
Don't forget your CDs.
Guess who I just saw, right by my store?  Ian.  In Starbuck's.  Neat, huh?
Pig died.
I'm sorry.
Look, are you coming or not?
Yes, of course.
Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate.
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
Oh, c'mon, Laura.  Just say something. Lie, if you want.  It'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better.
But what?
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
Hi.  What are you doing?
They'll go on early.  Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they can't play for more than a half hour.
That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
Yeah.  I just wanted to thank you for that message last night.  It made me feel like... like less of an asshole.
Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"
It's a crematorium.
Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place?  Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?
No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
Books, records, films -- these things matter.  Call me shallow but it's the damn truth, and by this measure I was having one of the best dates of my life.
Yes.  You?
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
So so.  Up and down.
I know what they're worth.  Give me fifty and get them out.
But you must have --
Eno import.  Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Break beats.  Serge Gainsbourg. Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett... What's going on here?  Are you guys stealing for other people now?
Jesus.  That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months!  Was it just your criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free.
We saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance fair.
Maybe he's hiding from something.
P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
I warned you.
Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
Scottish claymore.  Take a French epee, add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business, and you've got a claymore.
It's my birthday.
Would you like more tea?
Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house.
The boy _died_?
-Okay okay.
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-
Good reflexes.
Who?
Jesus Christ.
He tried to kill me last night.
You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time.
I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
You've been listening to rumors.
You did kill those men.
The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in.
Yes.
It's beautiful.
Yes.
I'm not even sure why.
A murder.
I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
What are you going to tell them?  That you're protecting a man who's killed four people?
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
Afternoon.
Aye.
You're not from these parts.
Why are you here?
In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
I don't understand.
Why does he want to kill me?
You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?
As they age they contribute to a sum that is the kindling from which all future life comes.  To feel it, to know it, is to be in touch with the will of every living thing.
It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength of _knowledge_.  The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be.
I am not ready for this.
You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.
That is not me.
But I did live.
David.
Complete your inspection?
You seem to understand a great deal.
Excuse me, "sir".  I thought we spoke as equals.
Help?  I've seen others "help". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter.
Here.  The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest.
Figure she's with him?
Should have seen him the first night.  Son of a bitch stood there with a quart of blood on his pant leg and didn't even blink.
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
He knows I'm here.  How?
Spare a chair?
Head still secure to the neck.
How did you find me?
The pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth.
Ah Steven, it is good to see you.
I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.
Yes sir.  When you get older your priorities change.  It's the simple things that count.  Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing.
Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.
I'm getting married tomorrow.
Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
Let him have everything he wants.  Now hustle and write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man.  He hides, cowering... Afraid of every light, of every sound... hears footsteps... his heart going like that... And all the time they're closing in... Get the sense of an animal at bay!
Oh, he's not the man for you. I can see that. But I sort of like him. Got a lot of charm.
Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?
But --
Yes, wasn't it?
Did you finish the interview?
Mr. Burns --
Mighty nice little town, Albany. They've got the State Capitol there, you know.
Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.
I feel I ought to take care of her.
Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
Get out!
No? Well --  Johnson, you're under arrest.  You, too, Burns.
I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense.  And you'll be an accessory!
I notice you still remember it.
Done what?
Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
What?!!
Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for?
You can break it, can't you?
You mean you're not coming back to work here?
All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!
Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack --
I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
Where'd you meet this man?
He's in the insurance business.
Thanks...
You're not afraid, are you?
Afraid? I should say not!
What for?
And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
You said it.
All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition.
It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
Not if he's inside the desk. We'll carry the desk over.  Give me Duffy!
How about the time he had his house painted by the Fire Department?
What tickets?
I'm finished.
What did you do with her?
I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?
Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
Thanks.
No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level!
Who do you want?
You got plenty of money?
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?
There's money in it, Cooley.
You said it!
Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.
It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
Are you gentlemen all through with me?
Hey!
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.
You ain't gettin' out o' here!
Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.
He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.
Read it! Insane, he says.  He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!
Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
All right. Tell 'em to shoot to kill.
Fine work, Pete! You certainly delivered the goods. I'm proud of you.
A sight for sore eyes!
You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that!
Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
Five hundred dollars.
Where's the old lady?
Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better.
There goes another scrub lady.
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
Did you get that, Hildy?
Look out, you --
Thanks. So long, Hildy!
Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?
You're not going to phone anybody where I am.
Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
This puts me in a peculiar hole.
Well -- Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's got to save the world. Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it. Well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him. But one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran's Parade and the cops chase him. He gets scared and goes into hiding.  Come in, Dave Schwartz.
Yes.
Bugger off.
You couldn't.
Tell them about Pauline's mum.
I suppose they're still learning, that's why they keep moving about.
Who with?
...and four and five...
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
Can't we just see the end?
It's like telling fibs.
What's that?
I don't know?
Why not?
You need trees for an avenue.
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
So you're going to be a grandfather.
Here's to music. And absent friends.
We all had to write a last letter home.
What's that?
We don't know anything about it
I've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, Clive. I never want to leave the river again. The children have had such a wonderful summer.
I won't have this vulgar talk in my house.
And where do you think you're going?
...such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers. All the punts lit up with Chinese lanterns. Like fireflies. And the gramophone going on one of the boats. Always the Charleston, the Charleston, the Charleston. Oh, you girls.
I can't do it. What's the point?
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.
God, how I hate all this scrimping and squalor.
What?
Drink up, it's party time.
Um, yeah sure, I guess.
No! He's one of God's creatures, he can't help it if he's dumb... I'm just crazy about animals.
What the hell are you laughing about?
What's this?
Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
Hell, boy there some other Duke you know about?  A great American.
No, no I think it's really interesting.
Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?
Holy crap. You gotta see this place. It's awesome.
Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
It's a hitchhiker.
Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.
Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us and our car to the nearest garage.
Should we stop?
There's not enough room.
Hey, he moved.
What!
Check this out.
Officers, officers what can I do for you today? I ain't fried up the birds yet... if that's what you're ring a ding dinging about.
And I gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... I figured what's the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.
Is that all... think real hard.
Yeah, yeah, sure. You don't have to get all True Grit all over my ass... I'll give'm to ya... you can knock yourself silly for all I care.
I always loved that mute broad that Chuck Heston was shacking up with.
That's nice.
Oh.
Ugh, what's that smell?
Fuck, it's freezing.
Oh, yeah.
So.
Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up.
Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
If I never eat at another Waffle House again, I can die a happy girl.
How long has it been?
Jesus Christ.
Recover any bodies?
That's the understatement of the year.
So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?
We hit the jackpot! Let's roll, good buddy. We got ourselves a convoy.
Oh, I get it... I guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween.
I suggest you kids leave now.
Where is he?
What are you doing?  ...no, stop... please, please.
Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.
Fuck, go to the car... call for backup. Tell 'em officer down.
Your Spidey senses tingling.
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
And?
Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off.
You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.
French?
Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?
Is everything fine?
Shall we close up, then?
It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
What is wrong, my darling?
Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?
What?
Well?
No!
Please let me go with you.
You'll thank me eventually, Puff. Well, you won't thank me, because we won't be speaking, but you'll sort of thank me with a special look, the look a dog gives you to let you know he loves you.
Shut up and tell me.
Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose.
God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.
I'm going to miss you.
I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to.
I hope you don't think me daft. It's important work. It's part of a larger sociological experiment. I'm federally funded.
What's the larger experiment?
Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.
I like you, too, Nathan.
I'm sorry about my parents.
Do you? Oh do you, darling?
Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow!
Shaving cream?
Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion?
Yes, darling.
He looks perfectly fine.
Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain. He's going to make me famous.
Your entire body?
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
No.
Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.
Such as my man and how to please him!  Such as making wonderful dinners for my man!  Such as looking pretty for my man!  And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal!
I had sold my fucking soul.
And what did you do tonight, honey?
I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did.
Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do.
Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
Mother?
I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
For what makes the world go round. For money, and for glory.
No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.
You bastard.
And the way you're looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you've just beaten? As if you'd just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride?
Could be.
Will you take a check, Bert?
The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
Bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
I like it. It's good for you. Besides, you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing. That's something you don't need -- an excuse for losing. How did you make out in the poker game?
You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.
Thinking about what?
How're the hands?
I know when to quit. You don't. Win or lose, you don't know when to quit.
You want me to tell her for you?
Tell her what?
Aaaahhhh!
Who's he?
Okay, I'm Eddie Felson. I shoot straight pool. You got any straight pool shooters in this here poolroom?
He's my partner.
Luck! Whaddya mean, luck?
Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.
Set 'em up again... C'mon, set 'em up again.
Fast and loose, man.
In the gut, I mean.
Now wait a minute. You're coming with me. You're gonna eat breakfast at the hotel. Pool game is over.
Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?
Twenty-five hours, Eddie. Twenty- five hours you been playin' straight.
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?
Oh yeah? Where?
Try me.
Have a nice trip.
Yeah? What do you do now?
I could always get us a bottle.
Okay. So what's your name today?
I got my things over at the hotel. I'll bring them over later...  Come here.
You want to go with me?
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
You going out?
Sarah, do you think I'm a loser?
Yeah. I met this guy -- Gordon, Bert Gordon. He said I was. Born loser.
Would he know?
Why did he tell you?
Sherry.  Very old, very dry.
Oh, grow up.
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
What do you want me to do? Just sit here and wait? Faithful little Sarah. Pull the shades down and sit. When you feel like coming back, you'll come back. And you'll love me. And then you'll go away again. Is that your idea of love?
I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
Fifty-seven.
Go on back to the hotel.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?
Do you remember where it is?
We don't know that --
It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much.
Do we have to?
I know, son.  But you'll like it where we're going.  I'm getting a good job.  It's a pretty part of the country.
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
I had an awful dream.
That's Ed.  Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.
I left it at work.
I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
Mr. Gardner, I don't think this is the place to discuss this matter.
How did it get Mrs. McKeltch?
Where, Jimmy?
When?
Ms. Magnuson, is Jimmy Gardner with you?
You're being paranoid.
All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
You saved a lot of lives.
Huh? Oh, good, good.
Can you believe this?
I'm thinking.
Three years.
I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook...
It's perfect the line is busy?
Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
Get on the horn with Atlantic Command. Let's upgrade the situation to DEFCON 3.
What?
I'm a dancer.
Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady.
Jimmy, kick it! They're gaining.
It's the wrong field, you idiot! Lucas' farm is on the other side of town.
Above American soil?
Mr. President?
Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!
Dad was onto something here!
Yes. Now we know.
Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!
Look what you did!
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before.
Let me tell you another "bedtime story," Doctor Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact.
My room!
Mine, too.
Knock it off. You're not mad.
This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
Then wait -- count to twenty.
Don't call me that, please.
No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
No! Don't Shoot!
Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.
What?
What?
Three devices of such lethal cunning.
Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
You left just when you were becoming interesting.
"Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass."
Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!
The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
You're strangely dressed... for a knight.
Get that camel out of the way!
I'll take the camels.
Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
Who are you?
Captain Blumburtt and his troops are here to check up on the "natives".
Well, Mr. Prime Minister, my report will duly note that we found nothing unusual here in Pankot.
Interested in local curios?
I would say you look rather lost.  But then I cannot imagine where in the world the three of you would look at home...
And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
Indy?
Indy, look!
Slow on the curves or we'll fly off the tracks!
Are you crazy, a lift raft?! We're not sinking, we're crashing!
Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now.
What?!
Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to crush me!
By the way, how'd you end up in Shanghai?
You're nice. Listen, I'm taking applications -- how'd you like to be my palace slave?
We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.
Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
WILLIE?!
Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them!
And they don't even know what it really is.
You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
I get it!
Don't do that.
Who?
Yes.
I just got here.
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
No.
What are you doing?
You're gonna explain.
Get your breathing down. You sound like a cement mixer.
I want out.
Did you hear that?
What do you mean we.
You gotta help.
Go out, take your first left.
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
Who did?
Oh my God...What did he look like, the man?
Like the guys that attacked us.
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
It's illegal.
I'll get in trouble.
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
Oh yeah, to what?
Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.
You eat it.
Why not?
What happened?
Yeah. I did it.
Mind your own business.
Which one is she?
I feel like an idiot.
What is it?
Joe! It's 56 hours!
She's got the most beautiful...s
You been had. We have.
Follow her.
Sapporo..
Where are you going?
You have to! Quickly!
Ow!
What was it? What'd I say?
It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong.
Holy...
I can always flush you down the toilet.
I'll get us out of here.
In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.
What are you doing?
I'm...scared.
Impossible.
How about a deal?
Surveillance Cameras?
Must be delayed effects of the drug... I'll get him out of here.
Bit expensive, sir.
That crazy guy?
That name's familiar.
And...you know Jan Gruner?
Who...are you?
Fine. You look fine.
We're here.
You'll feel better
What?
I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
Was quite excited, when he came in...
Yes...What is it?
Then who did?
Blake?
I waited for you.
Disinterest?
As if your mind's not all there.
That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?
You're doing...Okay.
To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
Why?
Your friends, did they ask about me?
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
You're leaving.
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
I don't know. He mentioned a city.
You don't believe me.
Oh sure.
Then why are you smiling like that?
Get us one.
I asked him.
Why'd you ask him.
You've  been there?
Why not?
What did you tell them?
They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
I'm sorry I got you into this.
Don't worry.
Just like that?
Kiss her you fool.
You are, I've seen you.
What about the others.
I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
It is?
I can't get it out. It would take hours.
Hi, honey.
What's new?
Where?
We'll give you a heads up before we launch.
Push it.
What do you mean, what's it do?
Get me Wigand.
Sure.
Maybe later.
Yeah, I heard rumors.
Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
What the hell are you doing?
A gun? Yes.
If this holds up, and it very well may not, Mike... but, if it did. And we aired this segment? And CBS was sued by Brown & Williamson? I think we could be at grave risk.
Hi, baby.
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
Yeah.
What?!
"I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60 Minutes.'" You know, you take the "60 Minutes" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call. Maybe Wigand's right. Maybe I'm hooked. What am I hooked on? The rush? "60 Minutes"? What the hell for? Infotainment. It's so fucking useless, all of it.
No, you do not.
Alright.
That's right...
It would be better if he called us.
Alright?
Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
I disappeared on you?
Oh, lots.
I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver.
...protect your sources...! You screwed me! You sold me out!
Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
And, I'm unemployed. So I have to protect my medical coverage.  ...so I left them a message this morning. Their expanded confidentiality agreement? I will sign it.
They're afraid of you, aren't they?
Seven dwarfs?
Hello. You there
Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
You charge by the hour?
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
I don't think you really understand --
No, don't evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or "60 Minutes'" with this cheap skepticism!
I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! And what are you puttin' up? You're puttin' up words!
What?!
What?
That's the whole point, Jeffrey. That's the whole point. Anyone's. Everyone's. They are gonna look under every rock, dig up every flaw, every mistake you've ever made. They are going to distort and exaggerate everything you've ever done, man. Don't you understand?
What does this have to do with my testimony?
I fought for you... and I still fight for you.
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
I can't say that!
There is -- there is no family.
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
Most certainly.
"I would bet on it."
It acts as a drug on the body?
Object to the form!
It acts as a...
Seven...
Okay.  I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
He --
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
I... uh guess congratulations are in order.
Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment.
She got absolutely nothing. Zero. Zip.
So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
What the hell is Botox?
He's the wrong man.
I'm happy for you, pal.
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
Marylin! What have I done?
Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
You said 'yes' didn't you?
-- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth. And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?
He's passionate.
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.
I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.
No. Don't stop.
Hmmm...
Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.
No ma'am. I have been asleep all my life up to this moment. Marylin, will you marry me?
Hi.
Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
I don't believe you have "things."
Those are gifts.
So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
Rex. Get away from the door.
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
I'm sorry. Where were we?
Forgery and Fraud?
You used his credit card.
So where are you now?
Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.
So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've never been the first wife. Rex was married before me.
Soon, you'll have your own rage!
Yes, I know Howard Doyle.
Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
That's delusional.
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
-- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?
Time marches on. Ardor cools.
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
I know that sounds rough but I'm about to close on a deal to develop some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged up to my ass. If this deal goes south, I'm ruined -- I'll lose millions.
She always looked out for me.
What are they?
HA!
Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.
Extinguish?
And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...?
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
We can't do the impossible, Mr. Andrews.
No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
OhMary
Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
The reward.
You're a peculiar chap.
We'll go into that some other time.
Do you love her?
Why don't you put me in chains?
I might.
You ought to know why. Because
Smart, aren't you! So subtle.
You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
I'll get it annulled.
What've you got against King Westley?
On the road.
Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?
Yes, I guess I have.  I don't want to hurt anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity. It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can't walk out on King now. It'll make us all look so ridiculous.  Besides, what difference does it make?  I'll never see Peter again.
If you really mean it, I will.
Why didn't you jam it down her throat?
We've done that already.
Yessir.  There's a report here from every State along the East coast. Want to hear them?
They're practically all the same, sir. 
No, thanks. We're not hungry.
Oh, yeah?
I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested.
What am I going to do now?
Don't be a fool. You lost your bag. The company'll make good. What's your name?
I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
I have an idiosyncrasy all my own. You'll notice my coat came firstthen the tiethen the shirtnow, according to Hoyle,[5] the pants should come next. But that's where I'm different.  go for the shoes first. After that I
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 
I can't go out like this.
Where is the shower?
Very outspoken, too. Said I looked funny. Wasn't that cute?
Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.
Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.
That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do?
Well, you were!
If you don't like it, you can resign from the company.
Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old womana trip like this.
What's the matter?
Not as long as I'm alive.
Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?
I wish you'd stop being playful.
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride
You're prejudiced.
What's the matter?
wasbut
But what!
There's no end to your accomplishments.
Amazing.
Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two.
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
You! Don't make me laugh.
Come on! come on! 
Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
That's swell!
Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love?
Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
Isn't he here?
But I don't go in for that kinda stuffmuch. I like to pick my fillies. Take you, for instance. You're my type. No kiddin' sister. I could go for you in a big way. "Fun-on-the-side Shapeley" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me. 
Up yonder. See the lights?
Mr. Gordon
Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
A thousand dollars!  Get out of this office before I throw you out bodily.
What's the thousand bucks for?
You!
Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.
Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with you.
Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?
They're married all right. I just seen the license.
Mush. Mush.
There you gotrustin' people again. How many times did I tell you
Looks like we're going to be stuck for a long time. 
Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need.
What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow?
SuresureI'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
Boss, Oswald impersonators?  Sounds like James Bond now.
The U.S. Attorney in Washington "declines" to serve our subpoena on Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell, CIA Director Richard Helms, or any FBI agent we named.
Right.
So you saw Oswald how many times?
Recall any names?
Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan.  Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia.  That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it.  As a direct result, the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.  I can't help thinking of that book Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn't want the Peace Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that.  It gets weirder.
You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
No, I'm not...
It's addressed to no one and no signature.  "To leave this life is, for me, a sweet prospect.  I find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand, everything that is loathsome."
The fact is he's gone, chief, and so's our case.
Shaw.  Clay Shaw.
Did he pay you for this?
Morning, boys.  Ready for a walking tour?
When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter.
That's gonna be tough.  Nobody's talking.
All right, all right.  Break it up.
No, I did not.
I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.
The Fontainbleau?  20 minutes?
Yeah.  Come on, Dave, come on our side.  I guarantee you the boss'll protect you...  Dave?
...give me protection?
What about the mob, Dave?  How do they figure in this?
Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?
But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds.
Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
Dave, can I just ask you this directly?  Did you ever work for the CIA?
Then who killed the President?
I had the cause of death.
There were admirals.
That's our case!
If that's your case, you didn't have a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.
...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
And Marina?  Does she have a problem getting out?
The next thing we know he's living in Dallas/Ft. Worth in October '62 working 6 months at Jaggars-Chiles- Stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the U.S. Army... He starts work only days before the government reveals Russian missiles in Cuba and the crisis explodes.  Oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works alongside a young man who'd been in the Army Security Agency.
Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
David Ferrie.
Mr. Shaw, did you ever meet Lee Harvey Oswald?
May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.
I've spent half my life in the United States military serving and defending this great country, Mr. Shaw, and you're the first person I ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president.
That's right.  When I saw him on TV, I was shocked.  I said to my family, "that was the man I saw in the truck."
Jim, come on, honey, get down on your hands and knees and hunt for Jasper's Easter egg.
Because when I scheduled it I didn't realize it was a holiday.  You were there, why didn't you say something?
I don't know what to say except I'm sorry.  I just don't have rabbits on my mind.
I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?"  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!
That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.
Damn it, if I say I'll spend more time with him, I'll spend more time with him.  I can't fight you and the world too, Liz.
Well so do I, goddammit!  So do I! I had a life too, y'know - I had a life, too.  But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!  It's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and "I'm jes fine honey."  While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies!  Well, I'm not "fine" about that, I'm angry. My life is fucked, Liz!  And yours is, too!  And if you don't want to support me I can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away.
I never doubted for a second that I was.  Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
Huh?
He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.
I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
Between six and seven seconds.
How many men?
General Charles Cabell.  Deputy Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a "traitor".  When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him?  Our friend Clay Shaw.
The Warren Commission call him?
I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your resignation.
I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator.
Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?
Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
Jim Garrison?
I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is another type of threat, I don't...
...and your General?
You never ask a spook a question. No point.  He'll never give you a straight answer.  General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.
...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.
Yeah!  That's it.  I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't.  I gotta go.
Sure sounds like he's winning.
Welcome, Mr. Miller.  Jim Garrison. Would you care for some coffee?
Where were you?  Europe, Pacific?
I know. That's why I went.
I need a favor.
We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there -- ten minutes.
Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --
Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus. L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in that bag?
This is your money?
My pocketbook.
What's this?
Take your time.
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
What did they want to know?
Same as you. Ten thousand.
You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn't mention the Federal.
I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit, so I never brought more than that.
What, I couldn't hear you?
I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair.
You never got into the whole CD revolution?
'76?
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
My ass ain't the same.
I walked right past you.
How was it?
Does it happen to all men?
Right around here, in the food court.
He's setting me up to make a proposition.
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
A half-a-million dollars will always be missed.
You do that?
Did you do it that night?
You're rationalizing.
Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
It never was, so I'm not gonna start worrying about it now. Look, Ray more or less believes my story, and he more or less doesn't care. All he really gives a shit about is getting Ordell.
He's already there.
I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement.
That's Ordell's.
I'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money.
You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them.
Yes'm.
You know what's in the bag you're taking?
What the fuck is that shit?
He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
How can you help us?
Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.
You talk to him?
White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
I'm sure that was the idea.
Uh-huh.
She didn't say.
You said that the last time.
You didn't count it?
You took the time to pay the saleswoman.
What did you do after that?
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
We had our agent on you. She sees a blonde come out of the fitting room carrying a Robinson's/May bag and tussle with a tough-looking white guy. The white guy takes the shopping bag and they go.
Do you think I took some of that money?
Buy ya a beer?
Sure.
How long you been with Ordell?
I put a little cherry on top. You're right. What the hell he ever do for us?
How you doing, Ms. Jackie?
I got some vodka in the freezer.
Well, then, why don't you be a good hostess and make me a screwdriver?
Yeah.
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.
I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all.
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
What does she think she's gettin?
Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?
She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
Is it ready to go?
Were you a disco girl?
So where did you go?
C'mon, don't lie.
I don't like dancing.
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
What do I do?
Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?
You're outside?
An employee I had to let go.
You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
I still don't understand why you keep her around.
You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where they got all them car dealerships. We're gonna leave this heap in a parking lot and get one the cops don't know about.  Hey, where's Melanie?
You couldn't just hit her?
Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
Then what?
Maybe the Feds got it.
If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.
That's why I never checked it. The bag felt right.
Hold on a minute.  Where you going?
How can I help you?
I got some more business for ya.
Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind.
You know who this is?
Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd already tried to get Jackie to go in with her, split the half million amongst themselves. What she did was take quite a risk to see you get your money.
And where's Jackie?
That's why she's givin' up my money huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie. I didn't trust her ass neither, but I knew how to handle her. She was my blonde-headed little surfer gal. I fuckin' told Louis he could've just given her a punch in the mouth, he didn't need to shoot her. She's at your office.
Uh-huh.
I know where it is.
Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes.
No problem.
Dream on!
Well, how do I look?
What do you want from me?
You know, you got a strange line here.
Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to you?  What's going on? How can you just turn away?  What about the others?
It was the window.
Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university?
Who's been talking to you? The army? Have they been talking to you, huh?
I talked to the Army's Bureau of Records. You've never even been to Viet Nam.
What'd he say that for? What made him say that? Strange, huh? Strange.
How long had that been going on?
Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.
Turn on your right side.  How about the other "right?"  I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
I thought you said she didn't say much.
God almighty. What did you do to me?
I had this weird flash just then.
Yeah. You. Every time I see you. No more Errol Flynn, okay? Your back won't take it. You tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what's good for you.
Louis, you're a life saver.
Are you in the service?
It's good to see you.
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
Jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, I might agree.  Tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she's living with?
Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist?
It's not healthy with it closed.
Jake, is that you?
I didn't want to wake you.
Where are you?
The room!
No. Have you seen my glasses?
Jezzie, I can't see.
Your kid dropped it off.
I don't let anybody call me that.
I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
What the hell are you doin'?
Get your clothes off.
You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die.
I know.
How come? The army?
Stay away from me, Jez.
I want to know. You tell me!
God, I can't keep up with all your changes.
I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go.
What's going on?
WHO ARE YOU?
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
You look upset.
Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
Where's West? New Jersey?
Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Shows how much you knew.
Right. They were worried. They figured you guys were too soft. They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? And we did it. The most powerful thing I ever saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my share, never compared to the fury of the Ladder.
I came up with the formula back in Nam but I never got a chance to use it.
What is it?
One drop?
It was paradise, Michael. You showed it to me. You were there.
Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back.
For what? For seeking the truth?
They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army.
I'm afraid to go by myself anymore. I keep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come up behind me. Somethin's wrong when a guy can't even take a leak by himself. I've seen 'em take people right off the street. I used to go home a different way every night. Now I can't even go home.
I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't ... Dr. Carlson died.
Do you want me to get someone?
Asshole that does not count as a kill.
Yes it does.
Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!
I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
You okay?!
Now what?
What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
Yuck.
You lost the charge?
They'll make it.
Now this is getting exciting.
You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?
Barbie from hell...
I'm surrounded by idiots.
Sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble.
I missed you too.
Yo, Teach, what the fuck?
Then open the doors!
I'm sending you the files.
We need to do some tests...I'd like to ask you a few questions.
That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.
I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
And incidental damages, if any...
And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
It's my charter. My party.
Why are we way out here, when the shark's back there?
Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow.
He's comin' up -- !
You going to be all right?
I don't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things.
There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor.
I'm going to hire Quint to kill the fish. I want to see that shark dead.
My kids were on that beach...
Who are you?
Drowning. Lemme ask you something. Is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water, around 10 feet from the beach?
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
It is a job. I'm not fooling around like some amateur. It's my life!
Don't they have lifejackets or something? An extra boat?
Why don't we just tow it in?
You here for the summer?
Twenty years.
I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
I just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off.
I don't need to pass basic seamanship.
Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut?  Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there -- a portable shower?
Whose idea was it?
We're getting a stretch limo.
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
Yeah, well... I still have your underwear.
Mine too.
Yup.
They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that?
Nails? Really?
Hon, did you get expelled?
Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now.
I'm a junior.
No, I mean in your pregnancy.
Yeah. Yeah! The way people used to do it. Quick and dirty, like ripping off a Band-Aid.
Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss.
Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds.
Oh. That's, uh, my room. Vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff.
Oh.
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here.
Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler?
I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
No, more commercial stuff.
Oh.
Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
Oh, is he bald and amorphous?
The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.
You know... it's parts...
I know what junk is.
It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was?
Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
Argento's good, but Lewis is completely demented. We're talking buckets of goo. Red corn syrup everywhere. And fake brains up the yin-yang.
This is even better than Suspiria. You've got decent taste in slasher movies, Mark.
God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?
I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.
I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point.
That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
What?
Oh, hi Juno. How are you?
Can I take your coats?
Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For, you know, the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right.
Damn skippy, you're not! You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds.
Yeah, she does.
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
You mean like couples?
Yeah, like people in love.
Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
I sort of already have.
Maybe you're having twins. Maybe your little boyfriend's got mutant sperms and he knocked you up twice!
I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
Unfortunately, yes.
When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
But then you'll get huge. Your chest is going to milktate. And you have to tell everyone you're pregnant.
Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.
A hotel?
Adele for god sake please lis...
Hi, I'm Adele.
What?
Can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? A lumpy mattress, that crummy TV and a crapper.
Thank you for what?  What are you thanking me for Adele?
Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?
Not so good. You sure you have to?
...Mind if I hold that Bible?
How much do I owe you?
By the way, I'm not much of a pool player.
...and?
Just being there where it really happened. It was different... more visceral.
...just like that?
So how's it going?
This mean your finally going to finish your thesis?
What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California.  "We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean."
Oh, yeah... He had a real thick accent right outta "Deliverance."  "Still? Who said anything about a still? Get ya ass up in them woods!"
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
Carrie.
All set?
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
I'm sorry, but I just can't see you veggin' out in LA-LA LAND.
Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little sleepy,... think Adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta.
...The police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. And no doubt God'll be pickin' on you on Judgement Day...
You be at this personnel office, Friday, three o'clock sharp.
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
Yes!
Oh shit. How long did it take?
You mean like fucking two virgins at once.
You wanna go to Paul's house?
I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
Probably.
78th.
Telly.
It is right.
Man, this guy is really good.
Yeah.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
I don't understand why you do that.
Holy shit man, your mom's got good titties.
How much you gonna take?
Casper! Was up kid?
Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
You goin'?
You sure?
I don't know. I just never seen girls that did that shit before. But I think it looks nice.
Sup. Sup.
Hey. What are you doin' right now?
Right now?
You know I've been thinking about you lately.
At the block party?
She won't? Why not?
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
Come on. It'll be fun. We'll just bug out. There should be a bunch of people. It'll be fun I promise.
I don't even want to talk, but I gotta tell you that when I first saw you last week, I, I couldn't stop thinking about you. You've been stuck in my head.
I just know. I know you'll love it.
This makes Special K look weak. It's a euphoric blockbuster.
Yeah.
I wouldn't believe it?
What?
No.
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
The pain. The fucking pain!
Right. You're like it's just this instinct. It's like this animal instinct is taking over you. It's like...
Like where are your erogenous zones?
Yeah. And you're not getting anything out of it.
I'm coming.
Just a lot of crazy shit.
I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.
You know... You know a lot of times sex gets in the way. Has that ever happened to you?
Right. You know it's not like... You know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!
Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...
Yep.
I've known the past of all the people I've fucked without a condom. Like I know one of the people got tested and was negative.
I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone.
It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
You want a wip-it?
That's the whole thing. You know if you look at it. I mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. And everyone's dying. And you better wear a condom or else. But the truth is. I don't know any kids with AIDS. No one I know has ever died from that shit. It's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes.
I can't man.
By yourself?
You are!  I don't like you.
What do you mean, no?
Then what's he talking about?
You're a lying bastard!
Yes you are.
What do you mean, stand out?
Very amateurish, Peter.  I'm surprised you would use such an obvious tactic.  I'm not an idiot!  Don't treat me as one!  I'll call you everyday... You get one minute, whether you put me on hold or talk is up to you!  Are you ready to play?
We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
You know her?
I know what I said!  She looks just like...
I'm just trying to play the game.
What?
You heard me.  Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
Last night was very exciting, wasn't it?  Have you figured out what I'm doing?
What word did you leave last night?
You sonofabitch!
Emotional?  I expected more from you.
Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
Sure.  We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.
No problem.  We're in.
Nope.  Nothing.
There's three.  The first is 1983. Lionel Baines.  The Boston...
What is it?
What scars?
Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.
You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
Why did he?
Not really.  It's pretty boring.
I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
That has nothing to do with it.
You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
This is where he forced his way in.  We found some fibers on the windowsill, probably particles of clothing that rubbed off when he climbed through. I'll know more once I get it under the microscope.
Well?
I'm busy right now.
His home would be... Mount Olympus.
Well, I think you have to play to his ego.  He thinks he's superior.  The more secure he feels, the more chances he'll take.
What time did he get there?
Ten days ago.
I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
Another one?  What word did he leave?
Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
Are we going to go through this again?
Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
I've got be here for the police when they come.  Then I've got to practise. In case you forgot I'm in the middle of a match right now.
You have something you want to say?
Just thought you might want to talk.
Thank you.  I'm at 639-7393.
Bainbridge Books.
What are they, please?
Sorry.  I thought it was empty.
Are you with the tournament?
Are you one of the players?
It's going to be a long night.  It could take hours before we know something.  You should try to eat.
It wasn't intentional.
Do you?
No.
Wasn't I just talking about me?
I'm sorry.
What is this?
You.
They're not delivering.  I'm going to go pick up the pizza.
A fierce magazine... brutal...  An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine...  fierce...  Mad.
It's not that easy.
Why?
Because I know what it says.
This isn't going to be like the phone book, is it?
You beat him.
I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.
Hello, Peter.  You played an interesting game last night.  Even though sacrificing your Queen at b-5 is the game I played against Valsney in '82.  I'm glad it helped you.
I'm sure you are.
I'm not nervous.
Well, you're beautiful.
Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
Lyssa ...
I don't know how.
You will go alone.
I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
Reach out farther. Call to her.
You have not slept in two days.
I cannot reach her.
The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here?
He has come for Lyssa.
They will hold Lyssa in the Center of the Vortex, the place of the Beast, where its power is greatest. No man can match it there. Lyssa must try to move toward us. For as we enter the Vortex and move closer ...
She can see the Beast!
Slayers!
I know the cruelty of such a fate.
Even by you?
Let me comfort you.
I don't think you'll grow careless.
Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?
That I promise you.
Go. I command you.
We could reach it on fire-mares.
Subject to the King, no doubt.
Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
Sugarballs?
I don't think it's working.
Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
And do you think I live on air?
Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.
Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help.
A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you.
It will not help.
She told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!
Well, I don't need them...
The fat man down there, on the bench.
Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.
Come on, get down!
Why don't you take me with you?... I'm ready, now.  You said I learn very quickly.
Well... Then may you rent me your gear for the day?
Stop. Everyone is looking.
What?
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
...I don't know.
...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?
Yes.
May I ask you a personal question?
Mathilda, listen!
Huh? That's smart!
Yeah, true.  But what does your father exactly do for living?
Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
You can't sit here like that.
...And how much is it?
Is he still alive?
Yes... Twice.
How long does this... Mania last?
Mine.
Are you a preacher?
Can it kill me?
You have?
It's a tremendous amount of work -- moving.
What it is -- is the truth.
Anything?
Ellen, there are two kinds of people in the world --
Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway.
Where?
From where?
Why?
I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.
It's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadman's house.
You tell stories?
There was a boy named Isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself -- waiting... He went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove.
They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening.
Ellen told me that she didn't know if I loved her.
Adelle told me, your writing is going well.  The Crusader for social issues and all.
You look so happy -- how long have you been married?
Where did he go?
Sparkling apple cider?
I'm sort of curious... if you're willing to pay me two-fifty... not that I mind... I mean, I'm OK with that -- why aren't you staying in a hotel?
What's the story? Are you too drunk to come?
I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow.
Don't run away.
I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you.
You OK?
Is that really what you want to ask me?
Sera...
So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
Why?
Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
Please!
How'd this happen?
Where have you been staying?
Yes, but your major is Fashion Merchandising. Harvard won't be impressed that you aced "History of Lycra". What are your backups?
I can't tell you.
I loved him!
You're fired. I have new representation.
How many, would you say?
Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down?
Because they got wet.
Dewey Newcomb?
Huh?
So everything you just said --
Donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.
Yes?
I think so...
No!
Is she?
You ready?
Great. Donovan actually said the words "Good work, Ms. Woods". He takes me seriously! Can you believe it?
Uh -- family.
I know. I thought that was very -- classy of you.
I don't know! Everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more --  Serious!
But isn't it kind of hard to get into law school?
Speaking of which, can you please put on some party clothes? You look like someone rolled you in something sticky and dragged you through a K- Mart.
Donovan, Royalton and Levinson.
Why?
And you know this for a fact?
Back up. How do you know he's gay?
Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.
So now you're -- ?
I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
Calvin Klein's spring line is atrocious. Don't you agree?
Neither.
Why not?
You're beautiful.
But the thing is, if I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm thirty -- I can't keep dicking around.
I told you, Elle. I need someone -- serious.
If you tell him, you'll probably make summer associate. Who cares about Brooke? Think about yourself.
It made me realize something. I'm an idiot.
And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham?
I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney.  Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it.
Why?!
There he is!
Why so few?
Birdies... pretty...
This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress.
Your words sting more sharply than your whip.
Not from me, surely...
You... you're a beast!
Like some vile toadstool.
When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself!
Jack... Oh, Jack... Help me...
I can keep a victim alive for weeks... months, if I desire it... it's an art.  They beg for death... I keep it just out of their reach.  The pain remains constant.
Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.
What was that?  Did you hear that?
It sounded like it came from the courtyard.
You come stealee tleasoo?
Honeythorn Gump, is it?  I've not seen your ugly face since you sold me a jug of cow piss claiming it was dragon's tears.
We be honored, friend Ogg.
Damnation!  Codfish and cockles! Gammon and trotters!  You've bested me, Jack.
I'm honored, Honeythorn Gump... but no more tricks.
It looks... er, delicious...  Such a fine bouquet... very aromatic...
But... but, why?
Are we here?
Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
There it be, lad.  The Lindfarne Mound.  Kings long forgotten lie there, lost in their final sleep.
I believe this is a sword such as the archangels wield.  Surely St. Michael had so fine a blade when he drove the serpent from heaven.
Pregnant, is she?
We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
A true and troubling question, Gump... We'll start from where the unicorn was killed.  The Baron must have left a trail.
Blackheart?
I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.
I should hope not!
Make haste!  We've a hard day's march ahead.
... this rate... we'll all be in our graves... 'fore we reach the Baron's fortress...
What make ye of that, Jack?
Archers!  Bring down that spider! I'll deal with this other creature...
Wait, Jack.
Don't like the feel of it, Jack.
Why not mine the damned walls?
Easily spoken...
Been telling you that all along, lad.
Faerie magic's no match for a sorcerer's power... We have Ogg's gifts, the key and the --
Jack!  The courtyard's been taken... The Baron's forces are besieged in the south tower.  No sign of... Jack?  Do you hear what I'm saying? We've won, lad.
Can you save her?
The Baron hides in the dark in a passage under the Castle... Quick, give me the dwarf's key... the one which opens any lock...
What weapon?
I've not heard a note out of you.
Sweet slippers of Oisin!
Unicorn?
He did run?
Not even the birds sing sweet as you.
If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  Do you wish to marry me, Jack?
Tis not fit for a princess.
No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
In the dark... where I join him...
No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!
Pinching?  Where?
Grand champion, is it?  And what great cause leads you to me?
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
Princess Lili, Godwin's daughter. She was with me when calamity struck, but after I could find no trace of her.
No!
Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
That was in jest.
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
And as barren of love as stone.
What's she doing?
What can you steal from a man already lost his life?
To Castle Couer de Noir?
It be the castle... we feel the castle... it be that close...
A castle's but stone and mortar --
What's that for?
So put your plans of my room in the trash.
Mom?
I couldn't sleep last night.
Are you his friend?
Why?
Alyssa.
Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
My keys.
I'm hungry!  Where's my dinner?  Who ate my dinner?  Huh?  Who's in trouble now?
Why?
Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride?  Maybe see a movie?
Does everything have to have a point?
I thought I was helping you.
It would help me if I could kiss you.
What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality.  I mean, I hope I'm not the first to say that about you.
You hate your father.
Floating to Catalina.
If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
He won't leave my room.
Will he talk to me?
We've known each other since grade school.
Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop.
Oh, yes.
After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
What are you on?
how much weight have you lost?
Oh...nothing.  Thirty pounds.  I just haven't been very hungry.
How's your wife?
I've been here twenty years.
How old are you?
Oh, well...those are...I mean, we don't get to keep our work.  I could maybe ask them if you could choose one.  But, you know, frankly George, you were the best. Computer models can't begin to match the beauty you gave yours.  They're a part of this firm.  They inspire me.  I go out there and sometimes just stare at something I've designed.  It amazes me. I would miss that too much.  Look, I may be going out on a limb, but you go out there and look them over, every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you. Just run it by me first, just in case, you know...but I'm sure it'll be okay.
Sam?
I didn't recognize you!
I did warn you.
Because I live there.
Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.
No.
It bugs me.
I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some money.
And I don't take a shower in the middle of the yard.
Where are you going?
Where is it?
I'll have to pay him back.
I took some of your Vicodin.
I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left.
We're all dying from the start.  I just got picked for Advanced Placement.
You lied to me!
What would you do?
I'm sorry, I don't know what that was.
It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot.  I didn't write him up...told him I wouldn't tell you...
Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day?
Why would they tow your truck?
Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.
I want him with me.
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George.
What did I say?
You bit my finger.
Back.  Neck.  Back.
Are you going to kiss me?
I better get the kids home.
What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
I'm helping George build his house.
What?
You can't go because of Sam?
You could keep it and rent it out?
Why?
Adam, that's not true!
I'm talking about a haircut.
Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.
Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
Married?
But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
I apologize, Claude. That was rude of me.
Cool it, Ray. You're gonna get us in a lot of trouble.
Sure, boss.
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
What?
At some point a man's got to get serious about his future. I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking about.
My daddy is dead so watch your mouth. You can say what you want about me, but don't be dragging my daddy into it. This watch means the world to me. Solid gold. Keeps perfect time.
Guess we better get going, huh?
No, man. I want you to have it.
So?
That's why we won't take the train. Cookie showed me where there's a farm house. They got a boat there.
What I know about boats is they take you to freedom. Come on, man. I think we can do this.
Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.
Give me back that hot dog. I'll eat it myself.
Him?
It's amazing what Ray here can do with a couple of pounds of potato skins and some molasses.
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
After all these years of blissful silence, I almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be.
Wilkins' driver's got the flu, so he asked me to fill in for him.
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
You ain't getting out of that trunk.
This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
Don't make me take them away from you.
Don't shoot, sir. I can deal with this.  Ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot this white man. See, you do that, they'll kill you for sure. And it's not that I like you or anything, but I've kinda gotten used to having you around.
I said you're soft.
Over to the morgue and up the hill to the cemetery. Never thought I'd admit it, Claude, but you were right.
How you doin'?
You ever done time before?
What is that?
Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
Ray, my man, this steak is like butter!
Too hot, huh? Well, you tell that lazy jiggaboo the state of Mississippi ain't interested in his meteorological assessments.
I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
Is everyone here?
Wait for the firemen!
Lemonade?
You don't have to twist my arm.  Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.
I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean.
Apparently, your sister died.
Hey, Ray, what's the name of that nightclub of yours?
Me? Willie Long.
What are you in for, Willie?
You shouldn't have come here.
He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
Oh, Nicky, I've missed you. Come on out and say hello...
Urr... uggg... errr...
An angel?
Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back...  Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye.  That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi."
Oh my God, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.
So far, so good. Now what?
From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
But those are my roommate's sodas...
Release the evil?
This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
So go get 'em, Dad!
I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
It's Stanley, sir.
Boogerland!
Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock.
You were gone ten seconds. What happened?
No wonder your uncle's so weird...
Hello.
It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
What was that?
Hey.
Nicky!
Do me.
Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
It looks like the work of a brother...
A black guy?
I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.
Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go!
All right -- what are you?
Where do you send them?
Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's --
Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
How did they get in here?
Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
What other food?
Just the face.
Do you have anything special in mind?
You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor... Logan-6.
Anybody we know?
No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
Why aren't you in Nursery?
Well then...?
He was killed.
You felt sad. What's your name?
Jessica.
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
Later.
No.
I thought I had to do something.
Curious.
Let's have sex.  I thought you were curious.
Why is it wrong to run?
I suppose. But what if you want to live?
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
Where did you get that?
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.
Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman:  We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral.
Some people say children need human mothering.
How will they know we're coming?
How do we know this is the right way?
Some kind of breeding pens... I suppose... They say people used to breed animals, fish, anything...  ...to eat, of course.
I hate outside! I hate it!
Don't!
...But I still have the choice...?
Look at his face... and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old?
We can't. We're going back.
"Beloved son"...  So people stayed together for that feeling of love... They would live and raise children together and be remembered.  I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we be that way?
Beloved husband...
And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
Hello, Sandman.
What kind of place is this?
Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
We're leaving.
That's better than gold when it's cold.
Thank you.  Tell me -- what do those words mean? "Beloved husband"... "Beloved son"... "Beloved wife"...
Pete... You okay?
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
Sure.
Me, too.
Hello.
I don't know.
How'd it happen, Alice?
Where's the bathroom?
I don't know his name. He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think.
What night is that?
Hey.
The police called us.
His condition? What do you mean?
Where's Pete?
Out in back.
You talk to him?
We saw you that night, Pete.
You just gonna let him go?
That's not Fred Madison?
You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
Something wrong?
What are you going to do?
I like to laugh, Fred.
I had a dream about you last night...
Don't you want to watch it?
We've got to call the police.
What was that?!!!
Let's go home.
Was there?
Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! 
Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
Last time I saw you.
What else about that night?... Did anything happen?
Sheila...
YOU'RE SORRY!!
Found in Asia!
Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
I didn't care for 'sister' last night, and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.
I see.
I see.
Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
Oh, really?
Yes.
He might have lost his way.
That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had.
So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
They were in a quandary, and
Come on, Lovey.
Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!
Well - I'm
I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business
Goodness, no!
How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?
Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
They were.
Centuries.
Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?
That would suit me perfectly. I'm always broke. How did you pay for them?
When was all this?
Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.
Charming, isn't she?
Young? She arrived here in 1888. She was 20 at the time. She was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. The whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people.
Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do.
Of course, the porters will be very well paid - that is, within reason.
You know, it's very, very strange, but when you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you. I bring the most amazing news.  The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr. Conway.
Amazing, Mr. Chang. This place is amazing! And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. Oh, I've looked around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy.
Father Perrault is dead.
Are you taking me?
No, I can't! I can't! You've got to let me rest! You've got to let me rest!
Are you the High Lama?
We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on.
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
Yes.
Just what I needed too.
Yes.
Of course you would. If ever we get out of this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen's father.
You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something wrong with you, let me help you.
Oh, George . . .
Why not?
Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
This would be funny - if it wasn't so pathetic. Why, she isn't a day over twenty!
You're wrong, George.
The clothes?
was saying
I guess we're in for it.
You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
Oh, please. I hope you're not going to run away this time.
A man whose life was empty!
Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.
What do you want him to do?
I'll make some for you!  You will come today?
Perhaps.
Cowan--
So... this door.  It's... not an exit...  ?
I guess I lost:
It's easy.  You work your way up the secret service, one day stand with the President, meet the most important people on the planet, fulfill your dreams, live happily ever after.
Sir.  I thought those records were sealed.
It'll make sense later?
I'd go with number three.
'Hell, I may as well do something useful.
I'm just saying it was cold.  I think she kind of liked me.
Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
Now what?
He's a slimy little slithering scumwad is what he is.
I dunno. Why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner?.
The radio show?
Jesus Christ...
"Perhaps we shoulld take a lesson from our dinosaurs..."
I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
What are you doing?
You were saying?
Yeah.  His dream and our worst nightmare.
Or when someone has a hideous birthmark and all you do is stare.  I really like that.  Let the other girls have the guys like you. Chiseled jaw, perfect nose, quirky dimples.  I find you all so boring.
So... how'd you hear about this?
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
What is it?
Okay.  If you've got a bug problem-a big one.  And they're swarming and there's no way to shoot them all individually... how do you get rid of them?
I don't believe you, Mikey.  And you know why I don't believe you? Cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon.
... recent landings within a hundred mile radius of Sudbury, Virginia?
Found it.
He's gone, too.
As far as I can tell, the guy's what he says he is - alone, and unarmed.  All he wants is five minutes to introduce himself to the public.
If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?
Is it now?
Drop some money.
Please, I want to go back...
Where are we going?
The other two will die without me.
-- but he didn't.
Found?  Where?
About who?
Yeah --
We know each other?
You're part of my flock now, John. Welcome.
Lara called me.
Justice already knows.  Talk to me, John.  Tell me what's happening?
I can't.  They're following me right now.  They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.
Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.
I show time of occurrence, Friday at fifteen-zero-six hours.
I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
But it's not the future if you stop it.  Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
To them.
You set me up...
You gonna tell on me?
I can't touch you!  And John, you can't be in here!  You'll confuse them!
I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...
Detective.  Nice of you to come down here.  Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now.  Jesus, what's up with your eye?
I need your help.
I'm impressed, Anderton.  You're on the lam, but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.
No.  No way.  I wouldn't even know where to begin!  Those thoughts about my cousin Elena -- they were just thoughts. I would never --
Sean -- you're not real.
Wanna hear something funny?
You're alive?
Who are you?
... and that I needed his help.  It wasn't so bad really.  I sang him a song, made him laugh, bought him a pretzel.  I took care of him.  I made him happy.
What?
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
I'm not gonna kill anybody.
You said they're destroyed.
John?
Then how did he --
Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
The guy from USA Today is here.
The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
Good God.  What was that?
According to the Sentry, Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.
Near Death's real popular right now, which includes everything from getting hit by a car, to falling off a high building to plane crashes.  It's a big rush, you come out the other side without a heart attack.
Can't they shut that off?
There's thousands of units like this one.
What kind of cop were you before this?
How many?
That's why you asked to partner with me on this little sortie, isn't it?
People, if you don't let the spyder scan you, we'll have to come in and arrest you.
John Anderton was my friend!
The man across the street.  I've seen him before...
I haven't seen him in two years.
What does he want with a precog?
Wally, the other two can still function, right?
What are you talking about?
He'll be a minute, hon. You want some coffee?
No thank you.
What's 'incidentals?'
Is it the good room?
All the suites are about the same.
Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
Manhattan.
He's okay.
And how could you fucking leave Horrace hanging?
What's wrong, baby?
You're not my daddy.
You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti
Mommy's not home?
Who's watching the baby?
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin.
What'd you say?
Your dance is over.
What's that?
A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
Pshhh...
I got a way we make everybody happy.
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
There won't be a next thing.
Hi. I, uh, think that's us.
You're going to the Soho Grand hotel, right?
Where is the Soho Grand?
You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to Max.
So, it's not a winning record.
Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
I'll page you.
He didn't say we need guns.
Fuck him.
What are we delivering?
I like it.
It's not even yours.
Nice work.
C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
Shit. No new pages. I don't even know where the fuck we're supposed to go.
You sure?
What are you doing?
How'd they know who you were?
No. They asked who I was, then told me what corner.
I mean, that's what I heard --
Missing what? He didn't say shit.
Yeah.
Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is?
What are you doing.
Nothing, man.
The what?
Calm down.
It's gonna be fine.
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
Fine, fine. And you were...?
Bobby and Ricky.
C'mon...
I don't wear a white wig, I don't carry a gavel.
Watch out, man. Sorry. I'm on the list, man.  Hey, bro.
What?
Yes.  Would you care for another one?
Where's Spa.
How do you know it's not drugs?
You strapped?
Stop.
I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
A lot of Persians?
Can I borrow a piece of --
We're going to New York?
That money is your per diem.
Keys.
Well, that's news to me. The name's Tom.
Edinburgh.
Well, word on the street is you're Welsh.
Dip?
Heard where?
Man's rep travels.
YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
When?
I told you less paper, less trouble.
Ain't nuthin' in the world to give you that real deep cool. Like girl. You there?
I'll give you back the 600.
Take it easy, baby.
Yeah.
Yeah, got to do something about you.
Don't push it. You way ahead. You back on top. That boy loves you, man.
Okay, okay.
Come on, daddy, pull my coat. What happens if you give all that up? You get sick or somethin'? I pulled a hustle once and got out of the draft.
You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out.
Aardvark, noun. An earth pig; an ant- eating African mammal. Man, that sounds like the dozens.
Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood.
You pitch, baby; I'll ketch.
I'm not Malcolm Little and I'm not Satan.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
Tell Him that.
I don't know how.
You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
We need more young warriors like yourself, stick around and we shall see if your heart is true.
Next week, Brother Minister.
I can handle it.
No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one. Tell me something: how tall are you?
It won't be easy.
It will be rough.
Talk about what?
There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?
Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
What do you want me to do?
Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
Dear heart, where are you?
I wish you'd listen to us. What about the meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people.
As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.
Just what is your question?
Now just a moment, just a moment --
Just what are you saying?
Please, go ahead.
If you want to tell me.
If I surprise you, let me explain. Menial work teaches us humility.
Can I ask you something?
Sure, man.
"His greatest greatness."
And like a fool I believe it.
Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.
I know where you're going.
500.
How long has this been going on?
Let me die then.
You evil this morning.
Hey, man, gimme some skin.
The hell you are.
I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna be Bogart sometimes.
I ain't doing bad.
Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind.
I'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one.
Your turn, Rudy. You want me to flip for you?
He told you that?
This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him like a brother.
I traced the PIN. I have an address for you. But I need to see you.
[We page him and he calls back on this cell phone.]
[Who pays you?]
[The what?]
[Four-seven-four-seven.]
[What money?]
[Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]
[The cops call him 'The Dreamer'.]
[I don't know, I swear.]
[I don't know him. I saw the opportunity and got lucky.]
[O.K. So tell me more.]
[There was no ten million dollars.]
[Maybe your men stole from you.]
I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?
You got a secondary search and you had a gun.
How long you staying, Crease?
There's still ink on my fingers from last week.
I've heard of it. Never happened to me though. Maybe the firing pin's off.
Fuck. Look at you; you won't last a day the shape you're in. Unless you stop bleeding you should have your spleen removed.
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
Potential? I don't understand.
What are you doing?
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
It hurts.
Yes.
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
You don't flinch when a gun goes off; you react. You go. Don't listen for the sound; don't anticipate it. Concentrate on the sound itself.
I dropped her at home.
The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.
The gunshot holds no fear.
I'm tough, Creasy. I'm tough as you.
You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.
Then be trained.
Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
Rosanna Guerrero.
Where are you?
The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later.  His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass.
If she pisses you off, you get another one.
Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day.
Bye, Mom.
And bankruptcy. Where will that put me in the social strata?
Our child's safety is at stake.
My wife, Mr. Creasy.
Hmm?
I've just been so busy, Lisa.
It will be a hard break.
[Then what do you have to lose?]
[When you talked to him, did he look sane?]
Pollo Pibil. Chicken and chorizo sausage. Hmmmh. They marinate it in lemon and orange juice. It's a stew really.
You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.
Light. At the end of a long, dark tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again.
And they took that away.
You wanna have a drink before we start dancing?
My old lady, every word outta her mouth, when you gonna get married?
I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
All right, I'll see you!
Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. I introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. Now, why did you do that?
Hello, Lou, Angie come in yet?
It's her baby too, you know.
Ah?
This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
I'm twenty-nine years old. How old are you?
...you teach chemistry? That's funny. Where? What school?
I think you're kidding yourself, Clara. I used to think about moving out, you know? And that's what I used to say. "My mother needs me." But when you really get down to it, that ain't it at all. Actually, you need your father. You know what I mean? You're living at home, and you got your father and mother there, and you can go on like that -- being a little girl all your life.
I'm afraid of being lonely.
Siddown, take off your coat. You want something to eat? We gotta whole half-chicken in the icebox.
No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.
No...
Nothing.
So I'll call you tomorrow.
Goodnight, Mrs. Pilletti.
Well, I'll tell you. I got stuck on a blind date with a dog, and I just met an old girl I used to know, and I was wondering how I'm gonna get rid of the girl I'm with. Somebody to take her home, you know what I mean? I'd be glad to pay you five bucks if you take her home for me.
No, I'm not kidding.
You gonna get married.
Sooner or later, there comes a point in a man's life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact I gotta face is that whatever it is that women like, I ain't got it. I chased enough girls in my life. I went to enough dances. I got hurt enough. I don't wanna get hurt no more. I just called a girl just now, and I got a real brush-off, boy. I figured I was past the point of being hurt, but that hurt. Some stupid woman who I didn't even wanna call up. She gave me the brush. I don't wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like I was a bug. I got feelings, you know. I had enough pain. No, thank you.
So I'll die without a son.
Hello, Marty, when you come home?
Did you offer the young lady some fruit?
She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?
What nurses?
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
Hello, Ralph. How'd you make out with those nurses last night, Ralph?
I just wanna thank you people again, because the situation was just becoming impossible.
On accounta...
There's sort of a built-in prayer for the sick man to get well, but of course that's not the basic intention.
You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
Stop him! Stop that man!
I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
I don't believe it's right for you to involve a boy who's not seventeen years old yet...
My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
Well, there it is. Jesus!
Now that's what I call real pretty. We can close up here and go into his belly.
And you've had a natural four times in a row in a crap game. Right? Does that mean...?
Hail to the chief! We-all got a responsibility, men. He's crowned like a king ought to be, but he can't just walk to the Mess Hall by himself. He has to be carried by native bearers.
How come nobody knows about him? And you do?
Give us this day our daily...
Pierce! That soldier requires immediate attention. I'm a surgeon and I know.
A-negative. I've cross-matched it.
What are they peeking at? Captain Waldowski in the shower?
Black capsule.
I don't feel anything.
I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
What do we do?
But he's got five times the man-power to draw on.
Captain, I've been observing the nurses on your shift. But naturally your own opinion is more informed than mine.
On the contrary, I've observed he's not only a good technical surgeon, he's a good military surgeon. And that includes how a man dresses and how he bears himself and his sense of what it means to be an officer in the United States Army.
It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
What's the matter?
Thank you, Captain Pierce.  It's been so long.
No trouble at all.  Hawkeye.
It isn't always this rough?
Our minds?
How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
What did you have to test, for God's sake... the dental Don Juan of Detroit?
No, never in the slightest.
That's really what I came here for. See what you guys recommend.
In the direction you want to go.
How much time do I have?
Good morning, Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest.
There ought to be a law against dentists reading. Matter of fact, I thought there was. Anyway, this is an obsession. He can't be persuaded out of it.
If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! Tell Major Burns...
If I can make a suggestion, Coach.
Well, there's one big satisfaction.
As long as there's a pile-up, we can do our bit to encourage his permanent withdrawal from the contest.
Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column.
Huh?
Action?
Can't. I'm feeling too good.
Yeah. No, no!  No! No, look. You don't have to smell the world! 
You got me.
Of course not. He wouldn't be.
Uh-huh . . .
Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.
Me?
You know, I had a crazy dream last night. It was about you.
Ted Sheldon.
All set, Ann?
Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
A deal?
Well, you're catching on.
Hurry up, Pop.
Well, maybe you're right.
Yeah, but it's got everybody sore. Ads are being pulledthe Governor's starting a libel suitwhat's more, they all know John Doe's a phoneyand they insist on seeing him.
Now listen, Annhe can't possibly get in without our seeing him. I'm watching the side door and the Colonel's out front, so stop worrying.
No.
St-rike!
Yeah. That'sthat's him. Of course, you don't know Grubbel, but he's the man that everybody figured was the worst no-account in the neighborhood because he was living like a hermit and nobody'd have anything to do with him. Er, that is until Murphy, the postman told us the truth. "Why, Grubbel," he says, "he lives out of garbage cans because he won't take charity. Because it'd ruin his self-respect," he says.
Well, anyway, II guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. "If you ask me," he says, "they're starving."
Sure. I remember . . . Say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? Mine did.
You win, Colonel. Here's the fifty. Go on out and get rid of it.
Four bits.
Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. They can't use the John Doe Clubs for politics. That's the main idea.
Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for
Huh? Get what?
Show me an American who can keep his mouth shut andI'll eat him.
Let go of me!  This man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building! He was paid to say so!  Do you deny that?
No, I didn't write it, but
Ah, you bet your life you didn't! You look in your papers, ladies and gentlemen, and you'll find Miss Mitchell's signed confession that she was the one that wrote it!
Flowers.
No, she just left. I'm surprised you didn't run into her. She went over to Mr. Norton's house.
Thanks. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.
Uh-huh.
Is there a crowd in the street?
I don't know.
Mind if we make a stop on the way? We busted Frank Antonucci on possession. He gave us a lead on that Polk Street jewelry heist.
This SWAT guy might be a good idea. He may be able to take a little pressure off you. I worry about you.
You want me to go up with you?
God damn it! I still needed to case that fucking store. It's too risky to show my face now.
You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you.
The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie.
You signed out twice.
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor?
I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there.
That's not going to look too good on your service record.
Only at the very end.
I've rarely shot anyone.
SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
National Marksman Competition.
You living together?
Explain how that works.
She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married.
Around. Barnett's tough competition.
Lesson two, "Dead Eye"... should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage.
Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.
So what do you want?... An autograph.
Still needs work.
How long you been coming here?
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.
Ray, if you walk out of here with me, I'll get you a job.
Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
You worship yourself.
Greg.
Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
I wanted to get this out of the way.
That kind with the garlic and the oil that I like so much?
Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
Hmm?
You talkin' about gettin' 'nekked?'  Shit, I thought you were talkin' bout, you know... the "M" word.
The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress...
Who's running it!
What do we got?
We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself "Joe". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for.
Yeah, they are but...
What do you need?
Why --
You don't have much sex up there in the real world, do you?
The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.
Not my problem.
-- Two million people plugged-in here.
You sure he's going to come?
Doesn't make sense.  How the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us --
Because why the hell would you be interested in a program that allows people to live inside your machines?  I mean how much profit could there possibly be from owning the universe and selling space in it to people who are dying, or people who are just God-Damned sick of this world --
A hotel?
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
We drugged her.  So she wouldn't remember.
Try harder.
-- You told me.
-- The inside?
Identical.  One's you.  One's digital.
And it meant something.
I wasn't with you.
But you were with me.
I'm sorry.
Sorry?!
It was just there.
Program name?
Standard, modern, upscale --
Program name?
Access established.
He's on us!!
It's passing over earth as we speak!  Trajectory coordinates are 009843.
Alpha.  Is there any way we can defeat this  monster?  Any way at all?
Rangers...  I'm afraid you're too late.
He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.
Aisha, you are the Bear, stalwart and bold.
SABER TOOTH TIGER!
It is said that to those who possess the Power... all things are possible.
... Nothing.
The Stealth Eagle is about to fly.
Here you go!  No pushing!
Hey, boss!
Taking over the world is one thing.  It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer.
You've got the public upset, Al.
But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.
Up here, Boss.
That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
I ain't mad. I ain't even surprised. But I can't let ya fuck me. On the other hand, if ya got needs beyond the thirty-five, I'll advance it to you against our next deal on the same terms.
Lad, I'm a busy man. July's always a big month for murder. Fella named Barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear.  Black Hand.
You got men on Profaci's place?
No disrespect, Tommy, but why would Mr. Arnold Rothstein wanna do business with bums like us?
Luciano.
It's a mask.
I booked passage to London.
Would it be painful for you?
Bugsy, you and I don't need to be in business with Maranzano. We got more jobs than we can handle. That's not the problem.
We're going to Atlantic City for the honeymoon.
I been thinkin'...
Come off it, Bugs.
We got exactly two choices, Maranzano or Masseria.
You boys carryin' pieces?
Where we headed?
Boss, I got all the time you need.
MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT!
You gotta plan these things.
Good liquor draws a good crowd.
He's an animal!
And the Jews?
Tell me, my son. Why did you go with Giuseppe? He's not our kind.
And if I had known, I would have warned you to expect this. We could have prepared.
Know somethin'? This stuff's just kick-the-can on ponies.
Special occasion?
Jesus, honey...he always joked about you <u>curing</u> him, but I never realized what you cured him <u>from</u>.
"4/17: Subject, when unaware of observation, prefers to hold eating utensils...with feet. Successfully carves turkey roll holding eating utensils...with feet."
Olive or eyeball?
I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.
Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
Back? You're sending me back?
Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand.
I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
Tell me what?
Now Death is not what you would call a people person, like me. Death is a <u>putz</u> - and I should know. I'm his little brother.
NO! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?? HE'S GOT MY E-TICKET! HE'S GOT MY -
And speaking of which, here's the light of my life, the pert and saucy Miss Julie McElroy.
It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
I'm trying. It's weird, that's all. I never had any good luck, until I met you...what if it's all just another bad dream?
I might wake up.
When'd you get in?
Go. Just <u>go</u>.
<u>You</u> have humiliated me in public for the <u>last</u> <u>time</u>.
Come on, pal! It was a compliment! You'da done the same if you had the equipment!
<u>He</u> got an E-ticket. Where's mine? <u>When do I get</u> <u>to wake up</u>??
I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
How'd <u>you</u> get in there?
I'm so dumb! I <u>deserve</u> to die -
What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
How are you doing sweetheart?
He seemed quite taken with you.
You know, you never tell me anything.
What's wrong?
Mom, I need to talk to you.
Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!
She would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but, she just started a new job and, well, I guess no one drives here.
So, you come here all by yourself?
Forty-five all total.
Right up there over the Vice- President's chair--the four in the front row represent the four big news services. You've met the press bunch, haven't you?
Those busts up there--all around the wall--who are they, sonny?
You've never *seen* this contract.
It couldn't be.
Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
What's this, Diz?
Well, if you're sure it wouldn't--no use combing my hair for nothing.
Get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit this job in style!
That gorilla in Man's clothing-- McGann.
Well, well--  Yeah--I got smart and thought I'd slip one over on the old man in the press meeting. I said, "Mr. President, about the monopoly investigation--" And he jumps right in and says, "Diz, if you were sitting in my chair, would you answer the question you're about to ask?" He had me.
What dame?
Yeah. Funny--
Again? Good idea.
Good idea. When?
Any time.
I'll cherish ya.
What?
You said it!
He's cooked! They'll drum the poor lug out of that chamber tomorrow as sure as I'm--! And now they're all down on him. Yeah--my press pals, too--he's a bad egg--still water running deep. Boloney! It's the frame of all time! When I see a phoney like this--my journalist blood boils-- I wanna *fight*!  Look, kid--rack your brains, will you? Haven't you got any confidential stuff on that mob? I'll write my arm off--I'll blow Taylor and his--
Kid--he thinks he's talking to that mob at home, but not a line we've written--not a word he's said from that floor has gotten into that home State.
Of all the times! Of all the times! Two months to the end of his term-- and Foley has to go and die on us--
This isn't a home, it's the crossroads of the world!
Nonsense. Why don't you listen to your children for a change? You might actually learn something?
Look here, Jim--if you and Joe are going to gab about this appointment *any* longer, I'm going ahead and see those committees!
You'll see those committees when we're finished!
You couldn't understand! Listen, Ten Thumbs, I'll be on my way to Washington in half an hour. Whatever happens, I'm all ready for this Ranger of yours. Never mind how. You'll get your instructions from Ken Allen here. It isn't anything you have to do. I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp. Allen'll do it himself. You just use your *high office* to help him get it done. Understand?
Gosh, Pop--head of the Boy Rangers!
Yes. Come in.
Maybe you'd like to come along and watch, Governor? Jefferson's done a wonderful job with that leg.
That's easy. Jefferson Smith.
I mean, sir--if I'm going to stay in the Senate--I ought to know what I'm doing--at least, I ought to try to study the Bills that are coming up--
Well, then--I--I don't feel I can stay, sir.
Yes, I was--
Yield *how*, sir?
For a *question*.
Mr. President--
Oh, now--
And Senator Paine too, Ma--we'd like to have him--
Like what, Mr. Taylor?
Yes, I'm Saunders--and this is Mr. Moore--a member of the press. Meet the *Senator*, Mr. Moore.
Tonight.
Good. Where are we?
What's that?
What?
Well, anyway, it's *something* like that--  And it *is* important. That--that Steering Committee has *got* to see it that way. And I'm sure Senator Paine will do all he can--  He's a fine man, Miss Saunders, isn't he? He knew my father, you know.
Have you always had to--work?
No complaints.
I never met anyone more--more intelligent--or capable. I--I don't know where I'd be on this bill of mine without your help--
I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time--  I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it?
Saunders--!
No. That night--I--well, *you* know-- I was pretty--. No--Diz is a--a sort of brother, that's all--
*Gentlemen*! Gentlemen are supposed to believe in something decent. Instead of twisting facts and making a joke of everything--why don't you tell the people the *truth* for a change?
Well! You don't say!
Well! Hear anything? Any sign of him?
What do you mean? What's going on?
Let's get away from here. 
Be quiet, Chick--I'm trying to think--  This Deficiency Bill is going to be read in the Senate tomorrow.
My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.
Oh, now--that won't do--
You see--Governor Hopper made an appointment in this case that--well, Jeff isn't exactly fitted to the work, let's say. He's here to see monuments--and pass the time. That's important to--to my work--and everybody concerned. So, someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of trouble--
What do you mean?
It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
Jim!
I hit him from the floor with everything I knew!
His first 'whiff'!
What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
Mr. President...
I accuse this man--by his tone--by his careful denials--he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct--! *I'll* tell you why we were in tht room. Because Mr. Taylor, a respected citizen of our State, had brought with him the evidence against this man, later presented from this floor, and *we were urging him to resign*-- !
Order!
Yes, sir.
Any children?
Yes!
Yes!
Are they true!
Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him.
What's that got to do with it?
You've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you?  All those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?
Look - there's Brookfield, the poet.
What did they say?
Huh?  Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.
Have you seen the papers?
It's wonderful.
Oh, I don't know.
He played in the town band, too.
He did? I play the tuba
Well, here we are again.
You haven't gotten very far, have you? That's where you were an hour ago. Come on, let's knock off and go down to Joe's. The gang's waiting for us.
Search me. Ask the Gypsies.
The guy's balmy.
Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again.
Why there she is!  Of course she's home.  Stupid of me . . .
Had the boys follow us.
With pay!  She is out the door.
I'm going to tell him the truth.
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
This is for you , Mac. The names of all the headwaiters in town. You can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices.
Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
Yes, sir.
Gold, eh?
Yes, sir.
Must we have the echo?
Your Honor, I object.
Yeah. A glorified doormat.
Where?
All set.
Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
Yes.
Why, no.
Mr. Cobb here is an ex-newspaperman associated with your uncle for many years - as a sort of buffer.
What for?
Will you have a cigar?
It's merely a suggestion. I don't wish to press the point, Mr. Deeds, but if you'll give me your Power of Attorney we'll take care of everything. It'll save you a lot of petty annoyances. Every shark in town will be trying to sell you something.
Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet.
Oh, it'll do in a pinch.
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington.
"There once was a man named Cobb, Who kept Semple away from the mob. Came the turn of the tide And Semple - he died - And now poor Cobb's out of a job!"
Sometimes it's the only solution.
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
my wife wanted me to tell you she  she prays for you every night.
What kind of wife did you say she was?
What about it, Mr. Deeds?
Huh?
There's one nice thing about being rich - you ring a bell and things happen. When the servant comes in, Mr. Hallor, I'm going to ask him to show you to the door. Many people don't know where it is.
Please, Mr. Cedar!  Proceed.
Huh? On, no. Nobody important.
Uh-huh.
I write poetry.
Brookfield just came in.
Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet  thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
Binge?
No, he's too fussy for that. That's what's the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be married
South Dakota - north?
Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
Every man to his taste, sir.
Mr. Deeds - Mr. Deeds, sir - you really must get up. It's late!
As a matter of fact, you came home without any clothes. You were in your - uh - shorts. Yes, sir.
Hey, did you hear that?
But she isn't due for an hour, sir.
They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more.  What do you think about that?
Uh-huh. What are they?
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
Take your time.
Dr. Mumford.
But you do therapy?
But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd.
...I won't go into that today. Though, if we should continue these sessions, as I certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that I would like to look at. God knows, I've listened to enough people giving me the juicy --  ...At any rate, I just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. I just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow.
I see.
What's that?
I don't want to hear any more today.
Why not?
Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
Mr. Follett.
No?
Where's your wife, Henry?
I was... never satisfied.
Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.
I didn't see you there. Can I help you?
Doc. Nice to meet you.
Clarence Norman White, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged?
Yes, your honor.
That's a lot of people all at once.
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
What do you want to know?
How long you been in this town?
Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long.  And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
And the Brocketts?
It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard.  Then I did my laundry... watched 20/20.
Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful?  You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
Okay.
What it might take is... doing time.
Maybe some of us don't need this crap!
Don't need it.
I just got my license two weeks ago.
What's wrong with her?
Hello, Mother. I want you to meet Dr. Mumford.
We're going for a walk.
No, I really don't.
I think you do.
Wow. You're something.
No.
We'll take it slow. You'll never feel you can't handle it.
People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
No.
Painful lymph glands?  Forget fulness... irritability... depression?
There... I've given myself a real whopper.
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.
Transference!
I guess you saw the show...?
...How violated I feel?
You feel violated?
Will you think about it?
Oh.
...so he already had the tattoo that said, "Naomi Forever"... and now they're broken up, see, and he has to have it removed. But while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets Chandra. And it's serious, immediate love. So in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in North America.
What do you want me to see?
What are you doing? We're not done. I just need to find the thing...
Really?
Can I ask you a personal question?
I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
So, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... Is your problem really that you're... lonely?
Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.
She's probably ten years older than you.
Good-looking woman.
How many sessions have we had now, Doc?  Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit.
Slash what?
Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.
Where ya going? I've got a million questions.
Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
Really?
Doc!... It's not me, is it?
That was a terrible thing.
Yes... your particular approach.
Now go find me a big stick.
So you're the one leading the Americans, I shoulda figured. So what's the scam? You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot?
Why do you like to fight so much?
Where's your new friend?
You put up with me, because I can read and write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library.
What is he doing here?
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
What are you doing here?
-- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead.
Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
We're almost there.
Not unless you call me Rick.
Oh my god, I've dreamed about this ever since I was a little girl.
Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? And was he rich?
Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the early Pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.
I'm your sister.
It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this
Where's my gun?
You did not!?... We're not!?
Everything's going exactly as we planned.
We didn't think this through very well.
Hey... Can I buy you a beer?
What did he mean?
Yes!
He's dead.
Doc, these are my friends. We're superheroes, and we need your help.
Snap out of it!
Have you considered my offer?
I got it.
I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead ringer for Veronica Lake in "The Blue Dahlia".
I thought you'd chickened out on me.
Curiosity.
Who?
Sure.
It's home.
It's me.
At the Frankenstein Center.
And what if you get killed?
We had an off night, that's all.
I'm liking this.
I'll drive.
He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses -- and it's him!
I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
I can't.
Why not?
But there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.
Roy --
Here you go. 
We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
This is bad.
Who are they?
The who?
And a social life.
But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.
I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.
I have heard that story but I do not believe it.
Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?
And, what a great pleasure it is, indeed, to meet you, Alexander.
Please...
Things are quite serious, I should say.
There are none here.
And where is the army?
It is on this road, sire, following me.
I believe you are acquainted with my brother, Joseph Bonaparte, and my aide, Major Junot.
Captain Charles, I believe you are one of General Le Clerc's aides-de- camp.
Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
Then, you have my thanks, Captain Charles, for safely escorting Madame Bonaparte to Milan, and you may consider your assignment completed.
Why are you carrying the dog?
The first reports came in at about ten.
From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city.  The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city.
No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again.
But, my dear Duroc, how can I act without guidance from Vienna?  I haven't the slightest idea of how the Emperor Francis might feel about this.
Good morning, sir.  Are you General Bonaparte?
That is correct.
I fear our meeting is long overdue... Napoleon.
No -- not as a rule.
Yes, I am, sir.
Then what brings you out on such a night?
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
What's your name?
Lisette La Croix.
Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
I would like both of you to read this.  Please read it aloud.
I know of no better time.
But you can do the same thing in six months.  The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life.
Ah, how nice to meet you, General Bonaparte.  One has read so much about you lately.  Please sit down.
Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.
And you, are you in love with any one else?
Of course.
Promise me you will never leave me.
Promise me.
I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.
Yes -- what is it?
I didn't mean the things that I said... I was angry and I said more than I meant to.
Oh -- I didn't tell you... I've seen Dr. Corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging.  He has had excellent results with the waters of Plombiers, and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently, he sent Madame Le Floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins.
I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.
Nothing.  That's all I can say.
I didn't want to hurt you... All I wanted to do was to keep from hurting you.  I swear I didn't want to hurt you.
About Hippolyte Charles.
My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.
You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
A revolution is not a polite discussion in a parlor, Citizen Lieutenant.  One does not call it murder to kill such vermin.
What did you say his name was?
Yes, sir.
Major Lavallette to see you, General.
Anything you need.
Alright, I'll remember that.
What you mean talk to her?
Nobody!
That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too.
I walked.
Thanks a lot, Craig.
You make it sound so easy.
Naw, you go first.
No.
I will.  When can I come visit?
I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes.
You did all this for me?
What it smell like?
I can't get jiggy with this shit.  Where is the damn manager?
Bullshit!  I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
Look, Roach, I know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited.  But if Pinky catches you doing that X-Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired.  You feel me?
Did you see that?  That was a W.W.F. hit right there, huh, Day-Day?
Call me.
What?!  This look like a 7-11 or something?  Get the fuck outta here!
Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.
Where did Craig move to?
What?
I'll take you later.
I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
Damn, big bro.  You swung that like Sammy Sosa.
What's the matter?
Okay, okay, that's enough.  Go put on some damn clothes.
Elroy.
I threw my back, again.
Aw, no lovin' tonight?
Sorry.
I need your help.
That's right.
I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.
Is this about those kids? Look, I'm sorry about that. But they darn near...
Yes, yes, I understand.
He's dead?
That's right. He's dead. Tell me why.
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
...twenty-six minutes to get your shit together.
I don't know.
But...
I can hear you good. Can you hear me?
He has to say "over and out". Daddy, you have to say "over and out".
All right.
Will you promise me that?
All right. Kisses to you.
You remember me?
What?
In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom.
Who?
It's about time I did. I was one of those guys, workaholics. I worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter.  That's just what I thought I was supposed to do.
What are you going to do!?
For the last time, I don't want it cleaned. Now get the hell out of here!
I don't have to pay you nothin'.
I'm not a baby.
Yeah.
Get moving.
No.
Keep talkin', Preacher.
You understand?
You got common sense. She ain't. When you grow up that money'll be yours. Now swear. "I will guard Pearl with my life..."
She don't put in at Cresap's Landing no more, but she still blows as she passes. Come on in and have a cup of coffee.
Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.
Where's Ruby?
Lynch him! Lynch him!
Draggin' the name of the Lord through the evil mud of his soul!
Willa Harper there is certain plain facts of life that adds up just like two plus two makes four and one of them is this: No woman is good enough to raise growin' youngsters alone! The Lord meant that job for two!
Pearl dotes on him.
What he needs is a dose o' salts!
Amen! Amen!
My dear, dear friends! Whatever would I do without you!
Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
Did you hear what I said, son?
It -- she --
Now! Where's it hid, honey?
Don't you believe me?
Now: Where?
Nothin'. 
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
You see? We can't have anything to do with John.  You and me will go down to the parlor.
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.
The first night?
Our honeymoon.
You thought, Willa, that the moment you walked in that door I'd start in to pawing you in the abominable way men are supposed to do on their wedding night. Ain't that right, now?
Do you want more children, Willa?
Are you through praying?
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
I been bad!
You'll whip me!
Now who was this?
Because he was scary, that's why.
You okay?
Haven't slept, have you?
No.
You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
Hello?
That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
Did you sleep?
I must be going nuts...
What's with the bars?
And then what happened?
You feel better now, right?
No more fights.
What are you serving?
About what?
Ever since you have been back from Paris...
That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
I have nothing to hide.
I see.
No, that's not him...
If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin such a wonderful report about us, who knows what would have happened?
We don't like Razinin.
With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
All you have to do is say "open sesame."
Good morning, Your Highness.
Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds and make yourself agreeable to the Whites if you don't keep up your strength.
I guess it is eight forty-two.
If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
You're looking magnificent, Leon...  ...isn't he, General Savitzky?
General, would you mind making my excuses at our table? I'll be back in a few moments.
There's something in Constantinople... something irresistible....
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
What proposition?
Razinin.
I am looking for Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
Only myself and two other girls. One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor.
This is Comrade Kopalski.
I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...
That's even better.
She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!
How are you, you three scoundrels?
The same spring we had in Paris. Just as good.
Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....
That's two weeks from Thursday...
We'll leave these papers here for your further consideration. Au revoir, madame.
Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl.
What?
No.
Can I help you?
Love to.
Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we?
Here... here we are... here you are and here I am... feel it?
I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
Do not misunderstand me. I do not hold your frivolity against you.  As basic material you might not be bad, but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. I feel sorry for you.
Does that mean that you want me to go there?
Please don't misunderstand me...
No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
That is why I believe in the future of my country.
What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...
Don't do it, please.
The bayonet? Did you really?
It's false sentimentality.
Thank you.
Room service speaking.
I don't like your following me.
What are you after?
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
I suppose you don't think that's funny?
No.
It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!
I don't look too foolish?
You remember this room?
You see I couldn't shout that.
No speech?
No! No!
Much happier.
Radio! What is radio?
It's dead.
If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.
Hello, Leon!
Those newspaper people?
Now, Swana...
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Did I hear something about jewels?
What did he say?
Make it ice cold.
Yes, Swana.
Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you?
No thanks, Swana.
Hello, Leon darling!
Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted.
What?
No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.
Here, please...
Yes, it does.
You mean you have finished the whole investigation?
I haven't either, but I've heard about them. You must realize it was only on the strength of your Paris report that I sent them to Constantinople; without that I never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal.
May I ask what has happened?
It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.
How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.
Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by.
This way, madame. Are you alone? By the window perhaps?  Or a nice little corner table?
Bring me something simple. I never think about food.
Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...
Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
Frankly, sir, it stinks.  I have no access.  I'm lucky Helms lets me have a staff.
I'm not going to be the scapegoat for this.  Haldeman and Ehrlichman are in just as deep as me.
I think he means the Kennedy assassination.
Colson doesn't know about it; he's pure as a virgin on this one.  It's just not clear the burglars knew what they were looking for.  They were heading to McGovern's office later that night.
Mitchell?
Where's Hunt now?
In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to me.
He's begging for a meeting, chief.  He wants to go overseas for awhile.
No, you didn't, Bob.
What about England?
About a dozen.
... an action that will at last, once and for all, show that what I knew and what I did with regard to the Watergate break-in and cover-up were just as I have described them to you from the very beginning ...
... you mentioned the "Bay of Pigs" several times.  Sooner or later they're going to want to know what that means.  They're going to want to know what was on that gap ...
It came over from Vietnam, you know.
What's Liddy got?
Fucking hell.
All right.
This isn't a "moral" issue, Bob.  We have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes.  The FBI is filled with people who are pissed that I put Gray in and not one of their own.  Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union: when you look at the big picture, Bob, you'll see we're doing a hell of a lotta good in this world.  Let's not screw it up with some shit-ass, third-rate burglary.
Cue the crowd.  Go to the woman's group.  Get the bald guy, he's great ...
The first assassination attempt was in '60, just before the election.
So?  You wanted Castro dead. Everybody wanted Castro dead.  If Hunt and the others are CIA, why don't we just throw this back in the CIA's lap? Let Richard Helms take the fall?
... and we've got the economic guys at five.  The Dow lost another 16 points. They're going to want a decision on the budget.  Sir?  ... Are we holding the line on a balanced budget?
No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
Don't forget the South, sir, the West. Filled with the good football colleges, straight kids.  There's more of 'em with you than against you.  Not like these mudmutts.
She got it, Bob.  A nineteen-year-old college kid ...
Sir?
I don't ... have them.  Mother ... I swear, I ... didn't smoke.
We haven't said grace yet.  Richard.
Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them.
What?
Well, we'll lodge a formal protest.
I never thought Jack was ready for the presidency.  But I would never, never consider ...  His death was awful, an awful thing for this country.  Do you ever think of death, Mr. Helms?
... little Bobby.
Ummm...
Can't we just talk here?  I've got the police chiefs in San Diego.
Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
You'll win the nomination.
Or he'll steal it like his brother. He's a mean little sonofabitch, Edgar ... He had the IRS audit my mother when she was dying in a nursing home.
There must be a quarter-million out there, Edgar.  They've been at it now for a year.  Young kids just like Tricia.  I don't know.  Do you think they have a point, Edgar?  Maybe this whole damned system of government is ...
This damned tie ... Will you help me, Edgar?  Churchill used to say to me, "If you want your own history written properly, you must write it yourself."  All right, Edgar, but just don't let it come back to haunt me.
You're fucking me.
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
That's triangular diplomacy, gentlemen.
Not at all.  This is not going to leak, is it?
Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?
He was a politician.
Why?
So ... how's the food over there in China, Mr. Nixon?
We can prosecute the New York Times, go for an injunction ...
I wanna fight just as dirty as he does.
Where you from?
The Orangemen!  Now there's a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ...
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
We didn't come here to talk about football.  We came here to end the war.
No, we don't!  You're full of shit! You say you want to end the war, so why don't you?  My brother died over there last November.  Why?  What good was his death?
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
You're not a failure, Dick.
Dick, don't...
Buddy? ...
He looked old, didn't he?
I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
I'm not scared, Buddy.  You don't understand.  They're playing for keeps, Buddy.  The press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down.
Yes.
Repartee, Dick -- very good.  Hey, I feel ten years younger!  It makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life?
Won or lost?
Sounds like you got a crisis syndrome. Aren't you exaggerating a bit, Dick? Call it three-and-a-half, maybe four ...
How'd you know I was here.
Didn't know there was any.
Nineteen zero and nine.
No ID in her room?
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
Who's he in trouble with then?
Yes ma'am?
Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway.
...You ride Winston.
...How come do you reckon the coyotes ain't been at 'em?
So when was he here?
...Now that's aggravating.
That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him?
...Could I get you to call Loretta and tell her I've gone to Odessa? goin' to visit with Carla Jean Moss.
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
Well I didn't see it.
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
What's in the satchel?
You keep running that mouth I'm gonna take you in the back and screw you.
Yeah.
Odessa.
You can't afford one?
Mama's gonna raise hell.
You are comin back, ain't ya?
Hey.
Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?
And where is that.
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
...You getting anything on this?
Yeah, that'll suck some power. Over time.
I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going?
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
You know how this is going to turn out, don't you?
Now. We close now.
...What time do you go to bed.
Uh-huh.
What kind of tent?
When did you last see him.
Yes?
...You pick the option with the applicable rate.
You want to change rooms?
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
You can have the one next to yours if you want. One twenty.  It ain't took.
Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
Sugar?
I know how he found me.
No sir. I'm a veteran.
Could I have that in American?
Sorry you had to see that. You were saying?
Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.
Okay, let's go... I got nothing for the record yet.
Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman.
You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
Junior year!
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
We think we know where Betty is.
Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
Well, do something, then, damnit!
'Kay, good. Bye, then...
Who are these idiots?
...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
Umm, I don't think that...
I better go check on them.
I'd rather not...
Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted...  I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
Well, I certainly would have heard about that.
It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
Are you and Larry happy?
Halfway where? You've gotta come home. We've been worried sick about you. Are you alright?
Do what?
Oh, you mean Fred.
I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del?
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
I just want everything to be perfect between us.
Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second?
Well, I don't know what you had in mind, but I hope you're happy. I put myself on the line for you, my reputation, and you're making me look like an idiot.
What do you mean? What did I do to you...
I'm sorry... Oh my gosh, are you George McCord?!
Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...
Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
I have... did it sound that bad?
Sure you don't want any salad?
I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
...well, then you ain't got much.
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for?
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
Hi, Betty. You're looking good...
Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...
Ahh, look, right now's not very...
Have you checked the trunk of that car you're driving, Betty? I think there might be...
I begged him to let me put that on!
Let me tell you something. I got groped by these Tunisian guys who thought I was a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter than stink the whole time, and I got some kind of weird gum disease from the water. Plus, it ended my marriage --
I left my husband two days ago.
Piss off, Merle.  So how you gonna find him, Betty?
You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
Hey, Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County...
You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy...  So, how'd it go today? You find him?
You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
How many men have I talked to?
Why'd you help me in the first place?
Looking for someone?
Were you with him this whole time?
Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?
...this is your sweater, right?
Where are you going?
What?! That you had something to do with it?
I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
No, that should be more than --
Here's Ghengis Kunt and The Demilitarized Zone. Get it?  They're Korean, so they're pretty hot.
No...
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
Now, that's really stupid.
We can live with that.
Let's get out of here. We got another long drive ahead of us.  ...the fuck where I do not know, but I know it's gonna be long.
Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in touch...
They paid us half. They still owe us half...
No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
Well... I think I saw her soul.
Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
Wesley...
Man, you have got to get some therapy.
Really?
Can I have an evil twin?
Uh-huh.
...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
Huh?
Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.
...Pete?
Huh?!
...but try getting a decent hair jelly.
This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett.
We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.
What's his name again?
Latch right on to that tit.
Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.
It's just a symbol, honey -
That's good, honey.
Yes, but honey -
Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!
I am. Hur you?
How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?
She's at the five and dime.
So what're you doing in Seattle?
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya?
No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this.
Sir, this candidate believes he'll make a good officer, sir!
I know.
I called you Sarge.
Before that.
No, sir.
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
Yes I do!
You been through the Dilbert Dunker yet?
Come on, guys. It's five o'clock.
He ask you out for next weekend?
Paula, how far would you go to catch Zack?
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
What did you tell him about the baby?
Seriously.
Not me.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.
Come on. Invite me. All day the idea of a family Sunday dinner's been coming into my head. Since you're the only one I know around here with family...
No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you.
I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises.  Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
The kid on the windy side of the baker's window. That's how he put it.
I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.
Thanks for covering for me.
No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
So what's the problem? Girls do that all the time.
No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" Zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and I couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived.
What the fuck is funny about this?
God.
I have the gun.
NOT THAT ONE?!
Fuck.
They're not supposed to be here!
Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?
Unless Daddy comes back later.
I'm afraid to let you think, Junior. Things get worse when you think.  Oh, that's gonna help.
She said she did.
Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are you gonna get us into that room?
Be quiet.
Cell phone.
Everything okay?
Can we come in?
Your husband says you said "There are three..." right before you got cut off.
Got us in here, didn't I?
The phone works.  Hey, I hooked up the phone.
I heard you.
"Get the fuck out of my house."
Why did the chicken cross the road?
What, what, what is it?!
Blue is phones?
Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  Did you see any sugar in here?  Any candy bars, anything sweet?
Yeah... whatever you say.
Get out of the car.
Brimmer you're fucked up...
Man, fuck you!!!
Heh, bunch of shines running around in dark caps waving their fists about some streetlight. They're loud, but they aren't dangerous,
Yes sir I was.
And did you witness the shoot-out?
From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
Huh, well then...  did someone else start shooting?
We're working on that...
We appreciate your help with this.
You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
Hey, GI bill pays for school. And shit, if I stuck around here, instead of signing up, I'd probably be in jail, or sitting on the stoop drinking Bitter Dog with Rose, you know?
I saw... but...
This cool the heat off you any?
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
I say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket wadding.
Well?
What do you mean, old and ugly?
You got salt last week.
They're from good stock on their mother's side.
You look well, Charlotte.
How did this... how did I let this happen?
I said, I'm not my sister.
Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name.
You are familiar with how these things are done.  In fact, I would like to claim aggrieved status.
First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me.
Very well, let us move on to...
Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
When you have children, I hope you'll understand.
Do you intend to enlist without my permission?
We put out the word.  We'll start along the south side of the Santee...
Where?
Don't go in there.
Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?
Tell me what everyone doesn't know.
Green Dragoons came to my home, killed my son, Thomas.  It was Tarleton himself.
There's nothing you could have done, Gates is a damned fool.
How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?
Two.  Gabriel and Thomas.
Thank you.
Margaret, take William and Susan to the river shed.  Hide there.  If we're not back by dawn, go up the river to the Richardson's house. They'll take you to your Aunt Charlotte's farm.  Nathan, Samuel, and I are going to get Gabriel.
How many came back?
Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something really bad. He--
Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time.
Ellie? What's wrong?
Yeah, sure.
How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children!
Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--
Not at all.
Allman Brothers.
I'm not climbing that.
No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?
It's funny, all right.
Doesn't look like they last long.
Wendigo?
I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---
It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.
That's enough of that kind of talk!
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
You can go to your grave not knowing.
I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end well for you.
I'll drop it!
You've got sand, for a maid.
Agreed.  You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune --
Then I can wear men's clothing.
It's -- beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion?
Parlay!  I invoke the right of parlay!  According to the Code of the Brethern, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!
Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
If I had known --
I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us.
You are despicable.
You're in league with Barbossa!
Captain Sparrow!  We have to get off this island -- immediately!
But ... you did it before!  Last time --
Last time, I was here a grand total of three days.  Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.  But from the looks of this, they've been out of business, and so that won't be happening again.  We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.
That was before I met one, of course.
Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to.  All I need is a crew.
How did you get off the island?
What?  He never told me that.
We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few--
This dock is off-limits to civilians.
Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
But it seems to be enough to condemn him.
Norrington, think about it ... the Black Pearl, its captain and crew ... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean.  How can you pass that up?
I don't like the situation, Mister Sparrow.  The island is riddled with caves.  I will not put my men at a disadvantage.
Who makes all these?
No.
Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
Somewhat.
Not without my effects.
My business, Will.  As for your business -- one question, or there's no use going.  This girl -- what does she mean to you?  How far are you willing to go to save her?
It's still against the law.
I swear, you look just like him.
Depends.
On what?
Jack!
Yes.
Yes, I have.
What's your business in Port Royal, 'Mr. Smith'?
Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
Not anymore, Mr. O'Brien.  The nanobot has changed that.
You can't do this!  You owe me, O'Brien.  I made you plastic!  I made you!
She's lying.  She lost the first one on purpose.
A containment crew is going to attract a lot of attention.
Then you still love me?
Did I?  I've been waiting for that for years.
She could have given him something to stimulate his kidneys.
You have no idea what this is doing to your body.
So what?  So what?  For starters, how about littering is a crime.
What are you going to do?
Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners.
Daniel...
I guess I should be flattered.
We'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange.
I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up!  If you're gonna flip your wig --
... just like the mouse.
Oh no, no, no!  You've got to be able to fix me!  Please, Susan, tell me you can make me normal again!
Mostly caffeine diuretics.  Help you go to the bathroom.
Just giving credit where credit is due.
All the different ways that I could kill you.
And you have him?
What in the hell?
Certainly. Right over there.
Ah!  But you don't know who Bobo is. And you don't know who Babykins is.
Oh, I don't need another guess. It's quite obvious.
Hello, Natalie. Mr. Stewart Smith . . . Miss Montgomery, Mrs. Eames, Mrs. Radcliff, Mr. Radcliff
Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.
You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you?
Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll wear garters and you'll like it too!
No? What do you look upon her as?
You've done nothing but watch me - watch me! - ever since I've been here. Treated me like a thug, watched me like a hawk, mistrusted me. Every time I leave the house, that Jane  goes out and counts the silverware.
Who is it you wish to see, sir?
a beautiful pair of shoulders! But listen now, as a favor, will you please make it snappy, Laughing Waters,[14] and tell Stew Smith I gotta see him because if you don't my whole family's going to die.
I got him his job on the paper. I'm a stock-holder, you know.
Is that so?
Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman.
I bring a message from Garcia.
Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends. Big Chief very sorry. To show how sorry - will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines.
Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
Now listen, we've got a tip that the Schuyler family has finally made a deal with that chorus dame.
Yeah, little Gloria.
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
Come on, get going, get going!
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
No!
Yes. I must have been pretty much plastered if I hired a valet.
I think I understand, sir. You mean you want me to go?
He's probably very tired. You see, he's had to meet all these people personally tonight.
Well, I've seen her pictures, and I don't think she's so hot.
Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
Thanks, thanks.
Joe! A little snifter.  Say, wasn't I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that, huh?  Look at that! I don't know how I rate that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's a swell girl. I want you to meet her.
Remember, she's a Schuyler.
Oh, I'll call you up some time. And if your social duties permit - why -
How is her family going to feel about it?
There you are!
Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help.
To Old Madrid.
What do you know about Conrad?
Right.
Now Gallagher, if we could only get a great scene - a tremendously emotional scene - something that would just wring the hearts out of the public - to bring the curtain down in the second act - that would be okay. Couldn't dig one out of your hat some place, could you?
Sorry, boss
It's a swell idea, Gallagher. How's this?  The wife's family lawyer comes to see the kid, see - to talk over the divorce. Then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony - so the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out. How's that for the beginning of the third act, huh?
I think you'd better go.
Surely, come right in.
She did?
She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.
Wait a minute. Do I get from you that she wants to pay me alimony?
Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
Well done, sir. Very neat.
Yes, sir.
That's puttering, sir.
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
Yes sir.
You sir? Uh-uh. You could never be a putterer. Not a good putterer, sir.
Mary Sue?
No. I want to know.
You sure you want to know this?
Yes ...  It's just that ...
Bud. Mary Sue ... Breakfast is on the table.
Isn't it great how she's resting like that?
Wait ...
What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?
I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you?
What are you doing?
I don't believe it.
What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a little "different" lately ...
And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.
It's like the basketball team.
It's not in ME.
Well, I never had to do it before.
And where's that?
No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!
One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
It's in your closet.
They're happy like this.
Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
I told you. I'm like positive.
Besides. You think there's like a chance I'm gonna get into college back there?
Do they have an Ocean? I've heard about the ocean.
What's that like?
Scout?
Say--why don't you take this remote instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph" in it.
Why would I do that?
... Hi.
I'm going to leave now.
So ... I guess as long as I'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue trees ...
Now Buddy, you're going on trial tomorrow. And if they find you guilty, you're gonna be stuck here forever. Well, not forever--lemme think ...  Five year sentence ... Carry the three ... That comes out to ... sixteen and a half centuries, and that's rounding down.
Have you cooked the burgers?
You think you could do this like soon? It's almost six thirty.
Free?
This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
Hey.
I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
"chat?" Did you just say "chat?"
Did you think that we'd all be looking at you?
Do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases?
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
Yeah but please don't do that: everyone would be looking at me.
It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
So it's ok if I bring her.
You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway --
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
What?
What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --
Hi, is this Jack?
Do you like porno movies?
Yeah. And looking at myself in the mirror. Do you wanna know what I look like?
No.
Hey. What are you doing? How are you?
Georgia.
Yes.
Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
Yeah. It's so hard these days and I really need it.
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
I need help.
-- you said you did.
No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
I don't know.
I don't know.
That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.
Oh My God.
I'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me?
Can I write down my address and phone number for you?
This is funny.
That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
Yes.
What?
I'll be around and back in town in a few days --
Yeah.
That was good.
Yeah.
I'll see you later.
Have a good trip.
Hello?
I just wanted to make sure.
Yeah.
For work.....
That's right you travel so much.
I forgot about that.
Yes I'm sorry.
What is this?
....I'm not exactly sure what that means...
Right. Alright, lemme call you first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna run the numbers, see what's what and I'll give you a call back --
Did you do it?
No.
Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
Why? ...what?
I didn't do it.
Alright, well you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to go.
......and this is confidential?
And your name?
-- and this is confidential?
It's ok, take your time.
I just don't want anyone to know it's me.
Who is this?
I said calm down and shut the fuck up. What's your problem?
How many sisters do you have?
How's business?
What's up?
It's alright.
I don't like the way I am sometimes.  Can you help me? WALTER Barry, I'm a dentist, what kind of help do you think I can give you?
Ok.
What?
Wait a minute --
Are you going to the party tonight?
I know.
Yeah but I'm serious.
That's cool.
Put him through.
Are you sure?
Are you ready?
I have no idea what he's doing then. I'm sorry that didn't work out.
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
I'm sorry. You're right.
It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.
If you're going to slander him, then you don't deserve to hear his stories --
Had I known your taste in novels, I never would've taught you to read.
I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
By whom? The Marquis?
Madeleine, I... there are certain things... feelings... we must not voice.
Don't come back, not tonight, not again --
Take your pen in hand, Marquis. Purge these wicked thoughts of yours on paper; maybe they'll govern you less in life.
Enough to discern its tenor.
It's not even a proper novel! It's nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions! Frankly, it even fails as an exercise in craft. The characters are wooden; the dialogue is inane. Not to mention the endless repetition of words like "nipple" and "pikestaff" --
One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties!
You mean to take us all down with you?
Perhaps -- in time -- you'll earn them back through good behavior --
I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
My bed, gone! Am I to freeze to death?
I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
Go to hell!
I FUCKED HER COUNTLESS TIMES! IN EVERY ORIFICE! AND ALL THE WHILE, SHE PLEAD FOR MORE --
This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?
Indiscretions, Abbe? Please. I've read his case history. At sixteen, he violated a serving girl with a crucifix. After six months in the dungeon at Vincennes, he mutilated a prostitute, cutting her flesh with a razor, then cauterizing the wounds with wax --
And place my reputation at stake?
It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
Charenton? The administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not?
Here it is; the last chapter.
My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal!
Yes?
Don't start --
You? Frighten me? That's a good one! I'm twice as fast as you are. Who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?
The story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium.
My newest book begins at my right cuff, continues across my back, and completes itself at the base of my left shoe...
It needn't be; not if you've another story.
How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
Tell him -- if he uncovers our whereabouts -- you'll slit your wrists with a razor, and I'll plunge a hat- pin through my heart.
You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
What thought is that?
It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?
Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
That poor woman.
It's not so bad here. After all, what girl doesn't want to live in a castle?
And attractive in a hammy sort of way.
Listen, you come down and stay with us for a few days. Just tell the old man that--
Thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts You were a great star and you had a good run. That oughta be enough.
The character that's supposed to be me, Susan Alexander--
I see. And you are in California for what reason?
In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed.
And maybe we could get Mr. Warner and Mr. Goldwyn and Mr. Cohn and Mr. Selznick to play as well.
You know that can't happen.
There's no call for that language-
You gotta wake up now. Pops.
Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
I will not have this in my home.
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
I can't remember the lines!
This is the chance you've been waiting for, boy. Tell that son of a bitch just what you think of him!
Schaefer, I gotta see this Welles picture
Oh for God's sake, Louella-
And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.
Nope.
Not for me.
That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.
Like a bug.
How about Howard Hughes? We could do Hughes
I don't wanna write about no spic.
The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.
I know who we're going to get I The great American biography! A journey into the soul of the beast.
Yes.
So, who is he? We have to know him.
Why her?
Yeah, but the margins are real wide.
What?
I'm sorry.
Me, I'm proud to be a Jew, I got no problem. You don't like it, fuck you. But with these guys it's like a dirty word. All they wanna be is good red- white-and-blue Americans, and the way they see it you can't be a good American and a Jew. So Sam Goldfish becomes Sam Goldwyn and David Selznick becomes David 0. Selznick -- like anyone's gonna think he's Irish for fuck's sake--
Mank!
They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for the negative and all the prints.
May I help you?
Thank you-
That's for me to decide.
It was fun, wasn't it?
So, on to the Life Of Christ!
Orson, you wanna take five?
No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
Now the fight's off the books altogether. Meyer Lansky couldn't get a bet down on this fight. Some people are saying you're going into the tank.
Here's your carrots. You're in such a hurry. You can't wait.
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
Yeah. Do me a favor.
What was that for? I know you can take punches. I can hit you from now to doomsday. What the fuck does that prove?
Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I...
With her? How?
Nah, she would never...
What did Tommy say?
Stick out your hands, Jake.
What the fuck they want? I took the dive. They want me to fall down too? I don't fall down for nobody. I never went down in my life. Joey, what do I gotta do? Crawl on my hands and knees? I made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' Garden! All the newspaper writers make fun of me. I'm the bum of the year. All I want is a shot. Just a fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do? I'll do anything.
Except fall down like a normal person.
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
Whatsa matter with you?
Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?
Ain't she beautiful? Coulda been Mrs. America if I didn't pull her outa the contest. Didn't want her wearing a swimsuit for nobody but me.
Joey said you wanted to meet me. Is that right? You wanted to meet me?
Who asked you?
No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
Vickie?... Vickie, you asleep?
That he's got a pretty face.
What's the matter with you?
You know, if there's one thing -- I just don't understand you, not one single little bit. You love me?
Open the door, Vickie.
But they don't have a case against you.
All right, lemme ask you something. Let's say I was a good friend of yours. And I was telling you I was gonna bet a lot of money on you in this Janiro fight. What would you tell me?
Salvy, would I steer you wrong? Let's say that's the truck; it's full of cigarettes, right? Now, two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there,  take the cigarettes out, sell 'em, make some cash.
Hey, leave the kids alone.
What do you think, I'm blind? My brother's breaking his ass in a ring, and you're here with his wife.
It's too stupid and obvious a way to murder -- in full view of fifty windows -- and then sit over there --  -- smoking a cigar -- waiting for the police to pick him up.
I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.
His wife took a trip.
A very convenient guy -- this superintendent. Have you checked his bank deposits lately?
If possible -- both.
I mean when he goes out for a paper, or a drink, or something. What he doesn't know won't hurt him.
Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!
A detective's nightmare.
Ever get an answer?
You think he's getting out of here?
Jewelry?
Well, in the garage, back home, we --
This is Doyle, Jeff.
Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.
I told you that --
I don't know what pet name Thorwald had for his wife. And that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. He wasn't taking his possessions, because they're up in his apartment now!
Where'd they take Lisa?
Wrong day?
You did.
With that cast on -- you don't.
It's me.
Well -- did you get it, Thorwald?
Why should I?
I only have a hundred dollars or so.
I predicted it.
Right now I'd even welcome trouble.
Lisa Fremont.
She expects me to marry her.
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.
A Federal offense.
You called the police?
I'm just going to get the name of their truck!
There's probably one in the basement.
-- A steal at eleven hundred dollars.
It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.
Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.
Jeff -- isn't it time you came home? You could pick your assignment.
Make the one you want.
You mean leave the magazine?
Oh... some songwriter. In the studio apartment. Lives alone. Probably had an unhappy marriage.
Those high heels would be a lot of use in the jungle -- and those nylons and six-ounce lingerie --
Three.
And it's deflating to find out that the only way I can be part of it -- is to take out a subscription to your magazine. I guess I'm not the girl I thought I was.
I wouldn't dare answer that.
I don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here.
Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now.
What doesn't?
But only her husband would know that.  And the jewelry! Women don't keep all their jewelry in a purse, all tangled, getting scratched and twisted up.
They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.
Say anything else, and I'll stay tomorrow night too.
From his landlord -- once a month.
I hate funny exit lines.
But you're not?
Suppose Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring was among the jewelry he has in the handbag.  During that phone conversation he held up three rings -- one with a diamond -- one with a big stone of some kind -- and one plain gold band.
How?
Chelsea 2-7099.  We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again.  I'm using that word "we" a little too freely, I guess. I don't take any of the chances.
Get an ambulance.  Don't move. Try to lie still.
Where can we meet?
We got a cookaboo inside.  He wounded some kid earlier.
Except yourself!
No.  I definitely don't.  I did the sa--
Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
I was talking to Jim.
I'll wait for him.
Hi.
No.  I don't think so--
Jim.  What's yours?
You scared?
I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  Do you think it never stops?
No.  It's perpetual motion.
Jim--Do you think when the end of the world comes it'll be at night?
Hey...you flipped--or something? You better take off...
It's me!
I'm here.  Shut up.
Man, you're schizoid!
No.  At dawn.
Here.
We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.
In your pocket.  Give it to me.
Who's that?
Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away.
'Bye, Mom.
It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police?
No!  You're not tearing me loose any more.
Leave me alone.
Things pretty tough for you at home?
A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
How can anyone grow up in this circus?
You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
Here.  Look, will you do something for me?  If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.
Hey!  That's enough static out of you.
Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.
Yeah--why--
I'll bet you're a real yo yo.
Goodbye!  See you!
You still pretty upset?
I don't know, but we can't stay here.
Where can we go?  I can't go back into that zoo.
You disappointed?
Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
What's he like?
Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?
Don't give it a thought.  Only three million dollars a month!
Judy--we're ready for you now.
He hates me.
She's being called for.
We used to sing it in school.  Don't look at me with such horror. They had schools in those days.
Are you and Mom home tonight?
Why?
Gabriel -- !
Read a lot about you, Nick.
Is this him!?
Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's all you ever said...
I can't take watching you touch him. I can't take his hands on you.
Yeah.
Do that again.
What.
Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
Well, wasn't all me, y'know.
Y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too...
Ash, you've gotten me enough --
...the truck driver...
Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --
Nick --
Nick died for me....
So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they?
I love you, Nick...
You're the getaway girl. The money's gonna get to you eventually. Gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. But I can't do that without a gun. Any luck talking to him?
They all are. Football's on.
You shouldn't have.
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
So you could get down her chimney.
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
How much money's in that casino? Day-to-day.
Five million?
Hey, it's... been two years --
I said, who the hell made the map?
Nnn... nothing...
Start singing.
NO.
Six men means six guns.
I'm no threat without a gun.
...so where is he?
Where is he?! Where is he?!
Capades? They don't do it. Mittens? Outlawed. Why?
What about the Powwow Safe?
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
Haven't thought about it.
Hot chocolate.
What?
Oh.
You're GONNA be there! We're getting outta here! TAKE IT!
And you set me up.
Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story I was dead. Once the wound healed up...  Got out of the Mountain this morning. And tonight I'm a rich man.
Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --
Switch seats with me.
Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money!
There is no other table --
You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot -
Holy shit, this guy's all fucked up!
The motherfucker killed Vic.
What? Nobody set anybody up.
How can you tell?
What?
Mr. Brown?
Wong?
Why am I Mr. Pink?
Give me my book.
Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.
Like hell I am.
He don't believe in it.
It's not good...
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
Do you know what this is? It's the world's smallest violin, playing just for the waitresses.
You really think we were set up?
Want a smoke?
That's not correct.
The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.
A few cops.
Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.
That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?
So, is he dead or what?
He ain't dead.
He will be dead fer sure, if we don't get him to a hospital.
Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.
Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're on our own. Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em.
I told ya he'd be pissed.
He seems all right now, but he went crazy in the store.
...Hey, I know what I'm talkin' about, black women ain't the same as white women.
Hello Graham -- Joe -- Mr. Gardner.
You should be. Maybe Lednov heard about that Sonora ranch of yours.
And that's more important than finding Lednov?
It doesn't matter who they are.
As far as -- Sonora?
Of course it'll work. You can get another girl to fill out the act.
Steve maybe you better get some wood for the fire.
They're stragglin'.
Hold on.
Thanks.
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
The who?
You wouldn't do a thing like that, would you?
I can't change either. Not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand.
Why?
You've got to -- don't you understand -- they want me with them and they'll fix it so I have to go --
You never said this Lednov's name before, that I can remember.
No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me.  How's she feel?
A man can't help gettin' excited once in a while.
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
Maybe you shoulda killed him.
I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh?
Yeah, how did you know?
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know you had a daughter.
Runnin' off and worryin' people. Makin' it tougher on Clay than it is already.
That sure smells good.
I saw your fire and dropped by to say hello.
Even women?
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
You think that's all we busted -- You should see...
What's the use.
I'm sure of this. But not of you.  You won't open any joint. I've been watching you change. You're mad now and you think you can change back. But you can't. You'll end up making beds in a boarding house.
Because there's a man I want to see.
Since I can remember, Ma'am.
Would you like to learn them?
Gee, I can't.
No.
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
Hey, Brenda.
I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
Yeah, I think I'll feel better sleeping in the arms of a strong man.
Are you okay? I thought I heard screaming.
So, I see you're really into spooks.
No. I never date outside my race.
That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
Then what kinda stuff can we do?
Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
It looks like the furnace.
Yeah, I think I'm bleeding.
There's something I really want to share with you.
Cindy, about this whole friendship thing...
Listen to me I --
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Stop it! I'm just trying to say I think we should take our friendship to the next level.
I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.
Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!
I don't care. You pick.
Good-night, Cin. I'll be next door if you need me.
Let her go, Cin.
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?
I'm Cindy.
Cool, but remember, as soon as he gets on the platform you gotta get out of there.  Nobody wants to go.
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
You could use the grade, huh?
Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!
Aww, the little bird died.
I take it you're not mad at me.
Yes. The scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.
And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
I have taken care of everything, including medical supplies and blood storage. We want to be safe.
Professor!
Not to worry. There's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years.
The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere.
That's why we came here, remember?
That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.
I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two?
You're not wearing a belt.
She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.
Father, are you okay?
I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man.
 I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
You said you hated him.
Just a little, please. Bad for the teeth.
You'd probably date him!  He's cu-uuute! Hey, Dad, did you ever see "Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer?"
I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin. What's the trouble, officer?
Bye, Birdie.  Chip, honey... I know it's hard being a teenager but I understand... I'm your mother and I love you.
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...
Don't wake the kids...
Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?
"P" as in...
Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever receive obscene telephone calls?
Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's... the day you claim you recognized my voice... you weren't drinking?
Socially... I'll have a beer.
I... I'm not sure...  ...I... oohhh... Excuse me...
I do, please.
And who may I ask is Carl?
0h, that's horrible, honey.  I sold the Pee-Wee Herman doll!!
Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
Man, that one made me puke!
Young man, this Faberge Egg is chipped.
Sure I do.
The name may not mean anything to you, young lady, but say the word and I'll have your sister for you in forty-eight hours.
You can?
Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -
Look. Don't say a word. I've taken an interest in you and I'm willin' to put up my time to help you. Besides, I think I know where to find your sister.
Where?
Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
You think my sister is there?
Which room is it?
When I wanted to.
But tell me --
I don't get this. Miss Jacqueline was always so fond of you -- she was always talking about you - had your picture in her office.
It always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy.
No. She asked about the trademark.
Then you know where Jacqueline is?
Good.
But you have treated me that way.
 What have you done about Irving August?
Oh, I'm making investigations.
Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --
That was Dr. Judd. He was phoning to say that, Jacqueline is on her way here -
Gregory   you'd better take Jacqueline with you tonight.
I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.
Could you find him?
I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.
And then?
If you get lonely, go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me.
You'll be all right?
But you're always at the library.
It isn't that -- you said, "have to go." What could compel you --
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
And you believe that?
Jason, my pet 
Would it be asking too much, Miss Gottschalk, for you to get me these books?
I've lost my knack.
You don't expect me to do that do you?
A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?
Would they hurt her?
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
We don't know, Mary. We've been unable to get in touch with your sister.
But, Mrs. Lowood, I can't just stay here not knowing what's happened to my sister. Maybe if I went to New York -- if I saw Mrs. Redi myself --
Is it fifteen minutes yet?
Children, I want you to be very good and very quiet while I see Mrs. Wheeler a moment. She's going to take over this class for a while.
Why
Because I have something very important to do.
I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
Do you have other things?
Yeah, I guess it is. My mother is a complete Anglophile, anything British makes her drool like a baby. She probably heard the name in some movie. She's a prisoner of public television now.
Oh. Well, I did. I was in a band once, and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible.
I don't know.
Do you want them?
Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.
Well... are you self-conscious about it?
What?
I believe in it for some people. I mean, for me it was silly, I was confused going in. So I just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesn't know you intimately.
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.
I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.
Donna was a girl I knew in Florida.
Yes.
No.
John and Cynthia have been... "fucking".
What will you do when the money runs out?
Tell me your name.
Do you talk to him?
Yes.
You're not like your sister. You couldn't be like her if you wanted to.
On tape?
Can't.
I loved her for how good she made me feel, and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time, I tended to express my feelings non- verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.
Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.
I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.
Subtlety?
No, you're not.
That's very flattering.
But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
Yes.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again?
As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
Why not?
Because.
Come on!!
Oh, we get along okay. She's just very... she's an extrovert. I think she's loud. She probably wouldn't agree. Definitely wouldn't agree.
Tuesday. I had a late lunch.
Who'd you have lunch with?
If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit.
I didn't say it was rational, I just said I was convinced.
Isn't therapy helping at all?
Jesus Christ! What the hell happened? I came home and your car was gone, the door was open, I thought for sure you'd been abducted by some mad fucker, I was literally just calling the cops when you walked in. What happened?
If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over.
But he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework.
When did you begin having this feeling?
Perhaps he senses your hesitance at being touched.
Well, I don't know. The week started off okay, but then I was outside watering the plants, and I started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the Greenhouse Effect, so I went inside and turned on the air-conditioner full blast, and that made me feel a little better until I started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor, and --
Did you confront John about the visitor?
The friend of John's that was staying at your house.
What do you mean, like physically?
What brought this on?
I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
It's possible that Graham has hidden motives for disliking therapy and/or therapists. Perhaps he has problems of his own that he is unwilling to deal with, and he would like to see other people, you for instance, wallow in their situation just as he does. Do you think that's possible?
I guess.
Do you feel there is more progress to be made?
What?
Well, I wonder why.
But he won't.
That goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune.
What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
Well, why?
I can't believe you did that!!
I feel like I do.
Do I know you?
Talking.
Nothing.
You just want to ask me questions?
And that's all?
What did you think? Did it look like you expected?
Prettier than Ann?
I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me.
Cynthia, I don't think you want to, I mean, you should see the way he dresses. I really think he's in a bad way.
Oh.  Well, when, then?
How about inviting me over to dinner?
Hello.
Well, you know him, he's a friend of yours, do you think he can be trusted?
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
I just... Ann is very...
No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all.
I can't believe I let him stay in my house. Right under my nose. That deviant fucker was right under my nose and I didn't see him.
John, we have nothing to talk about.
Yeah, it's not bad. Usually Ann has some serious salt action going. I keep telling her, you can always add more if you want, but you can't take it out.
You were prying before?
Yes, this afternoon. I was grilling Ann about your marriage this afternoon.
What tapes?
He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
You knew these people?
Yeah, that's Dr. St. Luc. He's the head of our little medical clinic here.
Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.
We live in 703.
Yes? Who is there?
So who changes?
I don't get it.
I don't get it.
He didn't make it.
OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower, Starliner Towers. May as well go there directly.
GOT THE HOT FLUSH SYMPTOMS AND I'M FEELING FREAKY
A wreck.
What?
You got it!
Introduce yourselves.
We've been hearing some bad things about you, Brad.
How did you come by this scenario?
I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin.
In a way...
Conspiracy?  That sounds a little farfetched.
Overreact!  You're the one with theories about conspirac...  Oliver?
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
YOU'LL FIND A RAMBLING ROSE AND A PICKET FENCE
Oh, Harry.  What are we going to do?
Sure thing.
Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
You shouldn't have said that.
Why?
BUT WITHOUT YOU AND ME, SIS  THE WORLD'D FALL TO PIECES  VENA CAVA WHO'S THE RAVER?
I NEED SOME
You are the most desirable creature that ever walked.
F for...
Fabulous!
Fast!
F for...
Our speciality.
That's an extremely negative response.
This is the nerve center of operations, Janet.  You must stay here tonight.  That way we can all be here when Mr. Sun paints us a new day with his golden brush.
I FEEL THE HEAT FROM YOUR SKIN AND THE STUBBLE ON YOUR CHIN YOU'RE NO GOOD
OH ROMANCE IS NOT A CHILDREN'S GAME...
CRIMINAL
And we also know how you feel, we're not strangers to confusion.
You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.
I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
Really? Because I don't know, I was thinking that --
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
Huh.
Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
What are you pouring tonight?
Now there's a girl who knows how to pour. What's your name?
Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?
What happened to you guys?
Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit.
I can't help the traffic.
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
Why did you tell them my book was being published?
You still seeing that shrink?
Hey Jack, hurry up!
If that's what feels right.
Here's to my last week of freedom.
Well, she does know a lot about wine.
Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle.
Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
What?
And don't drink too much. I don't want you going to the dark side or passing out. Do you hear me? No going to the dark side.
Where were you?
I will.  See ya!
Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
Huh.
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
What is it?
You ever actually read any of this guy's books?
Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me.
You ever actually been in there, Miles?
Thanks.
Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
Me?
Come on, let me drive.
What the fuck!
I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
Hey, don't pull away till they see the car.
Maya, how are you?
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
I'm having the salmon.
Are you all right?
Hey.
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
Yeah. Thanks.
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
Okay. See you around.
Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
I had class.
Okay.
I've told him. I've told him over and over, but he's out of control.
Stephanie! Stop!
It was a surprise, Mom.
No.
This one?
This one?
It tastes funny.
...I will.
...I will.
And tell Merrill to swing away.
Explain, act crazy?
Just make noises then.
I cursed.
It was very dark.
That's a game isn't it?  Anyway...  There's been some interesting developments.
Should we make a run for it out the back?
He was only a year and half old.
That's good enough for me.
Graham.
What's two?
It does seem kind of odd doesn't it?
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me.
Is he okay?
They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.
That's why they got you in jail?
Weren't you going to come out to say good-bye?
You're not Baxter?
My name is Emmett.
Offend anybody lately?
Jefferson City?
I had to get up anyway.
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
Where you been?
A lot of men have told me that. Maybe it's true. I guess some women are slow to believe it.
Because they don't like what I want.
What's that?
Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
Get out of here, Jake.
You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
We'd rather stay.
We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.
Who did it?
This is it, gents. My ma told me to head south past that rock.
What is it you want from me?
What's she got to do with it?
Why'd you go into business with him?
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
Who's the owner?
What do you mean?
I like your attitude. But it can be risky.
It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Of course she is.  No other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her.
Elaine, she doesn't have any children!  Don't you see?  We're being held hostage by 12 men and 5 women who someone somewhere has decreed are the A-list.
It's the truth.  Those 17 superstars are our insurance policy.  We can't open -- can't make a profit without them.
Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
Listen, Viktor, I have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal.  This is business.
I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?
Where is she?
Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a press conference.
Viktor, it's my studio.
Viktor, we simply have to talk about "Eternity..."
Al least a contingency for wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a dress size.
No need.  She does all her own stunts.
That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?
Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
Soon.  Soon.
The premiere was the first time I've convinced her to venture out and it just confirmed her worst nightmares.
I do?
When is she coming over?
That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.
Not if I don't let her.
Every actor is an invention, Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles.
-- No, no, I didn't trip over her. You don't understand --
Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
Don't look so glum, Viktor.  It's not a death sentence.
Well, here I am.  You look pretty today.  Red suits you.
Mom, do you miss Dad?
God, it's so like your father.  Why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore?  I can almost forgive him for killing Simone -- but denying her existence.  I can never forgive that.
So you did meet her?
Thank God for you, Faith.  I know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.  You don't know what a service you're performing for Simone -- shielding her from those animals.
You're with me to be close to her?
How about the nudity?
It was more in passing.
You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions.
-- Please, get away from me.
I was misquoted.
It's me, Mr. Taransky.  Don't you recognize me? -- The Future of Film conference in San Jose. Hank... Hank Aleno.  I was keynote speaker.  You must remember my speech... "Who Needs Humans?"
Good for you, Hank.
Come on, Hank.  A synthespian, virtual actor -- ?
-- Flesh is weak.
That's the point, Hank.  No matter how good they are, they're still Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried. Everyone's failed.  It can't be done.
What's that?
You saw that?
She's at the premiere of "A Cold Day In Hell".  But I think she send someone from Acquisitions.
Can't you stop that?
How?
-- I know, I don't know anything.
One thing bothered me.
I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
She thinks you're with Simone.
I could get the death penalty.
What?!
I know what you're up to.
I've done my homework.  I've studied her.
-- I bet you have.
Shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes, every concierge and maitre d' on the take.  But this Simone woman is good.
My God, you've got one?
I don't understand.
-- Nicola!  How was your massage?
Thank you.  It's not important.
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
Thank you. It was a long time ago. I've kind of been retired for a while.  You're my very first client back.
We were supposed to draw a picture. Anything we wanted... I drew a man. He got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver.
I didn't know you were funny.
Can I ask you then?
Don't cry.
You really look better.
She came a long way to visit me, didn't she?
Really?
You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?
Yeah.
Someone got hurt.
They?
Dead people.
I would never think that about you... ever... Got it?
...He doesn't get invited places.
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
You ever hear of... the harvest of blood?
Witch.
Bitch.
Let me guess. We're going on a "long trip".
I happen to be a professional.
Suzie???
You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
Nike specials. Two hundred bucks.
Should we be doing this, dude?
"Old Macdonald... had --"
"And a slash-slash there --"
Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
This is his room... isn't it?
You got it wrong, boy. I'm not the monster you think.
Old slave superstition. You sprinkle a little blood mixed with water on the crops, you get yourself a good harvest... So they say.
It's time to make amends.
I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
Hey. Could you be a little more insensitive? We're on our way to a funeral for Crissake.
Bzzzzzzzzzt!
Shit!
Yeah?
Let it go.
Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?
Suzie --
You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
You sabotaged the bus! You kept us here... To die! First Keith, then Carl --
Like what?
CARL??? Carl did this?!!
Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.
Grant, where'd you go?
My father, he was -- he was real close to evil. People didn't know. Still don't. From the time I was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. I don't mean just like a smack for smart--mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse. Starla looks at Bill, who seems struck.
When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
What's she see in that douchebag?
He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.
Hey there, Chief.
Sure thing, killer.
Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
It's just a work thing.
Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm not in the mood. Grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy. GRANT Come on, baby, it's --
Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
I got a boy running in the Peach Tree Classic tomorrow and when he wins, I wanna celebrate in style.
Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
Okay. I was in Texas dancing in an industrial show for Sunkist Oranges. They say I'm the new Anita Bryant. But I'm really a dancer from New York. A lot of credits. Moderate talent.  Anyway, after opening night, I was walking back to the motor lodge and suddenly there he was. A tall Texan with a twenty-nine inch waist. Pure dynamite.
Kate McConnell.
You have a great profile.
Seriously?!?
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
How do you know?
Kate...
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
-- Actually, my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named Ramblin' Bobby Holt. When I turned twenty- one, I went to Europe with visions of being free and independent. My luck, he was on the plane. I landed in Paris and fell in love before I could claim my baggage.  We were together for almost a year. I thought he was it.
Go.
If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.
Let's get the hell outta here.
Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
She's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. Might I remind you this was your brainstorm.
What's your twenty?
Then don't.
You're coming up to the scale house.
Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.
Breaker. Breaker.
Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.
Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
Bandit II. We'll be back on the highway in a second. Over.
That crazy sumbitch made it.
-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
-- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana Peel.
Yes, but no -- we have personnel stationed at both ends of that hall, twenty-four hours a day.
How bad?
Mortal.
-- Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he now?
You're sure?
And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --
You investigating those murders out at the lake?
Thass' right.  I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.
Are you on a land line?
-- Jack, what am I doing? I'm standing here, aren't I?  Shouldn't that be enough? That I made the trip?
I dunno... Cinnamon roll?
Do you want me to say I did it?
...I'm sorry...
Y'ain't never had to wash another man's blood off, dig it out y'fingernails... Y'had us for that. Y'ain't ever made a real beef on y'own, shit as light in the ass as you are, I'll bet you ain't ever made anything more than a fuck'n fist your whole life.  So if you think I'mma let your lil' punk-ass, with the dirt I've done for you, in the eleventh hour, sell me off like some fucking field nigger, hand me up to the Feds like y'last chip, then you done gone straight out-your-motherfucking MIND!
I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished.
My debrief --
-- will be handled back in --
...A paternity suit, filed 1967...
...Are you insane?
You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
...So you made another deal?
Alright, now Buzzy -- this is, this is it, here, okay, so listen to me careful and wait till I'm finished 'cuz we got no room for slop.
-- he's doing it then, huh --
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.
-- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
Yeah, I can front this.
Fuckin' thrilled t'hear it. So the scout, the sitdown, y'musta felt it from 'em then huh?
Bag this fucker Buzzy.
Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.
The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.
Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.
I want to hear your version.
I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation.  Now: What happened to him?
She'll come back.
No, she won't.
It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me.
He's dead.
Is there anybody else here?
I wish you'd told me.
Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed.
Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean?  I don't think so.
Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying.  Consciousness should be enough for anybody.
Just get him to stop.
I'll go with you.
And tonight?
And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening.  Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on?  Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
What do you remember?
Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive.  We had to unlearn everything.
What happened?
Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling.
You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it.
He has a point.
Yes.  Yes.
What's wrong.
I'm sure there are worse people to talk to, but I don't know who they are.
I love you.
No.
You're lying.
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
Who are you, then?
We thought you'd be alone.  We want to talk about...
They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. They are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual.
A recoil, with no compensating mechanism.
You want it coming back with us?
I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee.
I guess I'm supposed to do it in the morning.  Identify him.
Sooner, the better.
Yeah.
I can't open it.
Let go!
Not exactly.
Do you?
... Mike.
So.
Ellie, you know I think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own.  We can afford it now.
Okay?
Why?
Ellie, it was a formal party...
Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
I heard a lot... Anything you want to deny, Mike?
No One-Seventeen, they'll fuck it up!  He told me not to tell anybody, to bring Claire and come alone!  He won't wait, he knows I'm two minutes away!  Koontz, please!
Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave.
Hold it...!
My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
God!  Scrambled eggs surprise?! These are pickles...!  God!
Tommy!  The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't sing.
Here you go, Pete.
No, no, listen. They're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
Lizzy!
Mistake?  Hey, guy, get back here!
A little bunny I saved from dissection.
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
Jesus Christ.
Lemme down, bugface!
How are you doing, kid?
Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
Frmpph-yrr.
I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
Some things you should say anyway.
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
Oh, don't do it on my account--
This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
-- but at least Aunt May's okay now. I really have to stop by the hospital this afternoon.
You're not trained for that.  None of us are... I mean, sometimes I...  Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then?  Are you bulletproof?
You'd feel what?
Peter?
But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
You sure about all this?
--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
A match made in heaven.
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
Ha.  Anti-gravitational particles.
Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
Actually, I got this spider bite
The paper, my boy.  A solid B-plus.
Oh. Yeah.  Thanks.
Why? It is a wrestling match, or
So they're airing this tonight?
A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In  his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely.
Do you... live around here?
No, but I've got this secret identity to worry about. I'll swing the rest of the way.
Professor, you ever fly one of these things before?
How did he ever find out about that ammunition train?
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
They ought to be under the barbed wire soon.
Private property, bub.
Brother, were we all wet about you!
Come on, Schulz! Spill it! How did you get the information? About Manfredi and Johnson? About the stove and the tunnel? Who's giving it to you? Which one of us is it?
That's the general idea.  Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.
Yeah.
Ever try forty sleeping pills?
You have no idea how boring my life here is. If it weren't for an occasional air raid or some foolish prisoners trying to escape, I wouldn't know what to do. I want to thank you for keeping me company. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't read. I hate music. That only leaves good conversation. It will be a shame to lose you.
I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
Say, Schulz --
Sprechen Sie deutsch?
Hey, Schulz! I got a deal for you. Suppose you help us escape. We'll go home and have everything ready for you in Madison Square Garden. For the world championship! Schulz, the Beast of Bavaria versus Halitosis Jones!
Good morning, Animal! What'll it be for breakfast? Scrambled eggs with little sausages? Bacon and eggs sunny- side up? Griddle cakes? A waffle?
Hey -- Russki -- Russki! Look at those bublichkis! Over here!
Let me go! Let me go!
You're teasing me again!
Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
She'll never forgive me!
It's that song, Harry!
Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.
If you can't get the BBC, how about getting Guy Lombardo?
You told them, Hoffy.
I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
What time?
Say, Schulz -- you guys had machine gun practice last night?
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
Wunderbar! Maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife. But there is a piano teacher in the village --
The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
I do not want those cigarettes.
Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
All right, gentlemen! We will now all go outside for a little gymnastic and take some shovels and undig the tunnel which you digged.
So you're stuck with me, eh?
You heard him.
Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space. It's a doorway. It leads to another place- the Nexus. It doesn't exist in our universe and it doesn't play by the same rules either.
Yes, where would you go?
You're right. I'll need help.  Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
Close to retirement?
I'm not going  Scotty, help me with this chute.
And what would that be, sir?
Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.
I thought you might.
Keep her together until I get back.
We learn something new about ourselves every day.  Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.
I'm afraid I can't just leave it at that. The commanding officer of this ship is clearly distraught about something. As ship's counselor, it's my duty to-
You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.
My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
The timing is very important on my experiment- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost.
You must think I'm quite the madman.
I've spent eighty years looking for another way, Captain. This is the only one.  Of course, you could always come with me. You fancy yourself an explorer. Here's a chance to explore something no human has ever experienced.
We're all mortal, Soran. It's one of the truths of ou existence.
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
It is a Class D-12 Bird of Prey. They were retired from service because of defective plasma coils.
Nothing. As before.
Sir... Something's jamming our transmission. An energy surge.
David, I don't understand...
Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
... Fascinating.
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
I'll handle that later.
.          .. Spock's tube...
My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.
It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.
Captain... the logical alternative is obvious... beaming down to the surface is permitted...
Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now.
Mr. Scott, all power to the weapons systems --
Mr. Scott: two photon torpedoes at the ready. Sight on the center of the mass.
Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.
And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
My God...
The word, sir?
Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours, present speed.
That distortion is closing rapidly... Opinion, Sulu?
Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere... I am going to kill one of the prisoners.
No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.
Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
I -- saw no future --
You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was "in death," Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him.
Yes, I was...
Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
Then, how --
... The needs of the many outweigh...
What you ask is difficult.
What about Spock?
Share this with no one.
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
They outnumber us, my Lord --
1,000 Kellicams, closing!
You amaze me, Commander.
How is that...?
A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space.
Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
That's all you have to say?
Uh -- what are they?
Don't mince words, Bones; tell me what you really think.
It never rains but when it pours --
I've got the sick bay ready. Will someone please tell me what is going on?
There may still be time... you gave as good as you got.
They even killed the galley chief.
Until now.
Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days.
En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened?  <u>Has something happened</u>? Do you read us?
Why? Why didn't you tell me?
Are you sure these are the coordinates?
<u>Botany Bay</u> -- oh no!
But the child --
He left us.  We were no longer of use. SAAVIK Where is  the Reliant crew? Dead?
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
Where's Dr. Marcus --
No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
Let go -- he can't -- !
Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens.
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
The energizer's bypassed like a Christmas tree -- so don't give me too many bumps.
Yes, SIR.
There's a first time for everything, Admiral.
Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
Carol Marcus --
All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.
Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power...
Kirk here.
Any suggestions, Admiral?
Permission to speak candidly, sir?
I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
I failed to resolve the situation.
Indeterminate life signs.
It doesn't make sense. These coordinates are well within Regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless.
If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground.
Mr. Saavik, all stop.
Understood, sir.
As you were, Mr. Saavik.
Prepare for warp speed.
Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all moorings.
Certainly...
Spock... The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings. But as my son, you have them. They will surface.
Where must you go?
To Earth. To offer testimony.
I do this because I was there,
You -- sent them away. Without even letting me say goodbye?
That's crazy!
It doesn't look all that different.
He's coming 'round, Jim...
Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
Angels and ministers of grace, defend us.
No choice now, Scotty!
Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.
You sure you won't change your mind?
They are mature humpbacks, weighing 45,000 pounds each. They wandered into San Francisco Bay as calves and were brought here. We call them George and Gracie.
I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
LDS?? Are you dyslexic on top of everything else? Come on, Lemme give you a lift. I have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that's why I work with whales.
They're gonna hafta take their chances.
No, ma'am. No dipshit.
We can't tell you.  Please, just -- let me finish. I can tell you that we're not in the military and that we intend no harm to the whales.
Or believe, I'll bet.
Thanks. Cheers.
If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?
... Who are you?
Think about it -- but don't take too long because I'm out of time. If you change your mind, this is where I'll be.
But Kirk...
Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
... What does that mean?
I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
Hey! -- Where you going?!
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?
Thank you, Admiral.
Spock -- you're suggesting the transmission is meant for life form other than man?
Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated?
But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.
But you said toxic.
Yes?
What else did you learn from your mind meld?
Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
Admiral, may I suggest that Dr. McCoy is correct. We must help Chekov.
What is our condition?
Ready sir.
Sir -- I've got some back pressure on manual --
Estimate range, ship to whales!
Scotty, how long is this bay?
Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks.
Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
Full power, sir.
The whales...?!
The explosive override -- ?
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
I am well, Admiral.
I will. Can my assistant come, too?
I notice you're still working with polymers.
That's the ticket, laddie.
But not you.
The craftsmanship is extraordinary.
My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's.
But I can run much faster than you... I am capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second...
Androids... don't have...fun.
Anij!
I have to go home now.
Can he breathe under water?
Won't he rust?
Captain, the Son'a hostages declined to be examined. I had them confined to quarters.
Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village...
Will the structure hold if we blast through?
Your Federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be...
Your self-restraint puzzles me, Admiral. You continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer...
Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force.
That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...
What kind of concerns?
How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...
With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve...  I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?
What you're asking me to do... is impossible... the crew is loyal to Ru'afo...
No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...
Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.
Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector.  Do you have a problem with those orders?
The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
We're pulling it like a zipper across space...
Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...
They're powering their forward weapons array.
Sir?
Sir, if we fire a tachyon burst, it may force him to reset his shield harmonics. When he does, we could beam him out...
The Ba'ku could use some rest, sir. According to the geo-scan, this may be the safest area for the next few kilometers...
One. It's Ru'afo.
We've downloaded all the files on the duck blind mission as well as intelligence reports on the Son'a.
No children?
Why don't you try sitting up?
Sir, I am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels...
Your scanners must be malfunctioning.
Good hunting. Hayes out.
Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
You actually performed surgery...?
Um... yeah.  Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
I do not know what you are referring to.
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
I've deactivated the sensory inputs. That flesh on your body is just meat, now.
Isn't it better like this...?
Dispersive armor is holding.
I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...
"APR cell count?" What the hell are you talking about?
Alphanumeric lock. We need a password to get in...
Maybe...  Sure. Yeah. As long as I could get a clear look at the intake configuration. But so far, we haven't found any other photos.
Captain... we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system. We've got to go <U>now</U>.
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot...
There's no temporal shielding in here! We're starting to pick up relativistic effects!
It'll be tight, but we should make it.
Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force.  And you are?
Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
"Money." So you can get dome money...
You're lying.
I'd say you already have.
We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --
Incoming transmission from the Borg.
Captain, there are five Borg ships closing in on our position.
Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister La Forge and a security team meet me in Transporter Room Three. Civilian clothes.
Looks like they damaged the silo...
We have to stop them from sending that message.
Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.
What are you suggesting?
We're not finished.
- <U>Kobayashi Maru</U>...
That was the general idea I intended to convey.
Specifically of...?
Still think we're finished?
What kind of creature is this? Last night you two were spooning -
Time we got underway ourselves, gentlemen.  Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
Isn't it a fact that you served Romulan ale, a beverage illegal in the Federation because of its overwhelming potency?
There... were no other ships in the sector.
An INCIDENT?
Thank you, Captain.
We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
Your research laboratory is most impressive...
What took you so long?
He's got it.
Possibly.
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
Sorry -
I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked.
Me?
There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
I'M going. You are going to be responsible for getting me out of this. Meantime we're not going to be the instigators of a full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
The peace conference.
WE SURRENDER.
It's pretty chaotic over there. There's been some weapons fire and a lot of shouting...
You have done well, Saavik. As your sponsor at the Academy I have followed your career with... satisfaction. And as a Vulcan.
You must have faith.
Very well. For twenty-four hours we'll agree that this conversation did not take place.
You having hearing problems, mister?
A computer canna lie, sir.
They dinna fire on themselves. And there were no other ships present.
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
This one can.
I assume command of this ship as of  0130 hours. Uhura, send to Starfleet HQ. Explain precisely what has taken place, and request instructions.
And they'd be right. We have no evidence - just a theory that happens to fit the facts...
Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation?
For how long?
They're running me ragged. Nothing but question day and night... I love it! Come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it. There's a Bajoran band at the officer's mess.
The final signature is approx- imately 300 meters up that incline.
Data to Captain Picard. Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access. And, I believe, we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage.
Good work. The download?
A bit less florid, Data.
What do you imagine this is?
I do not agree. Although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created unique individual.
It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
If you wouldn't mind.
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy. What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow.
Captain -- I might have a way to find them.
Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance?
Do you have life support?
This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies.
Geordi... prepare the shuttle- bay for arrivals. They don't know our procedures so just... open the doors.

 Believe me, we don't under- stand it either. You're the closest ship so I want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say. Get the lay of the land, If the Empire becomes unstable, it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant.
It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system.
Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
I think it's worth a look. Don't worry, Number One, we'll get you to Betazed with time to spare.
A coup d'etat?
She's not out for a pleasure cruise.
I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
I want to end the centuries of mistrust. I want to be your ally, not your enemy. As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas.
Yes.
Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us.
What happened?
Were we always explorers?
If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned.
Hello, Jean Luc.
What are you doing?
And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma?
Not so long.
He's a very unusual android.
Intruder alert!
This is a mistake.
Praetor...
How many Warbirds will you need?
I thought we discussed patience, Commander.
I don't see anything.
How much are your rooms?
I'll have to run your card off now.
Make any money?
Thank you.
There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?
Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.
It's in a green Mustang?
Clarify that.
I don't like it, George...
I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
What's all this for?
We'll do that. But how are we going to hold him? He can change himself into a man. He can disappear.
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
Mrs. Haydn...
Please...
Steering wheel...
Steering wheel.
Smile.
No gas.
Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I?  Who are you?
Space?
Who?
Shit?
No.
You. Mouth closed.
It was yellow.
That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't...
I need you.
Do you have a baby?
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
What is hitchhike?
Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take...  ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'...
Your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride.
Don't be afraid. Do what I told you and you'll be okay.
Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me...  Goodbye.
Jennyhaydn.
Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
You did? That's funny. So did we.
We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship...
He was a good friend... The captain took the ship away fast and I was not in the ship.
I like this music.
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
I feel better if I move.
Asshole!!
What are you saying?
You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.
Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
You want the baby to laugh at me.
I'm sure we could find a country and western station.
Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...
Slow down, slow down.
Pull over. I've got to get back there.
That's because the ones that were hurt, died. They couldn't talk to you.
Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
There's nothing... No reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... Seems like a totally isolated incident.
Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
Judy, that's stupid.
You know that's impossible!
Come on, let's go, I got to get back.
Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
We have nothing to talk about, Lenny.
Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news.  An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?
You can't just... kill him.
I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
Jesus.
I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for free.'
Forget it's there.
It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
What?  He gonna record you on his label?
Damn right.
Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it.
We should talk alone.
So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
I can get you what you want.  You just have to talk to me.  I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious.  You say it, you even think it, you can have it.  You want a girl, you want two girls?  I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy?  You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up?  It's all doable.
Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks.  And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal.  You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring!  Let me buy you a drink.
You should feel like shit.
So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max.
Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.
Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
What do you mean?
2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her.
Where's Faith?
How did you hook up with Faith?
I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.
Who was just here?
Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.
Lenny, this shit's illegal.
I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.
No, you're just trying to get off.
Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.
I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.
Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.
Jesus, Mace.  Back off.
Is this great fabric or what?
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?
That's where it gets a little strange.
And what about the guy that was following me?
Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!
There's a plus side?
You never told me.
Mace... you're a girl.
Got your ticket?
You see Tran?
Oh boy.  What if you're wrong?
Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back.  Is that...?
I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
You tell me.
Hey, Sheriff.
Tape it off, we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in, pays, picks up the key, but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
Whole country or just hereabouts?
What?
Excuse me?
I've been looking for you.
The man who was with him, he was a construction worker?
What about his killer?
You have the photo from the diner?
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.
I'll take it into consideration.
I don't believe this.
"Was?"
We're waiting for trace evidence results on the Rice killing.
Dick Low's a killer too.
You better hope the Director doesn't stop abruptly one day, David, you might break your nose.
You're a disgrace to law enforcement, to the Bureau -- and to me.
How long have you been downtown?
Doesn't fit.
And who kills in the manner of his victim.
Yes I do.
Take it to the next level. What are his fantasies, what turns him on, what kind of pornography does he like? If he could act out his fantasies, what would he do? Imagine yourself one of his victims, realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking?
Why did Koessler assign you as my liaison?
Because you asked him to, stupid.
What did you tell him?
No. Cut off while he was still alive, look at his wrists, damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free. Must have been screaming real loud when the killer chain-sawed his throat. Unfortunately, he'd soundproofed his van.
No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
Start killing people for real?
You were right. He found me.
They say Richard Low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead.
Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as "burn residue." Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection.
Unlock these cuffs.
You knew it was me all along?
There's someone out there, Mack, I know, some man killing for the fun of it, sniffing human glue, without regard to age or sex, without predicable M.O. Someone who has a way to dispose of the bodies. You have access, you can call up local authorities, check morgues, conduct interviews. Be my man.
[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
[You tell me.]
[What does the file say?]
"Computer Investigation and Infrastructure Assessment Center." Quantico out of MIT -- you're a techie?  Okay, you screwed up once. So did half the guys here. That's why they're here.
Agent Mackelway, you want to get off your ass and do something for a change?
Yes, sir.
Headed there now. The same shift will be on at noon.
He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you.
You've been through worse.
What do you drive?
I'm sorry?
You like laughing at the misery of others?
Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago.
I thought real men don't like quiche.
What else?
Anything.
...not until you book it...
They're out of Glenlivet.
I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
What do you guys do?
Why not?
You're a comedian?
Why, you like the duck with the cigar? 
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
...Nah. I'm right across the street...
...well, it suits you...
Yeah, hold on.
You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back.
...Six months.
Yeah.
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
So what's the difference?
So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.
Unless she comes back first.
No problem.
Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now.
You want to hit the town tonight?
I don't know. Eight or Nine.
So, if the party starts at eight, why are we first going to a bar at ten?
Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts.
What's that guy's name? Sue?
..."A Boy Named Sue". I think that's why he's such a bad cat.
You want to talk about it?
You little bitch!
It's kinda money, actually.
Big butt... you know, can't fly coach.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Hi, Nikki. Mike. I don't think this is working out. I think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. It's not you, really. It's me. It's only been six months...
Are you ready to order?
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
What Vegas?
When?
I can't lose more than a hundred.
No, seriously, if you're dressed nice and you act like you gamble a lot, they give you free shit.
Whu?
This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.
They're all skanks.
I know, but...
...Well, you know, not counting the first table.
Baby, don't talk like that, baby.
Did she, or did she not smile.
What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
It's just that I've been out of the game so long. Trent, I was with her for six years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know...
It's just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new... who doesn't know what I like... and you gotta wear a jimmy...
I know. I know.
...It's just, I thought "Renaissance" was too Excaliber, it's the wrong casino. She would've gotten it, though...
We didn't do so bad after all.
Whatever.
Oh... a Dorothy.
Oh... "I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad..." Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother.
No!
Wait...  She's crying. I finish. I hold up my finger like "Wait a second". They sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. I look up and they all start clapping, and now they're all crying. Even the camera guy.
...So give me the fuckin part...
No, man. I need to use the phone.
What?
Christy was nice...
She really didn't do it for me, baby. How'd you like Dorothy?
She thought you were money.
I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
That was different.
I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing?
I wish the game still had fights so I could bitch-slap Wayne.
This version doesn't have fighting?
What a surprise.
Please, don't mess with me right now...
How long do I wait to call?
I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good.
Because he's a bitch.
No.
...double diamond...
You're like this big bear with claws and fangs...
...and fangs... and you're like "I don't know what to do. How do I kill this bunny?"...
...Tomorrow, then a day.
Laugh all you want, but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who's ready to party.
An eye for an eye!
Be my friend.
I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...
Outside.
I'll think about it.
Why do you come to me?  Why do I deserve your generosity?
Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.
Can I do something for you still? You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you?
What is this nonsense?
My wife was weeping before she fell asleep, outside my window I saw my caporegimes to the house, and it is midnight.  So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows.
Tom, I never thought you were a bad Consigliere, I thought Santino a bad Don, rest in peace.  He had a good heart but he wasn't the right man to head the family when I had my misfortune.  Michael has all my confidence, as you do.  For reasons which you can't know, you must have no part in what will happen.
I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know.
I'll need him.
That is your birthright...but Michael, use this car.
How do you know I come from America?
Get the car.  I'll be leaving in ten minutes.  Where's Calo?
This one could seduce the devil.  A body! and eyes as big and black as olives.
Mike!
No, and I've been calling all night. Maybe he's shacked up.
What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno?
What was that?
Will you give this to him.
Will you give this letter to Michael.
Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him.  I really needed him.
No.  His name is Luca Brasi.  You wouldn't like him.
You know I love spaghetti.
Then Luca turned to the other man...
Michael, I love you.
We have something for your mother, for Sonny, we have the tie for Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the Reynolds pen...
Michael, what are you doing?
Hello.  Kay?
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
Send some bodyguards.
Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better.
You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie?
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine.
Now you know why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast. It's not love it's the coffee machine.
Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.
Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We thought you'd disappeared. We were going to send out a search party.
I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them.
Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
What?
I'm never going back!
No, I think your mother, her illness --
I love jazz.
Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat --
I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.
I have to go to Venice.
What?
I didn't mean with you in it.
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
Hello?
Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly.
Freddie, do you have something to say?
What about Cortina?
Where's Dickie?
I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days.
I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
Why? When?
What?
That's why Tom wanted you to stay. It's better than squeezing into my room, and I know how you hate hotels.
What's your secret?
I'm Meredith, by the way. Meredith Randall.
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
Emily.  Just kidding.
As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too.
Randall.
How did you know that?
Is Freddie in Rome?
Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R.
I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?
Dickie, my God!
Just kidding. Are you alone?
Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in seguito alla negativa valutazione delle disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con il mio predecessore Roverini che come e noto non e riuscito a impedire il verificarsi della scomparsa del signor Greenleaf, il quale era l'unica persona al momento passibile di incriminazione del reato di omicidio del signor Miles.
Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long?
Not at all. Morning Tom.
No.
Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do.
Hardly kissing. Kissing off.
Why lie?
What do you mean lied about who you are?
Senta. We have to ask you to stay in Rome.
Postmortem?
Even your fiance...?
Even her.
I have!
Absolutely.
Is that so?  But what do you think of Charles Palantine?
Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
Why?
I don't know...
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
That would have been quite a coincidence.
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
Oh. Who was that again?
You didn't have to spend your money -- ?
No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
How are you, Travis? I read about you in the papers.
Tom, come here a moment.  I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county.  And don't forget to add the new photo releases.
Just didn't get around to it, huh?
Well, if Cronkite's so great, why don't we run him instead?
Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos...
He's Black, OK?
What is it? I'm busy.
Awh, come off it, Pal.
Could you see anything?
Threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out -- What do you think!  What do I have to do? Draw you a picture?
Sure. What do you think? She wanted to get out of the cab. I said "Look, you're in the middle of the fucking bridge..."
What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
Huh?
20 bucks?
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!
You can do it in my mouth.
Do you understand why I came here?
I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
I can leave anytime I want.
But you can't live like this. It's hell. Girls should live at home.
I can't say -- it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time.
Do I look like a narc?
Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once.
I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
Have you tried the telephone?
Why, thank you Travis.
I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much.
So whatja do now?
I ride around nights mostly. Subways, buses. See things. Figur'd I might as well get paid for it.
Honorable discharge. May 1971.
Are you a Secret Service Man?
Is that so?
You would, huh?
My name is Henry Krinkle -- that's with a "K." K-R-I-N-K-L-E. I live at 13 1/2 Hopper Avenue, Fair Lawn, New Jersey. Zip code 07410.  Got that?
I'm no cop.  I want some action.
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
Real down.
Like do anything, you know.
What do you expect, Bertrand Russell? I've been a cabbie all my life, what do I know?  I don't even know what you're talking about.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Hey!  Now there's some good news.
He says he's leaving the island sir.
Surprise, surprise.
Womack ripped it up, right?
Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much.
Tell them Pete.  Tell them...
Yeah, well it's not everyday you get  news like this.  You're sure he's  okay?  Other than the  bump on the head?
Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in?  I'll be right down.
No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
I do?
City hall?
You first.
No, you are.  I know exactly what you mean.  It's not that you're missing something.  It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along.
This is strange.  Do you feel it?
It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
Nine hundred...
I don't smoke?
Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet.  You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder.  So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.
Delly, shhhhhh...
Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?
Yes.  A prepared statement.
Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?
Cecil!  Cecil, there's a young man in there...
Tomorrow afternoon...  ... oh my god...
Or the Bijou.  Either one.
Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town.
Thanks.
Excuse me... what's your, um, your name?
When did I leave?
Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
Yes?
Ha!
The film broke...
Did you... did you...
Zackly.
She's very pretty.
Evening, Luke.
Can we get him to the hospital?
Don't smell nothin'.  He must not be dead in here.
Who the hell is this "they?"
No.  Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did.  Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor.  I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em.  I didn't believe in what they were saying.  Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying!
I was decorated.
Well, that's a relief.  I understand they usually don't let that stop them.
Luke didn't smoke.
Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?
That you got let go.
He was, but he got sick.  We got a new director today.  Why?
Who?
Yes?
The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.
Yes.
Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
I think I'll have some of that, too.  I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know.  And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia.
With Lydia.  Did she seem a trifle distant?
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
I see.
No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
I did.
That's up to you.
Are you coming to my party?
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
The little Brenner girl.
It's Alice, ain't it?
See where I'm pointing?
The front door.  Isn't there a back road I can take?
You see, I wanted to surprise them.
Mmmmmm.  'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do.
Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to understand. This young lady says there was an attack on the school.
Let me have some apple pie, Helen.  Who said anything about war? All I said was that some gulls...
How do you do, Miss Daniels?  Acknowledge a what?
I know, Mother.
Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.  I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.
I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch?
Mitch...
I started to say... inside...
Then he saw.
I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
And if you don't?
Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
Does this room look silly?
Yes. I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?
Bodega Bay? Where's that?
Sixty...  Oh.
Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir?
Aren't these lovebirds?
Ahhh, but I know you.
Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
Do you practice here?
I'm sorry.  Who's your friend?
Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.
Why would I want to see you, of all people?
I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
Right next to the one you already had.
Yes.
No.
You were lying.
I told you what happened in Rome!
Cheers.
What's in this? Nitro-glycerin?
And Fridays? What do you do then?
I'll take Cathy up to bed.
Well, they'll go along with anything.
And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!
It's so damn quiet out there.
Melanie, Melanie...
No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.
How soon?
No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
Yes, all right, I'll wait for you. Good-by. 
Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait all that time to start a... a war against humanity?
Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
Not if they're starting a war.
That's right, sir, I recall it. A large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town, where all the lights were.
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
Of course.
Georgina told me how kind you were to her.  It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
You have his promise, then?
I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
He could have been a great man -- a good man and a fine doctor, but there was always the shame of the old life and the old ways to hold him back -- and always Gray -- Gray to hound him to his death.
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
I thought only the best students were made assistants.
You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
Yes, I suppose so.
What do you mean, Fettes?
You've no thought of going there?
Where shall we put it? In the back?
Not yet.
He was a nice horse.
Don't you want to find the white horse, Georgina?  You can't find him from a wheelchair.  You have to walk and run to find him.
The nerve centers -- the brain --
I've ordered nothing from you.
What I was going to say is this -- wouldn't you be more comfortable at Leith in a neat little house?
I would make you rich.
But why, Gray? Why?
I never heard that song. But what did they do?
But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
I'm looking for my friends.
How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
Was that it? Well, ok.
Two down. Two to go.
Think maybe knives do?
Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
I watched her grow up. Just like you. I know how her mind worked. She kept snooping around because she was worried about you. What you'd gotten yourself into. So stop blaming me. And blame yourself.
If you had a license, I bet I'd have seen it by now. How old are you? Fifteen?
Why are there so many?
That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
You're in with them.
You killed her!
How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
I would like to explain something of my mission here.
We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.
The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this. They must understand what is at stake.  You mentioned a demonstration of force--
Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.
Of course, dear.
Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?
Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
Where is that?
All right.
No foolin'? Will you?
Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter.
I -- I'm not sure I understand--
My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth.
Good afternoon.  I'm glad to see you up and around.
Thank you... Have you any news?
Now that you understand the situation more clearly, perhaps you'd like to discuss the matter with the President
Well, we could--
I wonder if we ought to--
Are you crazy? After what happened today?
Everyone seems so-- 
Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?
Mr. Carpenter, I--  Goodnight.
I -- I didn't really pay much attention--  Bobby has such an active imagination.
What is it you want?
What happened?
Just twelve.
It must be twelve-thirty.
I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me.
I don't like horror comics.
<u>I'll</u> have to drive!
We don't ride with vampires.
We've been aware of some very serious vampire activity in this town for a long time.
All together?
They're looking at us.
<u>Four</u> to go.
We were gonna grab some food.
Get yourself a good sharp stake and drive it through his heart.
Oh, no...
Don't go out there!  Stop him!
You have a T.V.?
I like Michael.
No.  I'm up.
Sure.
He met a girl.
Where's Michael?
In here?
Oh, no.  Now what?
But, Mom...
Not impressed, are you?
He doesn't walk all over me.
Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.
When?
Why not?
I know, I've felt it...
I'm so excited I just can't hide it.  I'm about to lode control and I think I like it.
I was here first.
Do I have to do this?
What's the matter?
Sixteen.
Pretty nasty out, Mac.  Thirty-five knots.
Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that!
Auxiliary light cables...?  Been cut.
Somebody broke in.
Lighten your load, sucker.  You ain't the judge and executioner around here!
I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.
MacReady!
Could be important work.  Might as well bring it back.
Hold on, damn it.  We're getting nowhere... If this bit of Blair's about absorbing and imitating is true... then that dog could have gotten to anybody.
How far's that?
How many in their party?
Put that down!
Get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles.
Pure nonsense.  This won't prove a damn thing.
Oh, I got you.  Not too long.
Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.
What kind of test?
This storm do that?
Where was he trying to go?
You and Nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.
Maybe it ain't coming.
Magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy.  And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.
Yeah!
You hear that?
You have books?!  Kalen, you've got to take me there.  There might be history.  Records.  Something to help us find where the Morlocks took --
My God... I saw this.
So, do we go on?
Vox --
Nothing to do, I'm afraid.  I'm just a librarian after all.  Wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling.  Very Byronic end, though.  I appreciate that.  Do you know Byron?
I won't leave you like this.
I don't understand.
How?
What?
Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw.  Why would you come back to this?  To save a few cattle?  No.
Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
You promised me flowers.
Well there's something new.
You know, the moment is rather dying here.
Let's walk through the park...
... The point is I know it will work once the, um, numbers and such are in order.
Do you know you were humming?
Where's the challenge in that?
The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand.
I'm sorry, David.
It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.
What happened to Emma will never go away.  It's part of you now and it always will be.  But you have to learn to live with it...
I know that --
I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you.
Thank you...
Is there a lot of illness?
That machine --
Good night, then.
Yes.
I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
You lost someone.
So you can use it now?
Alexander, take my son away.  Take him back to your time.  Will you do that?
Kalen...
Mara -- what -- ?!
Imagine that.
Good morning, Alexander.  Feeling up to some work?
You supported his application, Dr. Philby.  You are his senior, advisor.  I depend upon you to restrain his... excesses.  Any repetition of the behavior I witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both.
Yes, sir.
We'll see about that.
I have no doubt of that.  I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it.  Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?
Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
And what's that?
My business?
Who are you?
[Beat] You're his son?
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
How?
But I like it I guess.
Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification.
How'd he die?
How? Did they figure it out after I died?
Of course it makes me mad. It makes me more than mad. Just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him. But what's it gonna do for me to find them now? I can't fix everything in three days.
They're not.
Then why isn't there anyone around?
No, he didn't.
I've been ok.
I guess I'd ask you why.
Because I don't think I'm crazy.
How'd he get it?
Come on. Tell me what you do know.
Some part of you suspects -- even if you don't know for sure -- that what I'm saying is true.
I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up.
It's gonna be sticky.
I'm not sure.
[Beat] I was dropped off.
Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you?
No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink?
I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if...
But hey, who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman -- that she be warm and happy. How hard can that be to remember?
Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
How?
You want anything special for dinner?
... only for one day and we'll be back tomorrow night.
What?
Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids.  I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.
Well, you'd best get something. Even if they didn't do it, it times out that they most likely witnessed it.  I want somebody to at least talk to 'em.  Put out an APB with a description and see what we get back.
Armed robber.
We don't have a whole lotta choice, do we?  I can't figure out if they're real smart or just really, really lucky.
Oh shit.
What for?
Louise, is that you?
I always knew that.
Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
You're in Oklahoma?!
Not yet.
Tell me now.
I got it.  I was afraid I'd missed you.  I almost couldn't get a check cashed.  It's Saturday.
Peaches.
In the back?
He already thinks you're out of your mind, Louise, that don't carry much weight with Darryl.  Are you at work?
Whose place is this again?
Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
Get the car.
Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, I think we should tell the police.
Which part?
Our next move?  I'll say one thing, Louise.  This is some vacation.  I sure am having a good time.  This is real fun.
I'm cash poor.
Why are you actin' like this?
You could help me try and figure it out!  I gotta figure out what to do, and you could try and help me.
I suggested we go to the police, but you didn't like that; so, frankly, Louise, I'm all out of ideas.
You're not touchin' that car.
My stuff's in the trunk!  God!  You care more about that car than you do about most people.
But you think he fools around.
What did Darryl say?
So what are you gonna tell him?
Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he?
What's wrong with you?
Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.
You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend.  You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.
So what's the plan, Thelma?  You just gonna stay drunk?
Why not?!
You know those little dogs you see people with?
Like a Chihuahua?
I can see that.
Thelma!
Sorry!
You do?
That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass.
Louise?
He said they're charging us with murder.
Louise, do you think we should change cars, get another car?
We can change our names.
We should head a little further in. There's not that many roads in this state.  I want to try to hit Mexico somewhere not so close to New Mexico.  They probably wanna kill us in New Mexico.
You know what's happened, don't you?
Shit!
Why?
You too, sweetie, the best.
Go.
We been seein' you all along the way.
You women are crazy!
Say you're sorry.
We're fine!  How are you?
Oh, Jesus!
Gay? He said you were gay?
What's the point? Let's face it, Dom, I'm in a slump.  Lately I've been feeling like... well... like a loser.
It must be great with a wife like that.
Nah.
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
Hey, look on the bright side --
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
What's so funny?
Mary's a babe!
Huh? But why did Healy?
I don't know what to say.
Mints?
Pipes? What are you talking about?
Would you like a little clam-dip, honey?
We're in love with your roommate.
Healy you dog!
Here's the info you asked for.
Take it easy, that's Bill.
Tell Bill to get the fuck off!
Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know I'll have your car back in a couple hours, I'm still staking out this girl's apartment.
Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about.
But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did.
Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar? All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins.
Isn't that a little politically incorrect?
-- He's in a cage?!
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
That...? Vestibule.
Harold and Maude is my all-time favorite movie.
All set.
Are you okay?
She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then.
Ted, I'm the kind of guy who shoots from the hip. Now I want you to level with me: Did you knock this skirt up?
Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
I think your life's about to change.
Thanks, Healy. Good work.
Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
Well I think you're right, I should look her up.
Do what?
Oh Christ... poor dog.
Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a letter outlining our deal?
Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine until you showed up.
What?
No prob, I could use the company. I've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight.
That must make it tough.
'That right? Good for you.
I don't know, it was complicated. He's in San Francisco, I'm in Miami.  Besides, Magda's psychic dog hated him.
Good lookin'?
So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.
An old flame?
He's a nice guy, isn't he?
What...?
Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt yourself?
So who you taking to the prom?
Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets.  God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
Hey.
I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat.
Well... why don't you move back?
Uh, Mare, what kind of dog is Puffy?
Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
Woogie and I went out for awhile in high school.
What what are you doing here?
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
You're looking at him. C'mere and take a look at this beauty.
Charlie, that's mean. Come on in, Ted. Don't listen to Mr. Wise Guy here. He's a joke a minute.
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
No, no, please!
So what's up?
Carrying out our mission, Mr. Secretary. If you don't mind, we're very busy right now. We need to be able to do our jobs.
This was not the President's intention when he gave that order. What if the Soviets don't see the distention? What if they make the same mistake I just did?  There will be no firing anything near ANY Soviet ships without my express permission, is that understood, Admiral?
This private assurance represents the word of the Highest Authority?
Good.
Jesus Christ, guys. What the hell's Khruschev thinking?
There's still no sign they know that we know about the missiles. Been a lot of cloud cover; probably think we aren't getting any good product.
Who gives a shit about the midterms now? The Soviets are putting nuclear weapons ninety miles away from us.
The other thing is...
...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
Oh, still sore about this.
We're getting everyone together as fast as we can.
Hey, Mac. You're up bright and early.
-- You listen to me. Nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way. You're fucking here right now because of the Kennedys. They may be wrong. They make mistakes. But they're not weak. The weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds.
I want an hour with him.
I said his heart, not his attention.
Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.
Forget it, Scotty.
Hey, sport. You winning?
So what've we got today?
No choice. This is going to cost lives any way we go. Do nothing, and it could be 80 million of ours. We have to get rid of those missiles.
We have to try the blockades. It probably won't work. It may just be delaying the inevitable. But we can't just go to war without trying not to.
What about these low-level flights? They're starting in what? An hour? Do you realize what you're letting yourself in for?
I'm your political advisor, and I'm giving you political analysis here. This is a setup. The Chiefs want to go in. It's the only way they can redeem themselves for the Bay of Pigs. They have to go in, and they have to do it right. It's that simple.
We can horsetrade with Khruschev on ships. But it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles.
He's right, we can't rescind DEFCON 2. The Soviets will think we've gotten sweet on them.
It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.
Bob?
Bob, is there any way we can avoid stopping a submarine first?
Captain, belay that order!  Bob, where's that coming from!
They're going to kill me next. That's what I hear. These new Indians are destroying everything. Our people are a quiet people.
We got the wire ya was comin'. You're the Indian official, yeah?
Respect the dead, Hoss. Because when --
This is a restricted area.
Keeping of the souls. Do they still burn their dead or something?
Water. Worth killing for out here, I'd think.
White eagle feather through the circle. That's their symbol.
Let's see it.
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
You weren't sent here to go off on your own detail, Ray. You were sent here to assist in a Selective Operations Unit. These regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to The Graveyard, to Indian Country. I need you behind me, Ray. Not pulling against me.
All I could think of was... not here. I don't wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from home.
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
You ever put your hands on me again and you'll be doing the books for a baitshop in the fucking Everglades, Mister.
Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.
Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.
He also said "listen to the water."
Not Native American myths and legends. I'm with the FBI, Walter, remember? Not National Geographic.
Cuz I'm a skin?
Five-hundred year old turtleshell rattle...
You had a vision. You had yourself a vision. A man waits a long time for a vision. Might go his whole lifetime and never get one. And along comes some instant Indian with a Mastercard and brand-new shoes, has himself a vision.
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
Bullshit. You had a vision. You got sign from the old ones.
Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes?
Your relatives must've taught you something.
What?
Ray. X22.
Good.
Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard.
Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.
That's a big comfort to me.
Not in this case. CHARLIE  You saw a MiG push negative 4G?
Where were you?
The what?
Too aggressive?
Yes. I'll give you that!
It dies. We live.
Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty work.
You know what really scares me? Living too long. Losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. And my brains...Sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime TV.
Come on.
And now?
Food...and you...my F-14!
I'm still second best.
Where'd you get it.
You look way out there. Out past the date line. West becomes East, all things change. You cross the line...today becomes yesterday...or tomorrow, I forget which.
I sit. I think. I play games.
Now?
You weren't gonna say goodbye?
Hey, I never said I was a fighter pilot...I never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. I can find contentment in a good book. I don't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I just get happy being with the right man.
Well?
Lieutenant... Is there... a Russian attack?
Can't shake him.
Hey, if it was easy, everybody would want to come up here and do it..... Instead of just us.
Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up.
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
Not anymore.
I know!
Is it the plane?
Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
What do you want?
Let me do the talking.
It's not Cougar's place. It's ours.
Slider -- they let you into Top Gun? If you're among the best in the Navy, I tremble for the security of this country.
Who's your pilot?
You think you can stay up with us.
Great move. Great
YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
OKAY, GOING UP. ICE, GO HIGH.
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
Need a hint?
He's seat of the pants... Completely unpredictable -- nothing by the book. All over the sky. But I don't know, Skip, he's really got something.
You didn't help.
You just did an incredibly brave thing! What you should have done was land your plane. You don't own that plane, the taxpayers do. I should ream you out for it. But it just doesn't work with you. You're a hell of a flyer. You are maybe ...too good. You never really stepped in it yet. So this is your chance. I'm gonna send you up against the best. They are better than you. Maybe they'll knock that shine off your eagle and you'll see, finally, where discipline and teamwork fit it. Maverick hasn't really heard anything but TOPGUN. He snaps out of it.
Sir?
We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.
Sometimes it's luck, but in this case, he earned it... I served with your old man.
I'm nothing like him.
Not something they tell dependents.
What's wrong with this one?
The Last Resort.
Shut up and drive!
Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker.
Thank you.
Hmm.  It seems you left something in our safe.
Sorry.  Too perfect.
Well, Cohaagen, I have to hand it to you...This is the best mindfuck yet.
Come on, Cohaagen!  You got what you want.  Give these people air!
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person?
Who told you to think?!  I don't give you enough information to think!  You do what you're told!!  That's what you do!
Kill him.
What the fuck is going on here?!  You can't install a simple goddamn double implant?!
Oh shit....Oh shit...
Two-headed monsters?
Hetero.
What do you want?
I'm listening.
Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.
She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
You open it.
Any news of Quaid?
You're Kuato, right?
Yeah, you did.  I told you not to but you did anyway.
That son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.
Let me go!
Doug, maybe we should take a trip.
Lori, move.
It was implanted by the Agency.
The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.
Now help me out here, Doug.  You were interested in a memory of...
Right.  Mars.
You.  You're the same.  No matter where you go, there you are. Always the same old you.  Let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself.  I know it sounds wild, but it's the latest thing in travel. We call it an "Ego Trip".
Go on.
I didn't lose it.  Cohaagen stole it. He found out that Hauser switched sides,-so he turned him into somebody else.  Me.
Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
Aliens built it.
Wait!
What?
Knock it off, Burt!
A beauty, isn't it?  We bought three of them for the rec room.
Negative copy on that, Pham, check your frequency.  I'm on forty-nine.
That's fine.  We've got some new things to teach them.
Well, we'll ask around.  Let you know if we hear of anything.
Jesus Christ...think it smells like that 'cause it's dead?
We're not going over there, right?
Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.
Uh oh, it's Nancy.  She wants another load of firewood.
She's got us.  Now, listen, the plan is: we have done our last job in Perfection.
Relax.  A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
This is one big mother!
We'll take your word for it.
Its tires are flat...
Come on, everybody!  We gotta run for those rocks over there!
Civil?  I'm civil.
We're here, Val.  Just tell us what you need.  Come back.
That's the sky that's going to be over our roof every night, when we're done.
Come on.  Get away from it!
Hi, I'm Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck. I'm up here for the semester...
Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs.  You know, they measure vibrations...
Darn it!
He was your snitch.
Isn't there a ten to fifteen-percent margin of error?
Where's the nearest hospital?
I noticed.
"Art's Supplies" is founded on trust, Mister --
Let's snuff this lowlife!
I can describe it.
How can you remember that?
Exactly what information led you to arrest my client just two-and-a-half hours after the shooting took place?
Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.  It's an awesome responsibility.
So go take your job on Wall Street.
Chinatown street gang.
Kim denied it. But he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. Seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with Duane Lindeman.
-- Easy as that, huh?
Easy? No... We have to find some piece of evidence that got buried, to reopen the sucker.
When did you start working for the goddam D.A.?
-- Yeah?
A fucking wheelchair?
1530 Rivington Street.
But what?
How long did it take Badalato to drive Jimmy Chin's body from Chinatown to the morgue?
Pardon... Which dialect do you speak?
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
I embroidered.
So there goes your theory about the Joes giving up Shu to protect their trigger man.
I haven't thanked you for your work, Kitty. You're doing good work.
I need sleep. Some of us are mere mortals.
Exactly what happened then?
I didn't need to know that a man I'm defending on a gang-murder rap is a prison soldier who kills over drugs?
'lo, Cecil.
...You told the Desk Sergeant you were certain Mr. Kim wasn't the killer?  You left your telephone number?
No, s-sir.
Of course you know Dean Rabin, one of my Assistant D.A.s. Dean generally handles nuisance cases like the... what's the man's name?
Shu Kai Kim.
Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification.
Isn't it unusual for a man who's just committed a murder in plain sight to bring the weapon back to his apartment?
Didn't this investigation, with its attendant publicity, catapult you into the office you now hold?
Did you do any hands-on work or did you just supervise, from on high?
Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
Isn't it true that without Esparza, you had no investigation?
No.
What were you... Why were you at Shu's trial this afternoon?
-- Roger --
Five years.
Mr. Ortega... What is "La Compania"?
A Cubano army, basically... inside and outside prisons.
For control of the prison drug trade?
Yeah, we do some of that.
"Materiel"? What do you mean by that?
By "takes care of," you mean "kills".
And why was an exception made?
Mr. Stipe. A young man named Jimmy Chin was shot to death eight years ago, in Chinatown. Do you remember talking to the police?
The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. The world is a hologram, Albert.
Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
Well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here. I don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods. In fact, when the state boys called me about a "J. Edgar" coming up I think I said, "So what?"
Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.
You're lucky I am not wasting you.
That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
GOD. I'm beginning to lose faith in the United States Government and that includes the telephone system. Don't you folks talk to one another. That's her trailer there and I haven't touched a god damn thing. Agent Chet Desmond come by a second time and asked too see Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer  ...which I showed him. I went back to my trailer...  After that I never saw him again.
I am going over here.
Mrs. Simmons owns the trailer and she lives in town. Teresa rented it about a month ago.
Was there an argument?
Is there a golf course around here?
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
Yes...
Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil?
Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the Blue Rose meant.
And neither will I.
Did she ever mention any friends?
You know, I never told anybody, but once for about three days, just before her time, Teresa's arm went completely dead.
We're not. You and I are going to get some food.
Noooo...
Do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster?
Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
What are you doing?
Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. Never.
I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night long.  They all knew you at that place.
How did the car get back here?
But I love you, Laura.
Nice night.
Did you make me a tape?
I already made you two tapes.
I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
We're on our way, Baby.
Laura, I'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
Not now.
This afternoon?
What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.
See what?
I understand.
The Norwegians are coming next week and I want you to learn to say what I just learned in Norwegian. So you can talk to them. I want you to learn to say, "Hello, my name is Leland Palmer".
A friend from school.
Oh, I thought I saw you.
Leland...
Who am I?
If Leo comes here, he won't believe that I am out doing the "Meals on Wheels".
Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.
I want to settle this thing and be done with it. I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
...here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy...
Gruber...
You know what that would mean?
It's a crime.
Yes.  It is a crime. A serious crime.
I... yes.
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
No.
I did.
Objection, we've...
...to get her heartbeat back...?
...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
No, actually, she was referred to me. She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
Yes.
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear. Isn't that what you did?
My God, we tried to save her... You can't know... You can't know...
...apartment.  No, no. Please. You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
No, you did fine.
I appreciate -- a man as busy as --
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much...
Uh... in the, well, in the interests of her family... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution. Her doctors...
Do you know who her doctors were?
We have to... we... we have to keep you under wraps. Please don't, don't discuss...
Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Mrs...
Why is that?
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.' 'Cause I know who you were. You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are. I know who you are.
Are you done?
Why?
And are they going to get it?
Maybe what?
We, we... No... we just had a small reversal in the case...  I have some, uh... I have some work to do...
Yes.
If I don't 'grow up...'
You, you don't under...
No.
Mr. Alito, please.
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
This is Miss Costello...?
Yes. Price...
Kathy Price.
I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no question of that. It's just a matter of how big...
I can subpoena you, you know. I can get you up there on the stand.
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
...You saw her?
...fifty thousand dollars?
He's not in, Sir.
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
...now who is that...?
They killed her. And they're trying to buy it...
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
Uh... the admitting nurse...
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.  The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.  She wanted to move to Boston.  How badly did she hurt us, Joe?
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
She told me.
What?
Yes.
Yes.
...of the procedures...
What happened in those three...
What happened in those three minutes...?
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Huh. And why is that?
Looks almost cold now, don't it?
We'd be the first to make contact with 'em -- see?
Madrid has just blacked out!! Nothing more coming through.
Mister Secretary - if they link up with those others near Fresno...
You seem to know a lot about him.
Forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines.  They had him on the cover of 'Time'.  You've got to rate to get that!
What's he like?
I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
Nothing there now.
What was it like?
They've blocked it!
I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...
It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
I got a message for you.  You're the guys from Pacific-Tech, ain't you?
Uncle Matthew...this is Dr. Clayton Forrester.  My uncle - Dr. Matthew Collins, pastor of the Community Church.
Let's go back inside, Uncle Matthew.
Number three to. D.O....Number three to D.O.
I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.
Maybe these are not men - not like us.
Can I read it?
Yes, but...
I don't follow.
Dylan, it's breakfast.  Not arts and crafts  What?
I should survive two days in Palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial, don't you think?
I'll be there in three hours.
No.
Ms. Langenkamp.  I'm afraid there are no evening visiting hours in Intensive Care.
Dylan?  He's holding well.  Earlier he had some problems, he's in an oxygen tent just now...
DO you mind...
Finish, please!
Who?
Mommy's fine, Dylan.  Just had a bad dream.  What're you doing out of bed?
I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
What...what is that?
I'm fine.
Heather?  You doing okay?
Holding my own.  You know that guy who was calling me all the time?  He's started again.  He's been putting stuff in my mail.
When do you think it'll be done?
Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.
Heather, what is it?
It can be captured, sometimes.
No, not really.  I...
Now?
What?
Do you remember the last time you and I danced under the stars?
What are they doing?
Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
Everyone aboard young Bill?
Come in.
Yes sir.
My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
Why don't you go and try some of that on?
When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay.  But you can't make this okay, can you?
Look, meet us out front when you're through.  If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.
Yeah.
You okay?
Ninety-six.
Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
You know, I never had friends like this.
You gonna jump?  Or are you just having a last look?
Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move?
Listen man, I think I have a problem.
They don't know that.  We were the only one's on deck. Look, there's nothing they can do to me right?  I'm a kid.
Do what?
That's how he died you know.
Shouldn't we turn away?
What's on your mind?
Chicken is a fool's game captain.
But you invited is aboard.
And I would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here.
It will be more than that, I can promise you.
It has nothing to do with him.
What's your problem?
Because I felt like it.  What do you care?
What do you think?
You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
Do you think this is funny?  Some kind of joke?  You lost six people out there.
... Absolutely not.
The papers are going to eat you alive.  Even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission.  They want someone to be accountable.
Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
What's that supposed to mean?!
Artie? That you, Artie?
This be it?
Hey... You gotta smell in this room of puke... You been pukin' in here, little girl? Huh?... You sick?... Pregnant?
Whisper it... Whisper "fuck me"... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper...
Thought you said this was a private club. How come I'm allowed in without bein' a member?
That's right... Could have a bad accident, though... before... durin'... or after a hold-up...
You say it's straight ahead a mile?
Everythin's relative. Where's that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didn't split up, I hope.
I thought you two were in Austin, Texas. Or Takes-us, as they say in these parts.
But how are you finding New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
My name's George Kovich. Bet you've heard of me.
What happened on the charges?
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
Johnnie, I can't tell you, honey. Is there anyway we can get on the road tonight? We've got to find them kids.
That bastard Pucinski...
You won't of missed much.
Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.
Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'.
Hey, my snakeskin jacket... Thanks, baby... Did I ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom?
But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.
Actin' funny how?
There's worse things that can happen to a man, honey.
One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? Puttin' a detective on us. I'll tell ya Lula... Well... It's more'n me killin' Bob Ray Lemon...
Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
You mean like pedal pushers?
Okay, manslaughterer who's broke his parole and got in mind nothin' but immoral purposes far's you're concerned.
What kinda trash talk is that?
What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.
Lula... I learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show I heard on the radio... How leeches is comin' back into style.
Sailor? You expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose?
My God,  it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?
Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...
I do.
The water was rollin' off me. And I was dirty, too, like I hadn't had no bath in a long time, so the sweat was black almost.
Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.
I know you're thinkin' that I got more'n some of my mama in me? Well, I couldn't help it. Sailor, I really couldn't. I'm sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin' hunk of awful-smellin' meat out of his pocket? I near barfed. And them poor diseased puppies!
Hard to tell what's shakin' in a place like this, honey. You don't want to be walkin' in the wrong door.
How much we got left, honey?
Yes I did... I sure did... The bad side of it is I did some drivin' for a man named Marcello Santos...
I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together.
What's that?
She died right in front of me. Why'd she have to go and do that, Sailor?
I'm gonna stay here in this room, Sailor. I don't feel so good? This heat makes me tired.
That you, Sail, honey?
A little, I think... Darlin'?
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped 'em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob'ly killed the most.
You hungry? Pace and I ain't had dinner yet.
If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am.
Just a place.
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
You're comin' home, precious. Santos' gonna drive us to the San Antonio airport.
Course I am, mama.
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
Wouldn't make any difference.
Simple? Kill him? How?
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
Yes.
Where? In the leg?
See! I knew you had it all under control.
You give me your permission to kill Johnnie Farragut.
I'm gonna take your silence as a "yes"...
What?
No.
Oh, don't worry 'bout that...
By who?
I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.
I didn't see nothin'...
Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
I thought you were tinkering.
It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.
He said something about being between things.
I think it's more complicated than that. Besides, he's a little... scattered. He almost... did something stupid tonight. At least, I think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now.
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
That was good.
Listen, Hannah, I'm flattered, really, but right now I --
Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would sneak in here and read your book without asking you?
Good God. Let's go rescue him.
So sensitive.
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.
Such as.
Uh huh. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car...
You'll be all right then. Look at Carlyle, when he lost his luggage.
Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those stories.
In a sense.
How are you -- is it Joe?
That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently?
I've been trying to finish a book...
Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some things we need to talk about...
Yes. But that's not why I called...
It was my mother's. She won it in a penny arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic school.
It's just... for good luck. Some people carry rabbits' feet...
Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James?
You cold, James?
Really?
Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.
That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
Blocked.
Colon cancer.
Where's that?
It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years.
Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking 'I can't let that kid get on the bus alone -- he might never get on the bus again.' You were thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract this kid.' So you did. It was -- in its way -- a noble act.
It's warm.
I eat.
When?
You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?
I'm not going with them.
That strikes me as odd.
I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist and -- and -- I suck.
I'm sure.
Emily left me this morning.
So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.
No, really, Sara, I don't think you --
You got me.
Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...
Are you limping? Why are you limping?
Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
I know that. I know what's at stake here...
James Leer.
I know.
Oh?
Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one.
What is it, Grady?
Say, Professor Tripp, is all that stuff true about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on his dick. To make himself, you know, like, last longer?
Yo, Traxler.
One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you?
Foreman now.
I was just thinking of... the noise.
Is it because of Anna?
I don't know. She won't talk about it.
She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.
Is that right?
Not too far.  Are you a bird-watcher too?
You can't talk to me like --
No.
Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?
You don't know?
You said last night. I went to bed pretty early.
I suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill.
Yes.
Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.
I'm adjusting okay.
Sergeant Lucas.  May I come in?
Can I ask how old you are?
How come?
No thank you.
Ms. Kramer.
What will happen if I do?
I know because... it's just something I know.
Can't I stay a little longer?
I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
How's the journal?
Forget it.
Maybe it's the way I look. Or the sound of my name.
How do you feel about that?
Then why are you talking about this?
How long is this going to take?
I'm afraid not.
Do you know what "normal" is?
I suppose it's however society defines it.
Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal!
I don't know.
Of course it is! That's why I'm telling you!
When I say the word "girl" what is the earliest image that you can remember?
Did you and your sister often take naps together?
Did you get an erection?
It was a small house.
How do you feel about that?
I'm all right.
Here's this nice, hard working guy who suddenly appears out of the blue and rides the bus to and from work. I mean, who rides the bus anymore?
What?
They could eat you.
So... what's your dark secret?
Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole.
Do you?
It's been a while since...
Hey, there.
What was prison like?
Nothing. It's over.
Most people say the odds are against me.
For men like me. They say most of us end up back... there. I'm saying there are risks... seeing me.
What?
I'm not scared.
I don't need a plant.
Nice shot, Lins.
I can't believe you let them do this!
I haven't worn mine in months.
I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
No.
Hippy, just relax.  You're making the women nervous.
Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker.
The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.
Try again.
How?
What's the plan?
Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.
Why bring it here?
Lins, stay away from that guy.  I mean it.
Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen... de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc syringe... and some... heating blankets. You got all that?
Is that it?  Is this right?
Yuh?
I think they're from 'you know'.  Some place that has similar conditions... cold, intense pressure.  No light.
Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. We're checked out.
Radiation is nominal.  The warheads must still be intact.
I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.  We need early warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.
You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
You're right... I don't.  I just need to know that this thing is out of here!  You hear me, Roger Ramjet?
Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna be fancy.  When he gets down there he'll just sit, like a dumb-shit.  Unless something wanders through view of the camera, you'll get nada.
No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little.
Stand by on the ROV.
Getting a reading?
You boss is having a full-on meltdown.  Guy's fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we're all ringside!
High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.  Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.
Would we see the flash?
So, it will just take you a little longer to get over it.
And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?
Did you sleep well?
But how could we...at a time like this when we just... well, let's at least first have a look around the other islands. Could be that something might turn up there.
That must be Basiluzzo.
More so than the shark?
Maybe you'd better ask him.
And why do you tell us this only now?
Are you feeling better?
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
Have you read it?... They're asking for anyone with information to get in touch with them.
Yes, you should go.
Sandro, I don't want you to come with me, I don't want to see you... How can I make it clear to you?...Why did you come?
But sooner or later we've got to end this relationship. And it's better to do it right now.
Sandro ... maybe it's best that you go in alone.
Claudia, let's get married?
Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?
Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...
Sandro, I'm not coming down.
Tell me once more.
Well, with a shark running loose around the place, I for one won't get aboard that raft! They'll have to catch it first. I want to see it right here before my feet, dead or alive.
They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken.
It's really a fact -- there's nothing new under the sun. Now, look here. Look at this structure... a kind of natural shelter. Sandro, that's how you should design your houses.
Claudia, I know how you feel, but there are already two of us staying...
Up until now those smugglers were operating only around the Palermo area. This will be a nice surprise for the Lieutenant in Milazzo... Call up headquarters. Bring them up to date and have them give you instructions on what to do with this crate.
Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my father, too.
Now look, my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard. What have you got to say about that?
Yes, she takes care of the garden.
Then it's impossible for her to know me. In the villa where I'm at, we have a male gardener.
So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
And how come you're up so early?
We've decided to go to Montaldo's place. In fact, Ettore should already be there.
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
Now, tell the truth, aren't you a bit disappointed?... But I already told you...
I read one of your articles regarding the disappearance of a girl. I'm that girl's fianc.
Is that possible?
About fifty miles or so. If you want, I'll give you the name of the storekeeper.
Who?
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
Because...
Look at the statues, they're thin.
Who tells you these things?
I... I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I... I won't be able to fit in, I... I won't be able to squeeze into Heaven.
God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said...
Sister Marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress Sister. Is that true?
Yes Mother.
I burnt them.
Why?
How many times have I burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of.
Have you ever loved anyone?
Oh, there are so many.
Oh, yes!
You've been alone together?
The baby they made up.
Yes I do,  but I want you to...
I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.
No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.
What do you mean?
Are you married?
No.
No questions.
Where do you think babies come from?
Do you know a Marie?
Why should I?
No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
Do you?
No, but I can never tell her that.
Why not?
... and that you don't believe you carried a child.
That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget.
Sometimes, yes.
She watches... she listens.
Yes.
That you're a mistake?
And then...
As much as Mother Miriam does?
And why am I here?
Why?
Yes.
No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How did the baby get into you?
I'm afraid.
I ate.
Do you know who put it there?
Is someone in the room with you?
Why?
So I could go to him.
Him.
Are you frightened?
He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
Who?
Yes.
Yes.
Look into the convent records.
Are you dictating my position to me? We're getting into some sticky legal territories here.
Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right?
Marie's dead Mama.
Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!
The one up on the third floor?
Yes.
No.
Who told you this?
You can call me Sister.
Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?
None as far as I know.
Was there a priest?
What's his name?
Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination.
I believe Agnes is different.
Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
And you weren't shocked?
Not simple, no.
Then help her.
Sister Paul?
Yes.
Listening to angels?
I don't think I care to know.
And my permission?
I haven't decided yet.
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
Stupid woman... and that's all?
Hand rolled.
Even Christ would partake socially.
Of course.
She is an innocent.
Who knew she was pregnant?
The baby?
The scandal...
You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.
No!
Of course, John.
Yes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddy's son of 'em. I saw their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. "Mister, can you spare us a copper?" he said. I was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler ... So, I took them under me managerial banner.
Bet you're only eight and a half.
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
Shurrup!
Well --
Why aren't you at work?
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
It is, y'know.
Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.
What's up?
Oh, there you are!
Come on, Auntie, you're winning.
Morning!  Who's that little old man?
Sorry.
Are you pulling my leg?
The big hammer?
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...  Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!
Well ... what's the matter with that?
Parading?
Yeah ... so what?
And another thing, where's that old mixer?
How d'you reckon that one out?
You needn't bother.
If you're going to have a barney I'll hold your coats.
Of course, he's concealed about me person.
Please, can I have one to surge with?
You wouldn't!
The office was on the phone, they think it'd be better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton.
You are.
I would have said so.
That's what you tell me.
Is it? Is it really?
Well, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him.
Your Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.
Have <U>you</U> lost him?
Paul's grandfather.
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.
... as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like.
How's that?
Course he can talk. He's a human being, like. Isn't he?
Oh, he's gone to my club, has he?
Shove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you?
Cattle ranch!
Do you remember the pyramid?
Where the hell are we?
Any rotation?
Yeah.  Two hours.
Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.
This is Chaz.
Where does that go?
Dead!
And then we run out of food and oxygen.
Martin, this is Jay.  The intakes are clogged with dust.  We overheated and burned out a whole cell.
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
So does anybody have any suggestions?
No, I don't want us separated.
I never saw anything like that in my life... except molecular acid.
It makes me sick to see him like that.
There.  Should be coming through about there.
Now we're in for it.
Oh my God.
I'm getting nowhere.  The whole area around the pyramid is dead to transmission.  I think we should go after them.
But they don't know about the translation!  They could be in danger right now.
We can't spare the personnel.  We've got minimum takeoff capability right now.  That's why Chaz left us on board.
Look at that.
I think that's how it's getting oxygen to him.
Receiving.
What's wrong?
It'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it.  The line could get tangled in something.
There, it caught!
No, it's coming.
It won't come -- it's stuck.
It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too.
It's stopped?
Well, I kind of hate to point it out, but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation... and as you know, we used up most of that time in harvesting.
I was thinking of a line from an old poem: "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink."  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship.
Well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them...
Yeah... I forgot.
All right, Martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator.
And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
And you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and --
But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc!
Me either.  I tell you, I used to be with a mining outfit on Callisto, and when something like that hits... believe me, you know about it.
Yeah, it's fine.
We've got no option.  We're gonna have to get it off.
What do you need?
And?
I can't reach her.  Too much signal break-up.
MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.
Deal.
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
De Vries?
Still got him?
Hold it, hold it...
Wait.  Lost it.
What happened?
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.
That sounds promising.  Can we operate the crane from here?
They've changed their heading again.
They knocked out the external feeds.
Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?
Yeah.  Somebody won.
Think I spoke too soon...
Where'd you leave them?
Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at.
How's it going?
Today's party's finished their sweep, the relief team's out there now. Everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the auto-shop.
Of course your performance was no surprise to me. After the other day I regarded it as no more than - a promised fulfilled.
We all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns. If we don't blow them - who will?
Yes. I do.
Yes. The Shubert.
She mentioned, of course, that Margo expects to play the part?
D-day.
I didn't mean just the Theater.
It's nothing of the kind! Lloyd loves me, I love him!
I know nothing about Lloyd and his loves - I leave those to Louisa May Alcott. But I do know you.
We decided the night before last, before we came up here...
Champion to champion.
Not with me, you're no champion. You're stepping way up in class.
What do you mean by that?
What have you got to do with it?
Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.
She was a liar, she was a liar!
You used my name and my column to blackmail Karen into getting you the part of "Cora" - and you lied to me about it!
I don't suppose there's a drink left...
You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point.
Let's go sit by the piano.
I'm giving her a very high-class party. It ain't like a rehearsal, she don't have to be late.
She was magnificent.
I distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list. What are you doing here?
Eve, this is an old friend of Mr. deWitt's mother - Miss Caswell, Miss Harrington...  Addison, I've been wanting you to meet Eve for the longest time-
It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...
You mustn't worry about your little charge. She is in safe hands.
Eve! My understudy...
Margo, as you know, i have lived in the Theater as a Trappist monk lives in his faith. I have no other world, no other life - and once in a great while I experience that moment of Revelation for which all true believers wait and pray. You were one. Jeanne Eagels another... Paula Wessely... Hayes - there are others, three or four. Eve Harrington will be among them...
In time she'll be what you are.
Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-
Huh?
I'll try.
I don't want to be childish, I'd settle for just a few years-
What a thoughtful, ever-lovin' thing to do-
That I am...
She did...?
She hasn't missed a week since I left - but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask - check with her.
What?
I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.
You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.
And you, I take it, are the Paderewski who plays his concerto on me, the piano?  Where is Princess Fire-and-Music?
Don't mix your metaphors.
Okay. Mix.
- shows up for an audition when everyone knew I'd be here... and gives a performance! Out of nowhere - gives a performance!
I didn't know Eve Harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon!
That word again! I don't even know what it means...
He does not exaggerate. I was good.
Often enough to keep the franchise.
Is it the money?
But Hollywood. You mustn't stay there.
Every day.
I think we'd like very much. Sure you won't mind?
When I told you what every young actress should know.
You hear all kinds of things.
Margo does not play a lunatic, Birdie.
She's on her way. With half the men in the joint.  It's only a fur coat...
Of course!
You bought the new girdles a size smaller. I can feel it.
When we get home you're going to get into one of those girdles and act for two and half hours.
Oh-oh.
Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
You probably won't believe me.
Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?
How long does it take?
I hope you don't mind my speaking to you...
Not at all.
You're Margo Channing's best friend. You and your husband are always with her - and Mr. Sampson... what's he like?
He'll agree with you. Tell me, what do you between the time Margo goes in and comes out? Just huddle in that doorway and wait?
Now who's show up at this hour? It's time people went home - hold that coat up...  ... whose is it?
Karen.
Don't worry too much about that. Margo just doesn't miss performances. If she can walk, crawl or roll - she plays.
They certainly don't waste much time.
There can't be very much-
- and you felt just like that talking to Addison.
Some vague promises of a test, that's all - if a particular part should come along, one of those things-
Something most important you can do.
Over my dead body...
During your second act scene with your father, Roger Ferraday's supposed to stay way upstage at the arch. He's been coming closer down every night...
Relax, kid. It's only me and my big mouth...
It's just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about-
You've what?
Dear Birdie. Won't you sit down, Miss Worthington?
That little place just two hours form New York. It's on my list of things-I'll-never-understand. Like collecting shrunken Indian heads...
We're never deeply angry, we just get sore. The way you do. We know you too well...
What about Bill?
Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
Margo.  Margo, I want you to know how sorry I am about this...
How was the concert?
Of course she knew! For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part-!  Karen, let me tell you about Eve. She's got everything - a born actress. Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant-
We're driving out to the country tomorrow night. Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I...
When you asked a minute ago it was five-forty-two. It is now five forty-three. When you ask a minute from no, it will be-
All this fuss and hysteria because an impulsive kid got carried away by excitement and the conniving of a professional manure slinger named deWitt! She apologized, didn't she?
Have you forgotten about Eve? What she is, what she's done?
There you are, both of you. Max, Karen has decided it's time to go.
Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
She's your understudy.
How fortunate that I have an understudy so ready, so willing and so able to go on.
Very discreet. A note right out in the open like that. Next time tell your lover to blow smoke rings - or tap a glass...
You know, she probably means well, after all...
That depends.
"Liebestraum."
Miss Caswell?  What?
I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?
This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.
You get quick action, don't you?
Well...
I promise.
This is for lawyers to talk about, this concerns a run-of-the-play contract, and this you can't rewrite or ad lib!
Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.
I didn't hear you.
--and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau--
--Bradlee went to Harvard--
--I'm smart enough to know my story was solid--
Goddamnit--
I never scared anyone before.
We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked.
When?
He's another Ivy Leaguer so he'll probably expect you to be understanding--might surprise him if you're not.
--shit--
--I know, I know--
--almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.
--I want you to shut up and listen to me--
--That cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the Democrats--five guys had control--
I think that's him.
Hmm?
--fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats--
I'll never get out of here in time.
Hi, it's me. I'm still here.
Well of course.
It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the OK from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the OK from the President.
I think.
You've really got to go.
Who were they?
--omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.
It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere.  ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it.
But they both worked at the White House?
Then it's our asses, isn't it?
I assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.
Probably you're right, but a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars.
Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--
To where?
Go on.
I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
I hope you noticed how coolly I behaved under the threat of discovery.
Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines.
--don't you miss the grand scheme too.
How grand?
Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.
Government. Recently retired.
Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?
...go on, go on...
Could develop.
I can predict the next words you're gonna say: "anyone but Bernstein."  I want to send a reporter to Miami.
--no--
Does "they" mean the White House?
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
Look, Chris.  There are just some things you need to learn, that's all.
Me too.  For the most part.
Forget it.
Nice car.
You're missing the game for us?!
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
He likes it.
Ah, you'll get her back soon enough. That's easy, she likes you.  What you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons.  You gotta give her what she's never had.
You got it, stud.
No you haven't.
Of course.
Did you guys hook up or something?
Oooh, yeah.  Oh, baby, you're so good.
Don't you love my sexy body?!
Nothing, I just hugged her back.
Unlisted age, plus "youthful mind," equals old.
My date's a flute-toting band dork. That answer your question?
Kevin, come on, the bus to Stifler's is gonna be here soon.
Yeah, sure.
You're not...busy?
Okay.
Yes dad.
Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?
Son.  This lady's here for you.
Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
Hold on.  You have no idea why I'm angry?
Stifler's mom got it in the divorce.
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
I still think you're okay.
What's up, fellas?
Strip?
Jim...
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
"Dear Ms. Hughes.  We're sorry, but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months, we've decided you are now rejected.  Enclosed is a 100-page, full-color brochure on how rejected you are."
Oh, Kev.
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
And I want to make things perfect for you.  You're right, Kev, we do have something good...and special.
I can't believe we just had our senior prom.
Well, no.  I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
Feeling better, Oz?
So does your tongue cramp up?
That junior chick?
Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm working on something new.
Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick!
You dipshit, you're expecting to score with some goody-goody choir-girl priss?
I don't know if I want to be doing this.
You know.  If we hook up, tomorrow I'll just be some girl you go telling all your friends about.
I'd use pills. They're painless.
The key is don't look down.
Actually, I'm waiting for someone.
Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.
Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
Thank God! What a relief! I thought... After you disappeared... I couldn't find you... I thought all sorts of horrible things...
Fan-fucking-tastic?
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
What about food? Even beautiful women have to eat. It's true. I read it. Please? A half an hour?  My treat?  Pleez! Don't make go out there alone again! I'm begging you!
Hello?
Because, Andy. It's a cure.
What the fuck!? You too!?
Here! Come on! Do it! Go ahead.
No wonder he let her go.
God. I can't believe it.
Oh God. Shit...
Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
Before the coma!
The ADM. Let's go.
So, if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves, what do you want with drugs? You like seeing lots of pretty colors when you're tearing people's throats out?
What's the problem?
I always wanted to do that. I saw it in a movie.
Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
Psychic awareness. Right.
You didn't know? But then why did you... well, don't worry. It's relatively mild.
Great. Later on we'll have to get together for cocktails. Right now I kinda have to hurry before I grow a lot of hair and eat people.  Say this heart thing works. What's it got to do with ADM?
All my life I've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind. Well this is it. This is power!
Andy? Andy is that you?
Yeah, I finally "checked out", thank God. But there's a bit of unfinished business.
Here.
Two more nights in this lunar cycle.
Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris?
I have to go now, before it gets light.
Poor Meetoo!
I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.
Why do you want to go to Paris?
Don't you, child?
Dmitri didn't want the money?
Boy, don't you hate it when that happens?
What do we do now?
But it's not	the money, Vlad.
Promise me she'll have her home.
Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know, every now-
Can I have your autograph?
Hey!
Who's on television?
Well, you take a meeting with him, I'll take a meeting with you if you'll take a meeting with Freddy.
It's an important issue.
Excuse... excuse me, when do I go on?
What do you mean, next?
So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
No, because they're-they're laughing, so  I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.
that I've got to... ah... ah... They're gonna laugh at him for a couple minutes, then I gotta go out there, I gotta ... get laughs, too. How much can they laugh?  They-they they're laughed out.
Yeah? Allison what?
Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
Look! Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night.  Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus!
Get him!
Hi. Hi, hi.
You-you play... very well.
No, no thanks. Hey, don't-
All right.
Yeah. I got, uh, I got a license but I have too much hostility.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You sure?
Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide was misinterpreted as romantic, by the college-girl mentality.
Neat, yeah.
Uh, I hate to tell yuh, this is nineteen seventy-five, you know that "neat" went out, I would say, at the turn of the century.  Who-who are-who are those photos on the wall?
Uh, narcolepsy.
Well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club?
'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
I know.
You're gonna sing? Do you sing? Well, no, it isn't  No kidding?  this is my first time. Oh, really? Where? I'd like to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, I'm interested!
No, they didn't. You have a wonderful voice.
Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.
Yeah?
...you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?
M'hm.
I don't-don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.
Look, look at that guy.
Oh, that's hilarious. They're back from Fire Island. They're... they're sort of giving it a chance-you know what I mean?
You see, like you and I...
Yeah.
All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.
Ye-ah. Was it... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.
No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.
Really?
Well, I need grass and so do you.
Are yuh?
Yeah.
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
It's his name.
And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
G-go on, I'm interested.
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
That's amazing. I-I-I... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got... nothing like that in-
You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
Sinatra?
and I keep, you know, it's-
My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired.  You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert?
snow shovel or anything or something.
Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta- whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter?
I mean was there another- I thought I heard a voice.
Alvy, what about... what if we go away this weekend, and we could-
Tsch, why don't we get... why don't we get Rob, and the three of us'll drive into Brooklyn, you know, and we show you the old neighborhood.
-me, my God, it's a great day!
Here's a real present.
Remember, we had that thing.
What's... you... well, what's the matter, You w-wanna go to that party?
She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-
You know... it's getting expensive my analyst... for her analyst. She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress. Her progress is defeating my progress.
...I'm thrilled. As you know, uh... uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.
Oh, oh, no, I can't-I can't eat this. I'm nauseous.  If you could-if you could just give me something to get me through the next two hours, you know I-I have to go out to Burbank... and give out an award on a TV show.
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor. Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
Yeah, this place is great.
Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
God.
Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
I'm late.
This is my room.
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
What'd I do?
Alvy, don't! You're using sex to express hostility.
You have a raccoon?
Yes.
Right. I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max, I was the best, I was all schoolyard.
Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
The one with the V.P.L.
No, no, I came out here to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis, so I... He's my-my food taster. Have you two met?
You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
Max, are we driving through plutonium?
Let 'im drop dead! Who needs his business?!
His wife has diabetes!
So the colored have enough trouble.
They're persecuted enough!
Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.
Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?
Oh. What about?
There were many men interested in you?
A triumph.  When did you get here?
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
Absolutely not.
Can we... one at a time?  Hold it down, and one at a time.  You're last, Cal.
It's going.  It's going.
The movie.
Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay?
Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's best friend.  I never said any of this, alright.  I'll deny it on the stand...  You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so great.  Maybe that's what this is all about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  You know adults don't do this for a living.  You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair. Clair's a mess.  Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  "Life is but a walking shadow.  A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film?
October-ish.
To dander.  Otis.
Why would she care?
He's gonna miss his flight.
It's not a contest.
I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months.
We've heard lots about you.
There's a test, you know.
Are you my big hard hero?
Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors?
I don't think so.
Give him a minute, Clair.
He gets huge advances on his novels. He's going back to that.  You know how he hates it here.
Did he promise?
Well, it might be Clair.  They're threatening not to come...
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
Otis!  No barking!
Okay, knock it off.
I think we should all take it tonight. Everyone's staying, stays.  No driving. That's the rule.  I love you Sally-Mae. You're going to have a fabulous time.
Otis!!!!
What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.
Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
About me!
Cal, too?
I guess.
They're the keys to your grandad's flat. Happy anniversary, baby.
Will you make love with me?
Yes, she is.
Yes I did.
But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
Well, you know...good days, bad days.
Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.
No you're not.
I'm a little in the puke zone.
What am I, five?
They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us...
Ryan, you've got to come!  You've got to help me find the dog!  I let their dog out.  We need to find the dog.
We have to find the dog, Ryan.
What?
Ryan!
Thank you.  I understand you're an interior decorator.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I...
That was my clue.
Who doesn't know about the infamous composer's conference of 1948 where Zhdanov persecuted the leaders of Soviet Music - Shostakovich, Prokofieve, and Myaskovsky.
I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know.
I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two?
She's all over him, are you blind?
It could be worse.
Like the last time.
Okay.
I'm worried about your Galiano.
Panes?
He's a novelist.
Hm.
We're always in here.  She really gets him, doesn't she?
He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.
Not nice.  Not kind.
I don't know what came over me, talking back like that.  I must be going crazy...
Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.
You know, you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be! Look at Z!  He started as a worker -- then he became a soldier!
Someone who follows his heart!
He's...he's dead.  You don't have to look for him anymore.  He was eaten by a praying mantis.
I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
Worker!  Come back here now!
Look.  How many other Princesses are there?
Why do they have you tied up here?
I mean, I've got the whole package, right?  A great life, a beautiful wife, and a few kids.
Of course not --
Bala has always been a hopeless romantic, General.
You new, kid?
So we're going back for more armor, right?  I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?!
Z!  Over here!
Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
Princess Bala, sir.  Your fiancee.
Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
Desperate times call for desperate measures.  Get me Ant Team Six.
So this Z...he fancies himself an individual?
So tell me.  Where's Z?
Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse --
I feel...isolated.  Different.  I've got abandonment issues.  My father flew away when I was just a larva. My mother didn't have much time for me...when you have five million siblings, it's difficult to get attention.  I feel physically inadequate -- I've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight.  Sometimes I think I'm just not cut out to be a worker.  But I don't have any other options.  I was assigned to trade school when I was just a <u>grub</u>.  The whole system just...makes me feel...<u>insignificant</u>.
Ask me why we're so successful.
...Ants...
Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
I'm not in the mood.  Even when they're off work, they follow orders.
Wear this.
Something the matter?
Mrs. Dreyfuss, can I borrow some coffee -- and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs?
One napkin, coming up.  I wish we had some champagne to wrap it around.
All right -- I'll tell him.  Hey, Baxter -- that was Personnel. Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
Sheldrake?
Good night.
I thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first -- and then --
Well, it was just an idea -- I hate to see a ticket go to waste --
Well, don't tell the fellows in the office about the appendix. They may get the wrong idea how you found out.  'Bye.
Thank you.  I thought you were avoiding me.
How many of those drinks did you have?
Three.
Why?
What is it?
It's not important, Fran -- the main thing is that I got here in time -- and you're going to be all right --  -- isn't she, Doc?
Miss Kubelik --  -- you shouldn't be out of bed.
What kind of talk is that?  So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now.
My head -- it feels like a big wad of chewing gum. What time is it?
You don't want me here --
Someone from the office.
Give what up?
Yeah -- I know what you mean.  Queen.
A cemetery?
Cut.
You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
Was he really upset when you told him?
What for?
What are you doing with that?
As a matter of fact, I'm a pretty good cook -- but I'm a lousy housekeeper.
Some people take, some people get took -- and they know they're getting took -- and there's nothing they can do about it.
Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
Shall I light the candles?
We're going to finish that gin game.
You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
I never thought he'd do it.
For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me -- I was using him. See?  Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.
Where are you going? BUD Who knows? Another neighborhood -- another town -- another job -- I'm on my own.
I love you, Miss Kubelik.
Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik? I absolutely adore you.
Oh -- Mrs. Lieberman.
Oh, Mr. Baxter -- I'm glad you're here -- I was just going to get the passkey.
What for?
Baxter?
Well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
Look, Baxter, I'm not stupid. I know everything that goes on in this building -- in every department -- on every floor -- every day of the year.
What kind of joint are you running?
Are you going to deny it?
Not yet. But I hear it's one swell show.
I am?
Oh -- terribly sorry. It's that cold --
Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?
I mean -- the young lady -- whoever she may be -- it was on the couch when I got home last night.
Yeah --
The only thing is I'm staying at the Athletic Club -- and it's strictly stag so if you don't mind --
What do you mean, sorry?
You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.
What's gotten into you, Baxter?
Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.
I know.  Mr. Eichelberger -- in the Mortgage Loan Department -- last night he had a little Halloween party here --
Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it.
Maybe you're using the wrong approach.
Say, why don't we have ourselves a party -- the four of us?
Oh.  'Bye, Doc.
I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
What are you going to do, Doc?
Say, Baxter -- we're having a little party and we ran out of ice -- so I was wondering --
You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go. Goodbye, Doc.
Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
Mickey? He wouldn't do nothing like that. He's a jockey. They caught him doping a horse.
Family?
Where do we go -- my place or yours?
No kidding.
Ask anybody around here. As a matter of fact, when it's time for me to go -- and I may go just like that --  -- I have promised my body to the Columbia Medical Center.
A.W.O.L.?
What for?
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
Still afraid somebody may see us together?
Let's not start on that again, Jeff -- please. I'm just beginning to get over it.
I don't believe you.
I wasn't trying.
What do you think?
Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.
I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --
Come on, Fran -- don't be like that. You just going to sit there and keep bawling?  You won't talk to me, you won't tell me what's wrong --  Look, I know you think I'm stalling you. But when you've been married to a woman for twelve years, you don't just sit down at the breakfast table and say "Pass the sugar -- and I want a divorce." It's not that easy.  Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids are home from school -- my in- laws are visiting for the holidays -- I can't bring it up now.  This isn't like you, Fran -- you were always such a good sport -- such fun to be with --
Now, Fran --
I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.
What are you talking about?
Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?
Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat.
Tracks ?
No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir -- I'm a sauciere --
I don't get it -- You said your mission was to kill him. Let's do it, an' get our asses outta here. This  Kurtz is ruining the war; I mean, this don't look good for America !
What'd he say?
You'll see soon enough -- get going, sailor --
Who knows what's up there?
This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
Whoever put'em there didn't do it to kill people -- They put 'em up as signs --
Ours.
Touchy.
What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow.
Charlie?
No, sir.
We don't want to bother you any, we --
It's an honor to meet you Lance. I've admired your nose-riding for years -- I like your cutback, too. I think you have the best cutback there is.
Good swell.
What, sir?
What?
The wind --
Hell's Angels Four to Big Duke Six -- we'll need green smoke -- suggest you have the FAC mark it.
No. Walked.
Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
How's the pain?
How did we get here?
Going back  - to the jungle to die.
Yes...
You knew him best.
I'll never get over it -- But I'll always remember him...
Were you with him, when...
He'll kill us.
This one , Lance?
No shit... I think I shot the hell out of him.
Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz.  You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy.
Sounds like he's gone crazy.
I should be checking on the boat.
Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there?
Kurtz.  I know you've heard of him.
They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said.
Where's your chief supply officer?
Remember that demon in the gut? Sometimes it's nothing more than wondering if the so-called civilized life has bred the balls and brains out of you.  That's what you want out of this, isn't it?
Watch it with Meyerling.  Man's as mean and corrupt as they get. Cut his mother's throat if it'd get him a couple votes.
39   CONTINUED:
Sam?  We haven't seen him.
Maybe you should drive him into Devil's Cauldron, let them decide what to do with him.
Please, Anne Marie, you being here only complicates things.
When you ran off, I thought you'd keep going 'til you were back home in Washington.
Let's keep going.  We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.
New to the country, kid?
Sounds like professional jealousy.
Stay put!
I took the odds on getting down in one piece, and I made it.  Now we're in my territory.
Why in hell you care enough about me to die taking me in?
Still quite a hike to Devil's Cauldron.  Days.  A long stretch to go without sleep, my friend.  You can hide behind that pistol for now, but take your eyes off me long enough to sneeze --
Yeah?
How many do you see?
What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
You got one?
I'm hungry.  Go kill me some dinner.
Don't judge me.  You're a joke, coming here from a fucked-up culture, telling us what to do!
Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here.
Like I said, I'd still be up on that mountain, frozen solid, it wasn't for you.
I got it from here.  Thanks.
I need to rent a cabin.
What's the problem with Sam Wilder's place?
Pretty clever:  If the trappers got that signal beacon and get here in time, Sam's is the first place they'll look.  They may figure you're waiting for an airplane, so you can't stay in the shack by the airstrip.  Last place they'd expect you is on the far side of town.  I can't afford any trouble --
-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --
Bet you're right.  But I didn't come by to wangle a meal --
I'm too old for this shit.
Wilder's missing church services; you believe it?
You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.
LeMalle.  We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?
Go easy.
This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
You're not still writing that thank-you note?
I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.  Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any.  Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?
Spencer's doing fine. So what are you saying, that you're frustr...
Call me as soon as you're settled.
Only in the emergency room or when he was well.
I see the help -- judgement call.
An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.
Note. Put it in the note.
Why did yo do this for me?
You waiting for me to say something?  What sort of thing do you want? Look, I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.
I'm not kidding.
Two days.
Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go.
Hello?
I'm sure, Simon, they did something real off for you to feel this way... But when it comes to your partners -- or your kid -- things will always be off for you unless you set it straight. Maybe this thing happened to you just to give you that chance.
Hey -- you let him...
My son was outside playing soccer. I never saw him playing ball. Come on, you guys -- take me out for a good time... Take me out dancing.
Fries.
Well, ah... that's a personal question.
It's one idea...
Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home.
This one has a special meaning.
I'll take you... why not?
I wasn't asleep!!
I'm feeling... I've been feeling better.
Well...
No!!!
I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
I've got to sketch you.
What the heck are those for?
So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?
I'm sorry that I'm not taking you.
Good evening.
How you doing, great one?
Sorry. What are those cards?
Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
If you'll excuse me I'm not feeling so well.
It smells like shit in here?
Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.
Would you leave now, please?
I brought you Chinese soup.
I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
Do you ever get an erection for a woman?
You consider your life easy.
I get why you're angry. It's no snap to explain why I was like that, but let's not try to do it on the run...
Hey... I'm charged here. But she might kill me for showing up this late.
What's wrong?
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
Is there a problem?
But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably.
What?  You think I'm running you up?
What's your name?  We both know it's not Nicholai.
Oh, yeah.
I'll tell you this.  After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive.  But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one.
Good afternoon.  We have reservations at the Hotel Paraiso in Costa Blanca.
No, no.  I said the Hotel Paraiso.
The contract?
You think this is a fucking joke?
Yeah.
Ten million --
You're the computer hacker, you tell me.
Until a minute ago.
Someone hired both of you?
Because he is trying to retire me.
Yes.
Why?
Oh Jesus Jesus...
Just Electra?
It's not the same, is it?
Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.
Why not?
No.  I graduated from George Washington University.  Then I entered the Agency training program.
The exotic women.
The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.
Yes.  It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.
Is that what you wanted to hear? Something cold blooded... something remorseless...
It.  Tell it.  For all I know it could be a machine.
No.
No.
What do you think he's doing?
Okay.
Then, we wait.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
Except --
Ten years ago, I sat there in that same hotel window, sweat pouring off of me waiting --
For Nicholai?
It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear.  Things happened beyond my control.  I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.
Do you have ulcers?
Thank you.
Why?
Are you attracted to me?
Why?
What happened to her?
When did it start?
Four minutes.
Everyone regrets something.
Average.
I have been thinking about this for a long while.  I knew this day was coming.  I knew someday someone would make the call on me. I never thought about anyone that I had whacked.  What do you call it anyway?
Why didn't you fade?
I used to think about it.  I had Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe.  I could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but I couldn't see that next part.  'Then what?' So I'd stop thinking about it and go back to work.  You understand?
That's correct.
How to make a buck!
Sorry Katka, but I'm with Doug on this.
Who's your friend?
Oh yeah, what's that?
Right and not just the bar, Lubosh and his mates took the whole freakin' building.
Okay, it's in here somewhere. Let's keep it quiet.
Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!
Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
I feel like a mole in this joint, so I guess I might as well come out lookin' like one!
And put it on expenses?
I'll drill the locks and replace the barrels, that way it won't cost so much.
Wow!....What have you been doing, rolling around in it?
No....The Asylum!
Don't we have enough already?
I'll rig up something don't worry - Do you think I could bash through with that little hammer?
See if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls, give it a bit of atmosphere.
Just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better.
Perfect!
We're going to need it all.
Do you think anyone will really come here?
Why don't we go together?
Thanks. Come on Chris, give me a hand.
A fine specimen for conversion.
Chris, can you do me a favour?
You capitalist pig!
You know, there is one thing I can't figure out. All along they've been bugging me about those files and when I told them I'd burned all that stuff, they went nuts - they told the Consul guy they were medical records?
So?
Get me one of the disks. Ask a Czech girl to smuggle it in to me this evening. Put the others in a locker and write the details in a note to Reuters and be ready to send it, if this doesn't work. You'd better keep clear of your apartment too. Do you know someone with a phone?
It's that one isn't it.
Sure. Excellent.
Really?
A word of advice my celibate friend. These Czech girls look like dynamite and go like it, but don't be fooled; there's a price to be paid and it's going up fast. Right Kat?
Don't give me this Kat, I'm doing it for you and your country.
Let's walk over the bridge, we haven't done that for a while.
She's tired.
I think I'm stupid.....All you do is use me and expect me to wait for you.
I don't understand, it's your home?
Later. Jahn, I've been let down by the guys who were going to do the flooring. They brought the materials but took my money and ran. You guys have a school theatre don't you?
So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
There's three thousand crowns, it's all I got.
Great. And your all set for the performance?
A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
Did you take your things over to my place?
Uh-huh!
That's right.
A kind of freedom.
Enjoying our hospitality?
I'm not sure it's possible.
Yeah!
A drill, what are you up to?
Nothing. I've got to put up some kitchen shelves that's all. You've got one haven't you?
But I have to finish this....
I think we should be going honey.
In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
It was crazy not to have destroyed them
And there has been enquiries from the American Embassy maybe they are involved?
So go dance.
She asleep?
Pictures from the play. Jamie looks pretty --
'Bout what?
I don't want his money.
Were you with Jamie?
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
Hypotheticals --
Landon Carter. I was driving the car that --
Your book and your brown sweater and your hair. What's more to know -- ?
Can't you have a normal conversation?
This play -- ?
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
The world of the dead?
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
Yeah.  I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.
What do you actually know with religion?
You make me feel...
Come on.
What's the best thing I can see tonight?
From citizen high to citizen low.
Jamie --
I'm supposed to always be alone?
Up to?
No you didn't.  But he did change. Just not enough.
I am mad at you! And at Landon! And the universe! And God!  I don't even know where to put all my anger.
No.
How about your family?
Your parents are divorced?
Landon. You go on home.
I'd work backstage or something?
When do I get time for me?
Where did you get -- ?
Yeah.
Listen you little Asshole, I oughta --
Uh, yes, sir...
And you never heard of rock 'n roll?
What's N.R.C.?
I've been calling you for five minutes! Didn't you hear me?
How old are you?
Here's your jacket!
It's polyester.
He comes out of the cafeteria line, he's nervous, he spills his corn, and he asks you to the dance!
Hi, Marty!
Uh, hi, Eileen.
No, Chinese food is fine.
It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
You're not picking a fight, you're coming to her rescue. Maybe we'd better go over the plan again. Where are you gonna be at 8:55?
Your line, George!
Oh -- right! Uh, Madison 3489.
Did you ever consider that some doors are locked for a reason?
Exactly two minutes difference...  and it's still ticking!
Well, there's a mall here now -- I mean, there will be.
Professor. Well, not exactly, Professor. You see, we don't point it at the sun.
Your 'mother' wanted me to tell you that she was very impressed by what you did this afternoon, and that if you were interested in going to the dance Saturday, she's available.
Marty,  I know I've repeatedly asked you not to tell me anything about the future, but....well, those loud bangs on the tape recorder....are they....
...He just lets himself get pushed around all the time! People walk all over him and he never fights back, never stands up for himself.
Can you imagine your parents in bed together?
Me neither. I've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married. You think yours did?
He said not to tell.
What's going on?
What you been doing?
Where'd you get them antlers?
Kit... Maybe I'd better get a shovel.
I used to throw trash for the City.
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
Mmmmm.
Sure is pretty.
Well, it's not good enough.  Just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you, Kit? Guy like you.
Hi, I'm Kit. I'm not keeping you from anything important, am I?
Yeah, well, I'm going to work as a cowboy now... Or thinking about it. It's a routine, like anything. What do you think?
Can I come around and see you tomorrow?
Gosh, what was everybody talking about?
You know what I think?
What?
I found a lid. It was laying on the ground over there.
Is he upset?
What'd you put him in there for?
Boy. I had a feeling today was going to be the day... Helicopter.
Yeah.
Yes?
Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?
Hi, whatcha doing?
Yes.
Wanta sue me?
All these people applied for drivers' licenses in the same town in New Jersey on the exact same date.
It's your hand, Buckaroo.
Antidote to what?  Whose disguises?
And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
We will, old fried, we will.
Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?
...but he wasn't the real Doctor Lizardo...just this arachtoid creep that stole the good doc's body the year before in the Eighth Dimension when Prof. Hikita's lab exploded...
You.  Like the papers all say.
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
You keep an eye on it.
She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you...
Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
Pictures don't lie.
We're waiting for the Jet Car.  Billy's bringing it.
Is, uh... Is he okay?
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
Hello, Barton.
Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, how long have you been his... secretary?
...Who is this?
What DID you mean?
...A little social lubricant, Mistuh Fink?
I don't know exactly. But I do know what you're doing with that drink. You're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and Audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about.
I'll jus' walk on down to the Pacific, and from there I'll... improvise.
I'm sorry, I just feel like I know I shouldn't ask, I just need some kind of help, I just, I have a deadline tomorrow-
Goddamn voices... DROWN 'EM!
Souse! Souse! He manages to write his name on the back of his paycheck every week!
I didn't say anything-
...What is it Barton? Are you okay?
...Barton, is everything okay?
Neighbor, I'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink.
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
Well, I don't mean to get up on my high horse, but why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there?  Who cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop and Lady Higginbottom and  and  and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?
I can feel my butt getting sore already.
Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, I'll let you know if I'm bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view.
Ah, doctors. What's he gonna tell me?  Can't trade my head in for a new one.
...This must be boring you.
Jesus, what a day I've had. Ever had one of those days?
You're leaving?
...I guess it seems pathetic to a guy like you.
Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean to a guy from New York.
Jesus... You're leaving.
...Don't look at me like that, neighbor.  It's just me  Charlie.
Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.
That's okay, that's okay, that's okay  that's just fine. You probably just walked in here thinking that was going to be a handicap, thinking we wanted people who knew something about the medium, maybe even thinking there was all kind of technical mumbo- jumbo to learn. You were dead wrong. We're only interested in one thing: Can you tell a story, Bart?  Can you make us laugh, can you make us cry, can you make us wanna break out in joyous song? Is that more than one thing? Okay.  The point is, I run this dump and I don't know the technical mumbo-jumbo. Why do I run it? I've got horse-sense, goddamnit. Showmanship. And also, and I hope Lou told you this, I bigger and meaner than any other kike in this town. Did you tell him that, Lou? And I don't mean my dick's bigger than yours, it's not a sexual thing  although, you're the writer, you would know more about that. Coffee?
Congratulations.
Welcome to the Hotel Earle. May I help you, sir?
...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me.
What did... What did he 
Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!
You want my partner to kiss your ass?
Also known as Madman Mundt.
...I thought you said you were a writer.
When did you start drinking again?
There's no smoking in this building.
Take care, you hear?
It's been three months.
What was she like?
What are you talking about, Nick -- what's wrong with you?
Beth.  I didn't mean what I said. About --
What is your problem?  I'm trying to help you.  Why won't you let me help you?
She's really sick you know.  Don't you know what she's doing?  She knows I went to Berkeley.  She knows I knew Noah.  She makes up that story about me.  She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her.
Do you have a cigarette?
Yes, you do.
What's your new book about?
Because you didn't love him --
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
Didn't you study it in school?
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
Yes.
You're not going to stop following me around now just because you're on leave -- are you?
No.
Good.  I'd miss you.  You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.
How about Roxy?  Is she a fuck to the century, too?
How's your shoulder?
Do you think I told her to kill You?
No.
Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
I paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file.
You paid $50,000 for your character?
I found Lisa Henderson.
What are you researching?
Why?
It teaches you to lie.
What kind of drugs?
He was walking home from work. They only lived a coupla blocks from the clinic.  Somebody drove by and shot him.
Nope. She did.  Like I say.  It never panned.
Thanks.
Before your time, pop.  Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits. He's got a club down in the Fillmore now.
She knows where I live and breathe. She's coming after me.
You think I --
You all right, pop?  You want me to drive you?
Don't you get it, Gus?  If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley.  It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.
Not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch.
Do you want me to work the case, Phil, or do you want me to --
So what do we do -- nothing?
She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
Gus -- go over to Berkeley. Harrigan -- find out what else she's published.  Andrews -- get the files on her parents' accident. Carbon Beth on everything.  I want some psychological input on this Andrews and Harrigan go; Nick is left there with Gus.
Tell me again.  I want to hear you say it again.
You're driving around North Beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way --
She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.
Anderson.  Jack W. Donald M.  I'm sorry.  No Lisa.
I don't know.
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
Naa..
Ignorant art?
Ten bucks apiece.
Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
How much for these five?
I'm interested in showing Jean's work.
I hear your show was sold out already. There's a very important collector who's interested in some of your works.
Decipher?
Leeches. A long list of leeches.  It looks good like that.
A primate?
Oh, that's a "Leonardo's Greatest Hits" painting. You like it?
I see..  And... How do you respond to being called  hmmm...   yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."
Paint it out.
 In this corner?
"She loves me. Oh yeah she loves me! She loooooooves me, Oh yeah she loves me!" Bring me some chicken, baby!
Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing?
I am... On Gina.  Fuck  I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
So then what?
What're you doing? You're doing something.
... What's the matter?
I hadn't thought about it.
He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?
Don't you think he's using you?
You don't have to be sorry. There's no one to blame. Jean, you're a real artist. I thought I was one. You made me realize I wasn't.
Wanna Mac?
You're a fast mover.
No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get.
I can put you in the ring with him. Even book the dates.  But those big boys know how to fight. They could make you look real sissy.  I was looking at that painting upstairs. It's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything.  So what's your real name? 'Samo?'
What time is it?
I just don't think you're being fair.
YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.
Uh-oh!
Man, I was up on him years ago on the IRT.
It's cold.
I suppose you feel better now, sir.
Selina ... more facets than Vicki, huh?  Funny, but sort of mysterious...
"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
Well ... Come what may... Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne.
As I was saying:  I'm a woman, and can't be taken for granted.  Are you listening, you Batman you?
Hey stud:  I thought we had something together.
First you're gonna shut up.  Then you're gonna turn yourself in.
Don't be naive.  The law doesn't apply to people like him!  Or us --
You're not the Mayor.
Ah, the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
We've met.
You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck.
The news these days ... weird. People looking to superheroes for their peace of mind, and blaming their problems on super-villains ... instead of themselves, or their spouses at least.
And it's not even accurate ... I mean, "Batman Blows It"?  The guy probably prevented <u>millions</u> in property damage.
I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
What went wrong?  Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her.
And the truth frightened her?
Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.
Y'mean take off our costumes?
Let's make a deal.  <u>Other</u> than my blood, what can I off--
Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.
Me, domesticated?  By you?  I doubt it!  You repulsive... awful... <u>penguin</u>.
But who could've ... no, don't say it.
You know what, Mr. ... Penguin-Sir? I think perhaps I could help orchestrate a little welcome-home scenario for you.  And once we're both back home, perhaps we can help each other out ...
Bu ... wh ... I ... I mean ...
I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
And a very, very good one.
Okay, go ahead.  Intimidate me, bully me if it makes you feel big.  I mean, it's not like you can just kill me.
I have been trying to reach Wilfred with no success.  As one grows older, one yearns for family.
Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred?
Sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.
Please be looking for me.
Keep it.
Alfred and Bruce are like family.
Alpha.  Got it.  What the hell is attack plan Alpha?
Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
I'm totally over her.  Positively.
How did you...?
She's still alive.  He's adapted his freezing technology to reverse McGregor's Syndrome.  He's even found a cure for the early stages of the disease.
That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
Forget the stars.  Look here, at the Earth, our mother, our womb.  She deserves our loyalty and protection. And yet you spoil her lands, poison her oceans, blacken her skies. You're killing her.
And?
I wouldn't bet on that.
Of course.  Alfred still keeps your mother's picture in his room.
He's dying.  And I can't deal with it.
Talk to him, Bruce.  There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
Trust me.  Vegetable magnetism.
One kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face.  Their secret identities would be revealed.  But how best to bait a brid?
The way to a boy's heart is through his ego.  What strapping young hero could resist his very own...signal?
Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
Then you never loved me?
Maybe they're right.
Why, indeed?
How are you feeling, young man?
What?
Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man.
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.
Master, Bruce?
And another name for Mystery?
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.
Death.  Death. Without taste, sound and all around us.  Because there is no way for me to save them or myself. This is one giant death trap.
Oh please. You're blind as a bat.
Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
Slanta.
How can I help you, Mr. Wayne?
Psychiatrists make you nervous?
Still play with dolls, Doctor?
She's a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams.  Need one?
My opinion. This letter writer is a total wacko.
So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?
That's usually my line.
But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes.
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous...
There's something I want to talk with you about. It's...Well, we.. I...
I don't-.
Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know.
Hell. Might even bring old Stickley here a few extra bucks. Huh, Fred?
That floor has got to be very hard. Is that better?
Holy shit.
Sure, E = MC squared. Until you factor in more than three dimensions. Then... Damn. Hit us again.
B-12.
How high up would you say that is?
Look! Police!
Can't we --
I'll have to ask you for that film.
The Joker is a murderer. And you were as good as dead. So --
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
Better. It's not on the market yet.
They don't come down here. They're afraid of the lights.
Is this what you wanted?
I assume in my usual charming manner I've just insulted the host.  Alexander Knox.
Bruce Wayne.  -- I've read your work.  I quite like it.
Two drinks and I start swinging from the rooftops.  Look, I bore myself silly.  Let's talk about you. How the hell did you wind up in Corto Maltese?
What did you see?
To tell you the truth, I'd just about given up waiting.
It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --
Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right?  No big loss.
My brother's a priest, man.
Jack?  Thank God.  I can't believe it's you.  I heard you'd been --
And what happens if we say no?
That's it?
I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
You SCUM!  You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her!
Evildoers, huh?  Big or small?
Plain or roasted?  Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.
Yeah?  According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva.  Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.
Not what?
HOLY SHIT!!
Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
Do we know anything about him?
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
0 my god.
Ah, Mr Bean ...
Seems to be a problem with the door. Where's the picture gone?
It wasn't a dream, was it.  I have to go in to work and tell them Whistler's Mother now looks like Danny De Vito.
Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.  Nice guy.  Good looking.
Yes, isn't he.
Love to, sir, but no can do.  No spare room.  Period.
I beg your pardon?
So, why not haul your ...  nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case.
Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
Brilliant, huh?  I already have a prospective buyer - the current Governor of California, no less, who is flies in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal.  Spread the news.  I think decisive leadership has done the trick, don't you?
Bravo.  Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?  Don't want anything to go wrong.
What makes you say that?
It's you and Mom that need to talk.
Well, Michael Bolton's pretty grisly.
Nope.
Come on Sting!
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Beavis, you butt-munch, this guy wants us to score with his wife. And he's gonna pay us. We can buy a new TV.
So, like, where is she?
That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows about fire! Change the channel.
Ow! I'll kick your butt!
Uh... Is this the right bus?
Hey, where'd those chicks go?
Hey Butt-Head, are we gonna die?
Yeah, heh heh. Umm, isn't Seattle in Washington? Heh heh... 'cuz I was thinking maybe we could go see Hole.
Well where is she?!
I always thought there was something wrong with him. Heh heh heh.
You hear that, Beavis! We're gonna get alcohol, tobacco and guns!
Uh, I probably will, but not you. You're too much of a butt-monkey. Huh huh.
I hope to score big there myself. I'm mostly going to be doing the slots.
Oh, there are so many slots you won't know where to begin.
I'm probably going to make out with her first before we, you know, get down...
Really? I poop too much.
Hey, Butt-Head, it's that slut from the plane!
Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
Chief, look!
Where are his pants?
Do her? Huh huh.
Maybe I am three-eighty-five if you carry a second lien!  I can arrange the most creative financing in the six states of New England.
Get <u>away</u> you little monster.
Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.
You saved my -- uh -- life... or whatever... something.
This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know?
Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around <u>people</u>, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
They make gypsies look good.
I don't know if there's anything we can do.
Oh, honey, we may need that.
Are you crazy?  She can't hear you.
God, this is so corny.  Have we been reduced to this?  Sheets?
She's only fourteen...
<u>Adam</u>!  Why did you build a whorehouse?  Have you ever been to...?
You know, I've been thinking.  I could teach Lydia to sew.
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
Oh, Adam, don't tease her.  You never got an A in science in your life!
What?
Aren't you dead?
<u>So</u> you, the dead, want me, <u>the</u> <u>undead</u>, to throw the live guys -- Mommie, Daddy and Lolita, who might not mind a tumble with an older guy, out into the cold? Even though they have paid hard casharoonie for your dump?
<u>Barbara</u>?!!
We tried.
Just one daughter.
Are you Juno, our case worker?
He's a freelance bio-exorcist. Claims to get rid of the living. But he's a troublemaker.  He's pushy.  He's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
The whorehouse was my idea. I want Betelgeuse out of the picture!  We've got some serious talking to do.
If I had seen a ghost at your age, I would have been frightened out of my wits.
You're not gross.  Why were you wearing a sheet?
Yeah.
Three syllables.
That's it!
What do you think, honey?
Dad.  Do you believe me?
Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
They're... not here anymore.
Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese could <u>run</u> it for us.  Build them a dormitory in the woods.  Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you.
I don't care from guilt.  I just want to <u>see</u> them.
Lydia, I will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors.  You help us with these ghosts or you'll be sorry.
That was the single most unattractive window treatment I have ever seen in the entire of my existence.
What's wrong?
<u>I know</u>... I read your book, <u>The</u> <u>Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf</u>.
Is there much more of this torture?
Are they still here, Otho?
What's happening to them?
They don't want to come down.
An attorney?
Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
I'll send Wilson up to take you for X-rays, Mr. Gardiner. Feel free to use the telephone, and please let me know if you have any discomfort.
... Were you going somewhere?
Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.
I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
I see.  Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word.
Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers.
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Yes, I have seen that show on television.
Yes. I would like to be on that show.
There's no need for a hospital.
These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident. Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before.
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen that before.
Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
Oh, no. She brought me my meals.
Yes. That could be true.
Yes.
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy.
Do you think so? Do you think so?
Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
Yes. I like that name very much.
Yes, Eve. That would be good.
We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
Chauncey, up and around this morning, are you?
And, please, Chauncey - don't rush your decision. I know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment.
Certainly, Ben.
Oh, I see.
I can't write.
Of course, who can nowadays? I have trouble writing a post card to my children! Look, we could give you a six figure advance, provide you with the very best ghostwriter, research assistants, proof readers...
How about taxes, Mr. Chance, surely you must have paid taxes?
... Evening, Chance.
... Back up those stairs - damn... That Man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again...
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
You're welcome.
You live here?  ... We don't have any record of that.
Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas?
Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address -- a Driver's License, a credit card, checkbook?
I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.
I have no claim, Thomas.
Try again.
No headaches?
No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.
I'm becoming quite attached to Chauncey - quite attached...  ... And so are you, aren't you, Eve.
... Yes, I am, Ben.
Eve, child! How nice of you to come.
... How are the kids getting along?
Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...
It's that gardener!
What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible.
Yes, sir - we are aware of all that, but still, we haven't been able to...
I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.
But we are quite certain, comrade, that this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction planning a coup d'etat.
Thank you, Colonel.
... Well?
Well, Ben... I...
It's that serious, huh?
Thank you.
I don't know.
Enjoy.
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
Hi.
I have to go back now.
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?
Tell her, what the hell, close early today, live dangerously.
I'm sorry for everything.
I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
I know.
Maxine...
Simulates?
Schwartz.
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea what you're saying right now.
Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know.
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
One hundred and five. Carrot juice.  Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.
No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.
Is that true?
Yes, well...
How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight.
Hi.
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
I'll be with you always, my friends. Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll rejoin you with wings and a beak.
Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
You can be John Malkovich.
And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.
The Great Mantini?
I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
Do you dream often?
I'm sure you're not going crazy.
You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
I'm getting divorced.
No you mustn't, my child.
You followed your heart, my child, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.
You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear.
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.
Yeah, I saw them
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
Come on in.
Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
I've got to leave Malkovich.
Honey, we can be happy and poor together.
Captain Mertin?
I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.
Why you never go back to Lady Jone's and learn your letters? You liked going there I remember. Seeing the other children. Then all a sudden, you stop.
If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.
You getting into bed to think about yellow?
Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what?
I'm saying they came into my yard.
I don't know. Maybe we should have moved.
Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did...
WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
Oh.
Work? Start learnin your letters again?
I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
She likes this dress...
It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.
Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of.
Till she showed herself.
You planning to do anything about it?
I said I had two things to say to you. I only told you one. I have to tell you the other.
Leave off..
Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning.
Look here..There's a cross up there, so I guess this here's a church or used to be. Seems to me like you ought to show it some respect, you follow me?
Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
Pin your diapers on, Lebowski.  Jackie Treehorn wants to see you.
Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude.
Here's the money, and the phone. Please, Dude, follow whatever instructions they give.
Uh-huh.
Oh, man, don't say that..
This is our concern, Dude.
That had not occurred to us, Dude.
Visiting friends of hers in Palm Springs.  Just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Zere ARE no ROOLZ!
Sir, please lower your voice--
Sheesh.
Were you listening to the Dude's story?
If what's during league play?
Shut the fuck up, Donny!  V.I. Lenin! Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!
They posted the next round of the tournament--
I'm shomer shabbas.
What have you.  We'll, uh--
Hey, is this him with Nancy?
Yes, heh--
And what do you do, sir?
...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But it's nice when they offer.
I like your style, Dude.
Well I like your style too, man. Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.
Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off manually.
Sex.  The physical act of love. Coitus.  Do you like it?
I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
Lord.  You can imagine where it goes from here.
Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor.
From who?
Jeffrey.
Uh-huh.
Jeffrey--
It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just--
What the fuck are you--
Theodore Herzel.
Hey Walter--
You mean--beyond pacifism?
Just, just take it easy, Walter.
Just for making the hand-off?
...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so whenever these guys call--
Walter, face it, there isn't any connection.  It's your roll.
Ya see?  Nothing is fucked up here, Dude.  Nothing is fucked.  These guys are fucking amateurs--
Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?
I told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling?
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
Whose toe was it, Walter?
I figure my only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off.
That makes me feel all warm inside.
What're you, a fucking park ranger now?
No, I'm--
--We're sympathizing here, Dude--
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
Yeah.
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up--
I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.
Yeah, and you were--
Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal, there never was any money.  The big Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, man, so take it up with him.
Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!
Wha.
WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!
Shut the fuck up.  Hello?
Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--
You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
C'mon man, who're you gonna believe? Those guys are--we dropped off the damn money--
Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy wife, I mean, in the parlance of our times, owes money all over town, including to known pornographers-- and that's cool, that's cool-- but I'm saying, she needs money, and of course they're gonna say they didn't get it 'cause she wants more, man, she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean-- hasn't that ever occurred to you...? Sir?
Shit, sorry man.
I'm not--
You happy, you crazy fuck?
Tom here's my ninth hard felon of the month. Six weeks he'll be sucking gas. In three years I'll be working Central Warrants. Jewboy Deputy D.A. over there wets his pants for fighters. Promised me the next spot he can wangle.
Whatta we do about the Mex?
<i>You'll</i> take him.
What the hell are you doing, Blade?
If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
Like cancer with a purpose.
Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're all dead.
Why do you hate us so much?
I thought you were supposed to be watching our backs.
Where were you, Whistler?
The genetic material you spliced into Nomak --  Where did you get it?
True, but thanks to you, we know his weakness.  We can keep him contained. It's just a matter of time before we hunt him down.
Kiss your ass goodbye, Reinhardt.
Listen, hillbilly, you are a cunt-hair away from cowboy heaven.
What the fuck you doing?
His name is Jared Nomak.
We're locked in.
Any casualties?
You worry too much, Stevens.  I have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted.
Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
What about you?  You're not coming?
And you honestly expect me to believe all this?
But, he could've --
Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
How can you tell?
So many of them -- I still can't believe they're real.
What is this place?
I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts I wasn't human.
Any progress?
But you -- died --
How could you be a part of this?
Then what is it?
I thought you promised to give me some distance?
Five minutes, not a second more. And I don't want to hear a word about "us".
That's weird --
I see. And what would you have us do with this "half-breed"?
You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
No offense, Whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed something.
'Give you a hand. I think my sleep for the night just ended.
--Jamie Kurth, Jonathan Edmunds--
I was out hiking, camping the past two days--that's what did it--<u>I</u> killed it--
--I'm not staying here!
Where they found the backpacks and all the film a year later.
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
What?
--or someone--
Nothing. I dunno--
Little boys. Looking up my skirt as I danced. Giggling.
I don't know what it is, but there is something <u>happening</u> here, and it's starting to scare the living shit out me, and look, I'm just <u>not</u> going to argue the point anymore--you want to stay here, stay, but I've got to get the fuck out of here, and I'm begging you to come <u>with</u> me.
You're gonna owe me the rest of your life, bud.
Absolutely.
--Christ, they find out I let you have it for the weekend--
I'm the ebay Boy, remember? I can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.
What?
Used to be a meat-packing plant. Slaughter on the ground floor-- carcasses schlepped up on this thing for dissection and grinding and--
Where <u>is</u> it?
The moon trying to shoot down through all these trees--can make things funky--
For "James?"
--Cotter--
What--
Well, she's got to be <u>somewhere</u> here.
--it's less than four feet, just--
What?
We're doing dusk-till-dawn taping of all the places where there've been alleged Blair Witch "sightings" --the Parr House, Coffin Rock, Tappy Creek.
That's almost a year's worth of work!  Scumbags! Oh, Jesus, Jesus....
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
--bullshit--
I'm sorry.
Domini.
Gothic rune--the letter "S."
--or Lyme Disease or poison sumac, or God knows what-else we could have picked up in the woods.
There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
...Ray?
What?
...I can find a place tomorrow, then I'll be outta your hair.
Yeah? What happened?
Thanks.
...You ever get tired?
...Ray?
Why didn't you get into bed?
...You leaving?
...But first I gotta know what happened.
Listen, I got tickets for the Oilers and the Rams next week in the Astrodome. Ever sat on the fifty yard line?
It'll pass.
We don't seem to be communicating--
I told you. I like you.
Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
Yeah.
I want that money. If you wanna tell me something, fine--
You called me, I knew they were there, so what do I need these for?
Red Label.
That's not the point.
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
Thanks Meurice.
...Why?
What?
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go.
To your health, Frank.
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
Come into the study a minute.
Detective Williams here. yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day. when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though. I can't.
Yes?
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon.  I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different.  He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
Hello, baby.
. mommy's here.
Look at these. What are these?
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
Frank. he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. come on. He didn't mean it.
Frank gone?
Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
GET OUT OF THERE!! GET OUT!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name?. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
Do you like that?
Do you like talk like that?
You can hit me, if you want to.
I made it go down the toilet.
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?
Do you know?
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but. I like you.
Who is Don?
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. if you need to. come to where I live. O.K.?
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like me, huh?
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
Okay. I know you've been scared. now you want to scare someone.
Beeeee careful.
I asked first.
Yes.
Why are you here?  Hmmmmmmmm!!!! Ok.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
I've gotta go in.
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
You didn't goof it up, but. you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday. do you have a date tonight?
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Brilliant.
That sounds good.
O.K.
. Actually. I've been in twice.
Did you see her undressed?
Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. but I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
Okay. be careful.
Goodnight.
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Jeffrey!!
Jeffrey?. Why?
You didn't tell him about me?
It's okay.
Dorothy Vallens?
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone. the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Do you want the car?
No. No thank you.
I've been holding this shit for him for three weeks.  You tell Diego I don't appreciate it.  You tell him I want my money by Friday.  Can you do that?
Where do you guys want to count?
On the plane.
Motherfucker works fast.
Blanca, por favor.
You happy, baby?
You wanna split?
Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not a chance.  So, what's the verdict?
What?  You're not going to wait for me?
George, I went to the doctor.  I don't have two years.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon, correct?
Really.  Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?
My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.
We want some grass.
What the fuck is that?
No.
You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred pounds a week.
I don't know...
I want my kid out of protective custody. Now.  No fucking around.  My wife and my kid on a plane tonight.  I sign when they call me safe and sound.
No fucking way.
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
George?  What do you know about cocaine?
Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.
Now do you see what I am saying?
Yeah, I'm out.
But you must.  It's the only way.
This is only part of the business, George.  A very small part.  Don't worry, there is so much more to do. Which reminds me, I need a favor from you.  I must go to Colombia.
No more brothers, Diego.
Take your boots off.  You're tan.
Tell him I don't want to see him.  Tell him he's not welcome here.
I just can't get over the size of that ring.  I just love it.  Fred, look at it.  Tell me you don't love that ring.
Un rata - no good.  But he could have run, fled the country.  Gone to the policia.  But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die.
But, never mind.  I am thinking we can do much together.  This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business.  To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem.  And I don't like problems.
Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George?
Not mad.
Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.
Give this to Mom, will you?
Tell Mom, you know...
What the fuck?  Is he going to walk?
Don't be stupid, George.  We've got him. We've got him dead to rights.  But like I said, this is top priority so we're handing out free passes on this one. And the first one's got your name on it. Cut your sentence in half, maybe more.
George.
Source?  What about Derek?
Why are you smiling?
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
Pablo said no?
What?
You should have taken better care of me, you know?  You've been away a long time. Four years.  Say something.
Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going.
Hey, look.  You start paying, who knows what will happen.  You're a good father, George.  I always gave you that.  But you've got to talk to her.
Mirtha, what's going on?  Everything okay with Kristina?
Mirtha, how are you doing?
Well, here I am.  See?
You mean, like a trip?
Yeah.  Go out there, check it out, see what it's like.  I've got some stuff to do this week, but I'm thinking maybe Thursday.  Thursday after school.
Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?
Mr. Jung, can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?
Who's the co-pilot?
Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
Not that far, only halfway.  You sure you know what you're doing?
Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine. Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a thousand.  It's all there.  Wow.  A hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars.
Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers, but also of the methods that they have employed ... Can you tell us something about this?
It is an inevitable stage in revolutionary war; from terrorism, one passes to insurrection ... as from open guerrilla warfare one passes to real war, the latter being the determining factor ...
Sid Ahmed.
Which "district" do you belong to?
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
Why? Isn't he sleeping here?
To show them to the UN, right?
It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.
Bah, for that matter, Algeria isn't the only country in the world ...
Who is speaking?
How can I give you this statement?
Joe Koehler.  I know him.  He's an estate attorney -- and he's very expensive.
Here it is!  According to the old will Joanne Braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
So she knew about his heart?
I think I'm going to make your day.
What are you saying, Henry?  That his girlfriend fucked him to death?
Cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want.
Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
What induced it?
I don't think so.  The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.
-- And if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?
It would be an added stress to his heart.
Yes.
Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
Your Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover of Miss Lawson's.
Can you?
We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
Objection, Your Honor.  The fact that Mrs. Crawford heard Mr. Troxell reconstruct her sentence and decided to rephrase her words in a more intelligent manner for the court doesn't mean the incident never happened.
I'm talking to you as a friend now. Don't ruin your life, your career for her.  She'll spit you out when this is over.
Objection!  Mr. Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.
Miss Braslow -- I'm District Attorney John Cardenas.  You arrived at what time tonight?
Her name?
No -- but I can get it for you.
Who found him?
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh to your office?
Yes.
We were lovers.
For about one year.
Yes.
What kind of information?
You can suggest anything you want. It happened.
Don't you see what she's doing?  She needs you to kill me.  She's planned it that way from the start.  That's why she phoned me tonight.
I'm sure that every orgasm she had with me was faked.
No.
Oriental medicine.
Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year.
Did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps?
Did you go to college, Mrs. Crawford?
Where did you meet him?
What happened?
If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?
So, the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving.  That must cause tremendous anxiety. Sleepless nights.  Incredible stress.
That bastard!
--and that he changed his will?
There's an item you picked up that's marked.  Will you read it?
You didn't know about it before that?
Frank -- what are you doing here?
Would it be fair to say that when she did find out it was a shock to her?
And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me.  That's why I need a very good lawyer, Mr. Dulaney.
Have you ever seen animals make love, Mr. Dulaney?  They have such passion -- such savage emotion.  They struggle, and snarl, and claw, but neither hurts the other.  Not really.
Can we get out of here?
I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.
Sorry.
I hardly know him.  He wanted me and he couldn't have me.
Something wrong?
I'm glad you have such confidence in me.
Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.
That wasn't the deal.
Yeah.
Why did you lie to me?
I was thinking that when the trial is over we'd all go skiing for a weekend.
Don't use language like that at the dinner table.
I didn't know that Andrew was dead until Mr. Sattler called me at home that night.
It had to get there somehow.
SO!
I am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what I've done!
Eeeww!
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
I found out who Lucy Delaney is.  Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
Yeah. But I thought she died.
I never knew that.
Was this during Betty?
What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.
My niece had "the changes" when she was thirty-one.
Oh, this heat! Times like this I wish we took that offer from your brother and moved on up to Michigan.
Not this kind of heat.
Pretty country.
Are you from Washington originally?
You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
Men sill give women flowers, don't they? I mean, as a sign of appreciation? I'm not that out of date, am I?
Want another cigarette?
Francesca.
Mind if I smoke?
I'm so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason.
A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.
I doubt that.
But I... We don't even know each other.
"Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?
I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
And did you?
Have no fear. This Shoshone Medicine Woman taught me how to make bug repellent tea out of tree root.
You want to go back in?
Francesca?
I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
I told you, I love other people.
But no one in particular.
I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.
My mistake. I apologize.
Francesca?
Okay. See you later.
Yeah?
Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
On that one is beautiful. Look at their expressions. As if the camera weren't on them at all. As if they had no strength left to hide what they were feeling.
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
What?
I was honest with you. I told you who I was.
How do you know what I experience?
I know you! What can this possibly mean to anyone who doesn't "need" meaning -  "Who goes with the Mystery" -- who pretends he isn't scared to death.
What do you want me to say?
Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
I'm going to be here a few more days. I'll be at the Inn. We have some time. Let's not say any more now.
Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! Is it true Cary Grant has proposed to you?
You feeling better Franny?
It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.
I'm positive.
Hmm. How about that brown sugar meat loaf you make?
Hey, kid.
We practically paying him for the privilege of playing his club.
The man said just to use my imagination.  Let's see...yeah, I get it.  Potential. I can see it now.  The first major urban theme park.  Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials.  Totally E-ticket.
You didn't hear that?  "Take him... " Something.  "Bury him" or...
What the hell you talking about?
Where's the others?
Where's the gangsta of love?
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Wh-wh-whooo?
Yeah, we used to do the after-school b ball at Kenwood.  What it is?
Maybe I oughtta get there a little early. For good luck.
Hey Jimmy, you know Eddie Mack, don't you?
How did you get in here?
If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.
no really, let us help.  We're new in the neighborhood, gonna be neighbors.
Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
The dead get out?
Here, find my hand.  The stairs are right near here.  I saw them.  Let's just walk up there.
But maybe we're the ones who should be down there.  Doing something.  Making it better.
It's...it's a bad neighborhood.  As you can see now.
Please...help me...
I been watching you.  You done good. Invested wisely.  Respectable businessman now.  Just like you always wanted.
That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
Nice rack.  How old is --
No way man...
Not your style.  Is it Eddie?  Killing off your customers?
12-year olds.  They scare easy.  Anyway, he's gonna tip their stash.  Come with me.
Oh, no.  Please don't make me go by myself.  I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride?
That's all we did, steal their ride.
Sqweeep.  We innerup this programme to bring you this special news bulletin --  "Aliens from Reticula 3 have hijacked Patrick Peet and injected moly headcheese into his skull filling his entire brain cavity with cosmic slop..."
He was a local legend back in the '70's. There was a song, Stagolee kinda deal: "This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stone..."
Need any help with those bags, Ma'am?
But the place burned to the ground.
Evidence of what?
You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!
Just admit it, Caesar.
You're a dead man!  A fucking dead man!
All part of the business.
Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar.
That doesn't make any sense.
It couldn't have been.
No.
If you're not with me, Violet, then I have to assume you're against me.
Tell them!  Tell them!
...  maybe three hours.
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
What happened to them?
Fuck.
Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!
You murdered Gino!
Fuck, this happened before.  It's this shitty ear.  Born with it.  The batteries wore out in my aid.  I'm sorry.
You planned this whole thing, didn't you?
What?  How about a drink?
Is that the money?
Hey, Caesar, where's the key?
The key, yeah, the key's in my pants in the bathroom.
So this is temporary for you?
Mmmm ...  thanks, I needed this.
You're doing everything yourself?
Do you know him?
Thank you so much.  You have to let me pay you something --
You seem uncomfortable.  Do I make you nervous, Corky?
Are you surprised that I know what it is?
Look, I don't think this is a good idea.
You have to ask?
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.
Oh no, she's nothing like you.  She's a lot smarter than you.
Do you think you know me like that?
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
Why?
Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money?
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
What time did you say they would be there?
Where will you be?
If it's real enough, he'll believe it, because deep down he'll want to.
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
That's okay, as long as he believes it was Johnnie.
I'm sorry, Corky ...
You know what the difference is between us, Violet?
Pop?
We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone.  Was this Treadstone?
You're asking me a direct question?
And what if I couldn't do that?
We've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. We've been <u>sleeping</u> down here.  We just got our first lead fourteen hours ago, and now? -- now that we <u>finally</u> have something to work with -- you want to bring planning personnel down here?  I'd rethink that.
I'm going to Paris.
Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
<u>Was this a game or a fuck up</u>?
I have a passport.  I've got...  Actually, it's a little complicated.
Yes, sir...  How can I help you?
You call about Monsieur Kane?  John Michael Kane?
It's very bad this.  Terrible sad. Such a young man.
Mr. Kane...  Come right in...please...have a seat.
Did you?
Was it the break-in?
I said ten thousand.
What does that mean?
Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
I can't believe I slept.
Four-fifty.  That's the address...
Okay, so...
Look, I don't know what's up there.
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
-- I don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --
<u>So what are we doing</u>?
It doesn't matter who you were before.  It's who you want to be. That's all that matters.  We have this money.  We have what we have.  I had nothing before and now, I don't know, maybe I have more, maybe it's nothing, but...  I say we leave here.  We leave this place.  We go until we can't go anymore.

xxxxxx
Yes.
It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
-- let's check that Interpol window again --
It doesn't matter now.  We've just got to be the first ones there.  Get everybody up.  I want them all activated.
-- we're evacuating the building --
<u>Where am I</u>?
Look, I'm just on this boat, okay? I'm an engineer.  Whatever this is, it's not for me to be involved, okay?
You drink rum?
...elephoned sir.
Well not exactly. But, if you help us we'll help you. The Forces Of Darkness have won the day ... but, tomorrow is another one
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old fashioned virtues. They just can't stand seeing the other fellow win. If these people would just play the game, instead of standing on the touch line heckling -
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ...
Where's Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she?!
Problem? - No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded -
For my sins. Are you settling in alright?
Enough though, eh?
Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should be shot for that. So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake.
Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.
What's she done?
Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.
You're the only person I can trust.
There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.
No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
Where do I get it stamped?
You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?
Are you alright?
What are you doing? For Christ's sake! Get moving!
It's my fucking life.
It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
Well, all wars do -
Who is this war against, Sam?
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
Turn around!
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
"And your children all gone."
Jill! What are you do ... I mean ... how did you ... Are you alright?
Your face ... are you hurt?
Are you sure?
Don't you like parties?
Isn't it? Whose is it?
Would you really, Sam?
Really.
Tuttle?
He is dead.
You'd never get away with it. Besides, you can't do that to somebody's refund. It's Christmas. There is one more option.
Here. What do I do next?
Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's cheque?
You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you?
I did it for you.
Sam Lowry.
Ah.  Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console?
Sod it, it's broken!
It's a refund ... I'm afraid there was a mistake.
Mistake?
Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets go of the parcel and pushes JILL away. She moves off.
Er, yes ...
Sign here please.
Are you expecting anyone?
Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one.  Sorry.  I said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself.
I feel for you, but we got an emergency here. It's a weekend of full moons.  Everyone's called in sick. Larry, Veeber, Stanley too. We need bodies out there. I had to put Marcus on Twelve Young. You know he's not supposed to work two nights in a row.
No ...
She's having a baby. Twins.
Es impossible.
You can trust me on this one.
Frank Pierce.
I'm always interested in people in stressful occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as I can imagine. Here, sit down. What's it like? Tell me some war stories.
That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these.
You're going to live.
No.
I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
Don't worry, hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me.
Male diff breather, approximately 30, Houston and A.
That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime.
What the hell.  The next year, tiebreaker for the division, in Boston, Yanks down two to nothing, Bucky Dent steps to the plate.
Is he going to be alright?
Is there any chance?
Even when you say the things, there's always more things.
Did you see my father?
Yes?
How is she?
You married?
It's been bad lately, but it's always bad.
Frank.
She's no whore, Marcus.
It's not worth it, Tom. He's surrendering.
Where you going?
Relax, it's a street job, easy except for the smell. We'll just throw him in back and zip over to Mercy--no blood, no dying, that's how I look at it. He's just a drunk.
They'll just keep calling.
Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls.
Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight.
You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.
One-three Zebra. Zebra three, I need you.
Keep it to yourself.
Shut up a second...
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
No.  That's not going to tell us anything.  Let's get this prompter going.
I don't like the word gay.
Which would you prefer?
He must have been great-looking, right?
Sure.
Nine seconds.
Aaron, will you tell me?
It was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again.  Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?
What?
I know you care about him.  I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil.
Don't say anything about anything.
You are now required to sit here with me.  Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?
I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor.
Your hair's a little funny.
We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased.  All right?
Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
Jane?
I've got to tell Ernie...because there isn't enough time.
Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'
No, I don't think so.
I've been doing some morning show stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't bother me.  I'm in no rush for anything.  It's just the snotty attitude, even if I have it coming, it's still...
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating being a news source.
I broke up with my roommate -- He was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything.
Oh.
Tell me I'm on the way in.
No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.
I trust you.
Uh-huh.
I've got another story.
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.  I have it cold, confirmed.  They have five million dollars in this thing already.
Billion.
At work there's always this sort of film over you.
Jennifer, you want to have another drink?
I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.
Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
I'm not sure I dialed right -- Jane?
Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
Nooo.  Is it your story?
Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like to go.
It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
Suppose I go in for a little while and you wait in the lobby-bar.  How's that?
You're not going to take off on me, are you?
That's not it.
Well, when?
Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
Why?
It just proves that the difference we have are...
It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that...
Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything.
I sure know that feeling.  Terrific work today.
It's kind of dark -
I'm almost ready -
Oh it's enough...
Are you nervous, Walter?
What!
May I please have another little kiss?
Walter!  Jeez!
Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
You think I'm creative?
Why not?!
Walter...there's...
I hope this was made with egg whites!
Walter...I can't believe it.
You've arrived.  You've been recognized.  You're a talent, a creative force to be reckoned with.
That's the idea, Walter.  It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
Look at that, man.  Big deal.
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
H-have a seat?
I thought I'm not supposed to sit with the customers...
Well...why murdered man?
Walter...Walter listen carefully.  I don't want you to make any more statues.  Do you understand? No more statues.
Listen to me...I don't want to lose this piece -
I got you cold, pal.  Make it easy for yourself, use your head.
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
I know that - I know that! I also believe in burning the creative candle, you understand, down to the end - to be uncreative you might as well be dead...a walking machine, toiling in a factory!
I want you to have it.  There's a little something for you in here...
Gee.  Thanks.
Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker.
Don't tell me I didn't hear a racket!  I'm an older woman and I don't need to be upset and disturbed in this manner!
What's wrong with you!?!
Come on, come on, fork up the scub.
I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you.
Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!
I'm hungry.
My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
Yeah?
Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.
Buffy, what are you doing here?
I thought we were meeting here.
You weren't home.  Like always.
You left me a message?
Ah, my fool is dead.  He was careless, always.  Still, I'll pull out your tongue for that.  Don't you understand?  I've killed you a dozen times.  Your life is not a blink of my eye, not a single breath.  I have lived in the shadows, in the pulsing filth behind men's eyes.  A thousand years, and more. I have conversed with the worms that fed on my corpse and I have bathed in the blood of emperors.
This?  This is you only weapon? Your puny faith?
Can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe?
How are you doing?
Yeah.
Hey, jeez are you okay?  You need a hand?
Things are kind of confusing.
I know.
Pike, I don't think you're up to this.
I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.
Come again?
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch.
Like what?
You look way pretty, Kim.
Am I in trouble or something?
You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?
Who we gonna beat?
Oh.  Sorry.
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
You are such a wet.
Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The one and only?  The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  Like, ever?
Do you know how many girls I've trained to be Slayers?  Five.  Five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight -- harder than you've ever worked in your life -- and I saw them ripped apart.  Do you want to live?  Do you?
So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
It's what I was raised to do.  There aren't many of us left, the Watchers.
I wish you would.
As for example, what?
Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
There isn't time.
Mr. Howard is so heinous.  He's always giving me a hard time.  I get a C-plus on the test and he tells me, 'You have no sense of history.'  I have no sense of history?  He wears a brown tie.
Yeah... She's okay, though.
My parents have money...
You think so?
Got that.
Write that down.
Oh, yes!  Yes!
Well, I'm done.  Are you done?
Okay, let's go.
She was even crazier after that.  I mean it, you wouldn't even have recognized her.
It's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch.
You said "Crash".
Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever.  Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.
I know what it is.
Fundamentals?
He did?
It's Skip, for you.
Well I guess this is it.
I got lured.
Yep.
Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
Well, Annie, your place or mine?
He' s confused--
I want to be had.
And now you wanta teach me?
Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60?
Why not?
Annie---
Number twenty-two's thighs are just great.  Who's he?
Oh no--he's shaking off the sign, Jackson.  Big mistake...
No ballplayer ever said "no" to a date with me.
Good--then listen.  "I sing the body electric.  The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them--"
What's that?
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Drive off your back leg.  You pitch with your legs as much as your arms-
Why you shaking me off?
Well, I held it like an egg.
You could be one of those guys-- but you don't give a fuck, Meat.
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
Anybody says anything bad about Millie, I'll break his neck.
I'm going to the Show.
C'mon, we got nothin' to fight about.
Forget it.
You will.  Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it.  Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat.  That's the secret.  You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
I don't need a crazy woman in my life.
Yeah, Skip, you wanted to see me?
No way.
We fight, she gets the clown-- how's that happen?
Well tell 'em, honey.
No.  The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.
He walked eighteen?!
He's got a million dollar arm and a five cent head.
Well, I'd rather not say.
Goddamn, that's great!  Jesus!  Listen, Crash don't like anybody to know it but--  Most nights he goes down to, you know, down to Niggertown.  To Sandy's...  the whorehouse.
Hi, Ace.
You don't have to have a license to work in a casino. All you gotta do is apply for one. The state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application. They got a ten-year backlog.
...been right, but who knows?
Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again.
She's my wife.  Look at me. You did know that, didn't you? You knew that she's my wife? Huh? Hey, look at me.
She's not here, Sam.
You understand? Put her on the fuckin' phone.
Right away.
Oh. Have a good day at school.
Mommy.
After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. And then... he hit me with it.
You mean, I have your permission?
What?
But I'll tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds. He knew all the fuckin' angles. He brought over the whole 'Femme Fatale' show from Paris. But he forgot how lazy them European dancin' broads can get. I mean, he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons.
Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this?
Hello.
Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about, huh? You know!  If you're actin' like this now, how can I depend on you?  There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way.
You should say so.
I'll be honest with you.
What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
Yeah.
No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.
Listen, I would -
She came to talk to me...
Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you.
No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
...you? Do you remember what I told you?
I know. Why didn't you come to me? I mean, this is family, it ain't business. Meanwhile, you make calls back home. Sammy, it makes us look bad out here, you know what I mean? Back and forth, this one and that one, and, in the meantime, she's gone anyway. Am I right?
I don't know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don't know...  She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.
No, I'm not okay.
Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?
You've got to stop her.
But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.
Sam, we got a problem.
She took care of the dealers...
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
What're you... what're you pitching me, here?
Yeah.
It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right?
Yeah.
You sure?
You're so wonderful. The jewelry's not so bad, either.
You can trust me.
You can't make me stop caring...
Okay.
...please. That's all I'm askin' you.
Uh,  I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know.
Right.
I gotta tell ya...
And...
...the rest of the two million is still there?
So, what'd ya do with it?
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
The good part was, I had Amy back. So, we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed, I calmed myself down and we went to dinner. I tried to keep things nice and civil, you know.  But... hey, twenty-five thousand for three suits? That doesn't make much sense.
Yeah.
I want you out of here! I want you out of here!
Take your  fuckin' bag and get out of here!
Here. Here. Is this enough money?! Huh?  Will it last you two fuckin' days? Take it, greedy bitch.  Take the fuckin' money you fuckin' want.
Yeah, no kidding. Good! It opens at 9 a.m. Be there!
Fine.  I'm takin' Amy.
I am not! She's my daughter too! Goddamn you!
To the Riviera.
Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I'm gonna listen in on the other line.
Get - get up!
Oh, you are...
What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?
...Well, I've got a large family.
It won't happen again, Sam.
What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden.
Well...
Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?
I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands?
You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
Get out of here.
Fuckin' kids at home!  Here.  Get the fuck out of here.
I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.
I was out there with my cumma [Italian- American slang for 'girlfriend'.]
I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
Hi. Good.
Can I go in?
No, you can, you can.  You've been so nice to me.
You - You fuckin' moron, I'll be filling out paper work for the next two months because of you and this piece of shit, you...
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Here we go!
You took your boots off? You put your feet on the table... you shit- kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you!  You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert! You understand?  Go over there and apologize.  Go! Get the fuck out of -
You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does.
He's gone?
He's not here?
Yeah, I'm over here with him.
Carmine? He was here before. I saw him. He had a suitcase and everything, and then he left.
Calm down! Calm down!
And I mean... that's no good.
No. I ain't see anything like that.
Ace.
Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian- American slang for 'Come here']
I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
He gives a fuck what I do?
I don't - 
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah. 'Cause, you know,  He's never gonna give me my jewelry.
Yeah.  Boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he?
All right. Be careful.
You fucked with me for the last time!
I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
Come on.
All right.
You are.
Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.
Right.
I just talked to him.
Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!
Get up.
Sometimes I used to go along on a heist just for the fun of it. But I didn't like the people I was rippin' off lookin' at me, so I used to turn their fuckin' pictures around.
Mm.
Nah. You would've heard somethin'.
Get out. Get out! Get out!
I fucked up, Frankie. I fucked up good this time. Should have never started with this fuckin' broad.
Listen to me, Anthony. I got your head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name. Don't make me have to do this, please. Come on. Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on.
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
You're a little confused?
Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
I can't take this no more. Back and forth, back and forth.
I still have to call my agent--my techno-single just made the hot 100...what's with the phone?
I'm not going to worry about it. We are quite beyond the computer disc. Everything will be over within the next hour or so.
A whip?  Now that's going too far!  Some of these women have no shame!
Your warehouse?  Go on ahead--to your "warehouse." I'll be okay...
Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
Oh now, you put up a good fight. Let's change the subject. Where do people who live in Oasisburg go to get away from it all?
She has a real spirit.
I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
"Dat's gotta hurt!"
Right time. That was kind of fun. She had spunk.
I don't know, Boss, you saw what the big guy did to the last kitty we gave him.
Car wash, Captain?
My, the Perpetrator seems to be a bit on the "Wild" side..
A superhero's job is to protect society.  Don't blame me if society is a horrible, corrupt joke.
Ah, the good guys always triumph in the end. It's what allows our children to sleep at night.
You know, my name's not Spooky. It's, it's Rachel.
You Housewives have no idea what we go through!
Ah!  You scared me!  How did you know to come here!  Have you been spying..
I was doing my job. At the risk of sounding egotistical, I didn't become the best reporter in the world sitting by the phone. I was chasing tail all night--I was not spying, intentionally, on your hot and heavy date with "Brock Leviathan, architect."  I can't believe he ordered white wine.  You do know white wine is not real wine...
Don't sneak up on me...
I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same.
I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...you have such pretty eyes...
Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
What's it like being a superhero?  It must be frightfully exciting..How did you guys all get together?
I'm not sad, no, I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush.
What was that for?
So what?  What could be important enough to put your hands on me?
In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
Which is why we had a lot more to worry about than the law.  These are people who don't worry about reading you your rights.
We have never worked a gig together but I am a firm believer in preparation.  So let's go over this again step by step.
What do you mean tip the cops?  Is the man a lunatic or what?
In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.
I thought you said you could handle him.
And what're you whispering for?
Lady, try making some sense.
Well isn't there a number on the goddam phone?
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
Oh man.  These people mean business.
Fine, no tunnel.  Are you still with me?  Hello?
I'm with two friends now.
Stop throwing names at me.
Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
Hello?  It's just me and you again.
What are you doing now?
A woman?
What do you do for a living?
No.
She's gone --
He's copying down my license -- for all the good it'll do him.
I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
You're doing what you can.  Why's all this money stashed?
You can't give up.
Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?
Why can't it be her?
At least one.
Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
Who's in back?
Do you have to point that?
Granted, the cops are not an alternative.  Certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk.
I don't hear him moving around anymore.
What's that supposed to me?
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
259-7881.
That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
Developer ran out of money years back.  I'd hate to think about what's living in there.
Who'd ever think, to look at you?
You're the man with the gun.
I'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house.  It may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone.
Just sitting here listening to her voice does it to me all over again.  No harm admitting I fell in love with the sound of you.
It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
Who is this?
What time frame have you got in mind?
It's in the process.
Soon as Mrs. Oberfeld is in my car I'll toss out your first third. Then I'll back up 200 feet to behind the public restroom.
That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
From what I can see you're a pretty fair wheelman.  There's a hairpin coming up -- that's the place for it. The cops'll plow right into you.
I thought you'd know me by now.
And make ourselves a hell of a target.
Better haul ass if we're gonna be inside to greet them.
Somebody better tear this down before it falls down.
Them.  They won't be expecting us.
Seems not.
What kind of Treasury Dept. business is this?
Undercover.
Scottish?
So who's he?
Then why doesn't she?
You could always make it up to her.
What you think?
That's what he said. Jimmy.
Good thing in a man.
Don't want any of those looks, Col. They don't mean much.
Stop it, Dil --
Fuck off, Dave.
Thank you.
Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt.
Look, I'm sorry.
Doesn't the water get to your nails?
The accent, I suppose.
Everybody wants something.
You old-fashioned?
You all right?
Yes, thank you.
That Dave?
Piss off, Dave!
Must be in love to manage that.
He lived here with you?
Tell me about him.
Are you jealous of him?
Didn't think I could.
Sorry, darling.
You could?
You think that's wise?
I didn't mean to hit you.
I should have known, shouldn't I?
Happy now?
You gonna tell me why?
I'm not sure.
No.
Whatever you say, Dil.
Say it again.
What's Fergus?
Dil!!!
You've got to go now, Dil --
I promise.
What was it?
A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
Did you give him it?
Eddie and Tinker died.
He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back. I tried to catch him. He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen.
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
No way, Jude. I'm out.
Jude?
You a handyman, Fergie?
I take pride in my work.
Dil!
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
You sure?
Thanks.
And who's Dave when he's at home?
I understand.
Definitely unusual.
Hope not.
Could you?
Do what?
She'd be anyone's type.
You make a nice couple.
Ever see hurling?
That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
Well, in Antigua cricket's the black man's game. The kids play it from the age of two. My daddy had me throwing googlies from the age of five. Then we moved to Tottenham and it was something different.
Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man.
But you fellas never get a break, do you?
See if she's all right.
I don't know her.
A story.
Like the one about the frog?
Stop that talk now --
What you say, faster?
Used to run the mile, you know -- four times round the cricket pitch -- what was that game called?
It was fun while it lasted.
Why do you think I brought you here?
Aren't you allowed to kiss back?
If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?
I think we were wrong about Tex having the money.
Reggie -- I think I've found --  are you on?
Can you remember anything at all?
Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
Now what?
But Charles' appointment was last week, not --
Tex? You mean he's here, too?
Reggie -- stop!
But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
You mean spies and things like that?
Very sweet.
Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
Why not?
What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really.
I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
Gratine, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again.
I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?
I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
Starting with his own.
No.
What now?
Do I knock or something?
I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
We'd better exchange keys. Here's mine.
Carson Dyle is dead.
Yes, he is. He was my brother.
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
Because he's wearing moccasins.
Whitefoot, of course.
Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me.
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
He's all yours. I'll do Tex and Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you -- and make sure you bolt the door from inside.
Maybe.
Hurry up and change -- I'm starved.
Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.
But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so?
Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
Have you ever, in your entire life, seen anything so beautiful?
I'm afraid it is important.
In money.
I'm -- I'm sorry.
What for? If it's not here, why bother him?
And if it is?
You think that mebbe we're fishin' the wrong stream?
What do you want?
Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
I don't know. I suppose so.
Is that all? Can I go now?
-- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay?
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
Oh, forgive me.  Is this yours?
It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
Sorry. Which view would you like?
Well, you're honest, anyway.
Now you're angry.
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
Where did everything go?
Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
What was all that?
I don't think I follow you.
Look, I know it's asking you to stretch your imagination, but can't you pretend for a moment that I'm a woman and that you're a --
Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute.
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
Miz Lampert, ma'am...
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
With a rich husband and this year's clothes you will not find it difficult to make some new friends.
I'm glad. But what's all this?
What's the matter, chrie?
Yeah? What's that?
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
Yeah?
I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
What I don't understand is why they asked Marliston if Rod was a virgin. They could have asked you Cindy.
One more time.
I get the imports.
If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today.
Hi honey.
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
Ok.
No?
Well?
Hello?
You know where I can find her?
She was murdered?
I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.
What?
I am.
of COURSE. You're not scared?
Who?
Mark Shale.
Why?
Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.
I don't know what I'm so scared of.
You ok?
I won't.
Stag?
No.
Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
Did Sharon say no?
If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it.
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
Mom?
I need to ask you something.
No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.
Years ago, something horrible happened in this town. When I was still in high school. A girl named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors.
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?
They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
Mr. Sisler was one of them.
Yes?
There's Jan and Heather. Let's grab them quick before someone else does.
Let me just ask you a serious question first.
Oh...
Great. 
...Darlene pay you in cash?
...two things Andy is not.  Uh, but I tell you what.
...think he was a wacko.  And I think that G.I. ninja's a bigger wacko.  And I think you're the biggest wack-...
...-er.
Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.
What the hell is with you, dog?  He's the one with the damn gun.
...-ed.
Billings?  No, no, no, no, no.  We need to go to McGruder.
No, no, no, no, no.  We gotta go to McGruder!  I go where the truck goes!
Yeah, borrowed!
I did not steal this truck!
...the ice cream for money!

 
Get him to stand up, Night Shift.
...gun?!
...you.
I did not steal the truck.
...truck!


I don't think we have much of a choice...
 Okay.
God, man!
Come on.
Whoo!

Hang on!
 Go on.
All right, let's go.


You're not dangerous!  You're crazy!  I ain't gettin' in this damn thing!
Then stay...

Uh-oh.
This river's fed by a glacier.  Willing to bet my life that it's a good deal under fifty degrees.
...did you?
It won't even start half the time.
Ow!  

Hey, just shut up.
Arlo, shut up.
Put your hand in my pants.
Yeah.
Okay. 
 All right.  Okay.
Arlo!
Come here.
...tunnel!
 
Hold this. 

Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.
Look out.

You know, we saved half a million people from a full-body peel.
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
Us.  Owes us.
I was not in the man's face.  I was nego-...
But he didn't.  See, that's negotiation.
To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.
I got three thousand dollars of highly perishable ice cream products that taste bad enough when it's...

...such is the price...of patriotism.
I had no idea how powerful it was.

Colonel Vitelli.  We got a busted-in cold vault inside.
Doc-...
What the hell is all this about a detonation today?  We're scheduled...
Sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation?
...-lar.
...sittin' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar!  And let me tell you something else.  I didn't join the service to let people like you turn...
...me?  Well, you could've saved yourself the trip.
...I began trying to find ways of controlling the effects of the weapon that we tested on Horn Island.
So far, ye-yes.

...Destry, Fair Oaks....
...here!
All right.  Let's clear the mess and move out.
And so Missoula's prodigal son returns.
Of which we have more than enough.
Hit him again.
This was supposed to be a...
Just when we have all the cards, Vaughn.  Take these two behind the van.
Get 'em in the  middle of the dam.
Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--
...scientists.
You don't think it's that bad, do you, sir?  I mean, Long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant.  The stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet.
Iced coffee.
...dangerous.
...though.
...to die for a country that's...
Because if you don't give me that cylinder, your lives will end...

Yeah?
Ah.
Is Elvis out?
...son.
Uh-huh.
A man named Tim Ma-...
Morning, doc.  Awful early, aren't ya?

Mason.
 ...or it'll ignite. 
And what if it does?
Mr. Sweeney, how goes it?
Mason, what is the temperature of Elvis?!
Forty-seven.
...uh, drifting around like the trash you are, or were you here workin'?
...-lem?
...public drunkenness....
...any idea what's goin' on here?!
 Wait.  Listen to me, Pappas.  If you don't let us by...
All right, go.

I'll stay here and secure this position.
Negative.  Negative.
I'll settle for L.A. County.
That's right.
Tell me. What do the police say?
None.
That's too bad.
It disturbs me, Mr. Gittes. It makes me think you're taking my daughter for a ride. Financially speaking, of course. How much are you charging her?
My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come up with any results.
What for?
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
No. She's probably scared to death.
Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
I'd like you to look at something, Mr. Cross.
That's all taken care of. You see, Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.
How do you do that?
The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
You've got her? Where?
What are you talking about?
You're absolutely right, I wouldn't give her another thought.
Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.
...No...
Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
Sure thing.
I'll just tell my wife.
I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred.
Plus what I owe you?
You sure this is okay?
Why?
I'm not.
Who?
No. It was an accident.
Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
Yeah, I took 'em. So what?
What are you talking about?
I know what he says.
Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
...Well, it didn't make him happy...
A complete surprise?
What are you having?
What do you mean?
You left your keys in the ignition.
I got your check in the mall.
You'll have to explain that, Mrs. Mulwray.
No, not for that one.
Then it was over the water department.
The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.
No.
Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
The Albacore Club.
I saw him.
You may think you know what's going on, but you don't.
She's too upset.
I can't...
I took your husband's Buick...  I'll return it tomorrow.
J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar
What did you do that for?
What are you saying?
Katherine?... Katherine who?
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
When did you come in?
Yeah, Sophie.
Who?
Naturally, I want the best for him, money is no object.
Just to be certain, I wonder if you could show us a list of your patients?
Oh, good.
After all, you work with a man for a certain length of time, you come to know him, his habits, his values, and so forth. Well either he's the kind who chases after women or he isn't.
Mind if I take one of your cards? In case I want to get in touch with you again.
Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.  Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?
Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation.  I don't know what you're talking about.
Hard working, have a wife and kids...
What about the water?
Sure you do.
City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
May I ask what this is regarding?
Along with Mr. Mulwray.
Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray's real phone number and address.
Yeah?
Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives.
We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that.
Course, she settled down nicely.
You don't say?
But don't you like anything about what you do? 
It's got to be sent to another town. And if we don't the owner of that movie house gets pissed off.
Yes. I want proof.
I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story.  Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end I'll be yours.' Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day, two days, ten, twenty...Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. He didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch...And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
Toto, are you pulling my leg or something? How is it possible to see this television without film?
Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him... 
You understand now? You see it clearly?
But...who...
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
But I've never forgotten you, Elena!
Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
I don't remember him any moreMa, where's Russia?
Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher -
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
My Declaration of Principles -  Don't smile, Brad -  Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -
Say, with them fellows -  - it's no trick to get circulation.
Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"!  This has, I think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists -  Mr. Reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks. It will make them happy to learn that the "Enquirer's" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark.
So then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh?  Especially the new papers -
It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  Wonderful. Wonderful.
Please, Mr. Bernstein.
Go in and ask him to hurry.
Yes.  I thought it was a good idea. We've covered it from the news end, of course.
Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with Mr. Kane from the very beginning -
Who else did you see?
Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -
He made an awful lot of money.
He finished it.  He wrote the worst notice I ever read about the girl he loved.  We ran it in every paper.
I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so well of Susie's art anyway.
Do you, Mr. Leland?
Isn't it wonderful?  Such a party!
What's the matter?
Certainly not.  So what's that got to do with it?  Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.
Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the "Enquirer." I am Herbert Carter.
I'm going to live right here.  As long as I have to.
But, Mr. Kane -
How do you do?  I came here - and I made Mr. Kane come with me...  because I recieved this note -
Let him finish, Charles.
Almost two to one -
What do you expect me to do?  What in the world -
There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
You don't think I'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me, do you?
Charlie, please don't -
What's the matter with you?
Oh!
I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
Where's the towel?
No.  But you're close.
You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and - 
Who am I?  Well, let's see.  Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six -  I run a couple of newspapers.  How about you?
I work at Seligman's.
Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
At night?
You always said you wanted to live in a palace.
I'm not sorry.
"Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast."  You know you haven't the slightest proof that this - this armada - is off the Jersey Coast.
You see!  There hasn't been a true word -
I've changed the front page a little, Mr. Bernstein.  That's not enough - There's something I've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print -  I've got to make the "New York Enquirer" as important to New York as the gas in that light.
Yes?
I mean I've got a job for you.
Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the "Enquirer" in his pocket?
- and that copy of the "Enquirer" said the President should be killed.
First of all - 
You talk about the people of the United States as though they belonged to you.  When you find out they don't think they are, you'll lose interest.  You talk about giving them their rights as though you could make a present of liberty. Remember the working man?  You used to defend him quite a good deal. Well, he's turning into something called organized labor and you don't like that at all.  And listen, when your precious underprivileged really get together - that's going to add up to something bigger than - than your privilege and then I don't know what you'll do - sail away to a desert island, probably, and lord it over the monkeys.
Are you finished?
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. 
Mr. Leland, you were -
You don't happen to have a cigar, do you?  I've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one - who thinks I'm going to stop smoking...  I changed the subject, didn't I?  Dear, dear!  What a disagreeable old man I've become.  You want to know what I think of Charlie Kane?  Well - I suppose he has some private sort of greatness. But he kept it to himself.  He never - gave himself away -  He never gave anything away.  He just - left you a tip.  He had a generous mind.  I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions.  That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it -  But he didn't believe in anything except Charlie Kane.  He never had a conviction in his life.  I guess he died without one -  That must have been pretty unpleasant.  Of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death.  But we do know what we're leaving ... we believe in something.  You're absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?
Brief marriage!  Ten years! 
That must have been love.
Sure.
I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
Millions - if anybody wants it.
The banks are out of luck, eh?
What about that apartment?
It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead.  Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
Hey, now wait a sec...
I think you'd better leave now.
Yeah, but not in here.
You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in.
Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?
Exactly.
God, isn't he great?
There's no light back there.
Am I missing something here?
I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.
It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know?  And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.
Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
No.
How like her.
But you were.
Sang? His name is a past tense?
Jesus, you're caustic.
I would like to be your boyfriend, yes.
Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...
Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
He's your fianc.
So what are you saying?
Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.
Who doesn't?
What happened to the walk and the nakedness?
I'm serious.
Wait a second? Who was working here today?
Nobody. It was closed.
This is the last time I come to this place.
That's easy to say from over here.
All right, now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight, then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent.
So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
Shit!
What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
Someone jammed gum in the locks.
Shocking abuse of authority.
I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
What do you mean?
Return of the Jedi.
Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.
What's that?
The Emperor.
Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?
What's he looking for?
How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.
I know.
I don't back down.
Are you gonna lock the store?
Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?
Helluva game!
Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
How? When?
But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
If you go, I go.
You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!
Why should I loan you my car?
I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.
I didn't think they even enforced this.
Little girl. Maybe five years old?
Holy shit. That girl?
As opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here.
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
You're happy to get a fine?
Who eats cock?
Bunch of savages in this town.  Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.
She said she did all the work.
This life?
You should shit or get off the pot.
Leave me alone.
I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.
If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...
Lovely story.
I thought I was doing you a favor.
I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica.
All right. Good luck with Veronica. If you want, I can talk to her, you know, and explain...
Helluva day.
Do you need a hug or something? 'Cause I would have no hang-ups about hugging you... you know, you being a guy and all. Just don't knead my ass when you do it.
Do I know you?
I still remember Caitlin telling us about that time you two went to that motel-the one with the mirrors and the hot tub in the room.
Yeah.
All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.
Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?
He died in the bathroom.
Don't you already have a girlfriend?
Veronica.
Be careful.
You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer.
At least they weren't lit.
I hate this fucking place.
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
Don't you have a hockey game at two?
Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep!
What? What is that?
"Be there?"
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough.
I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.
How many girls have you slept with?
Why'd you hit me?
John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
Like you said-she snowballed him.
How many dicks have you sucked?!
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
Well... why did you have to suck their dicks? Why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?!
Really?  You're the best.
The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
...it isn't there. Yes.
Thank you for being rational.
What the fuck did you do that for?
It was only a few times...
Would you let me explain...
Veronica, I love you...
Yes.  I'm not out of shape.
Check this out, he's from Russia.
Does he sing in English or Russian?
Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
I hope it feels good.
How long you gonna be here?
The only place I don't bring my drugs is church. And that ain't till Sunday morning.
I know. I've been here since eleven.
Do you still talk to Sylvan?
Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
Surprise me.
A monkey?
That was the first and last question-- now only answers. Where's the chopper?
You do, and the spring thaw is going to be worth a lot of cash!
Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
Can I count as fast as I like?
That's it, you look like a professional.
Oh, my God!  I can't recognize the face, but the butt does look vaguely familiar. 
Enough.
Working...I'm trying to figure out where to start.
I can't blame anything on Hal. It was me.  I play it back in my mind everyday.
You couldn't.
And I can't leave.
I can't.  The radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper.
Remember the first time we came up here?
Take the rope.
I burned it.
You and Frank get the tents, thermal clothing, and medical supplies together.
Who's going with you?
Oh, my God!
Don't use my name!
What about it?
Is it set?
I'd like to have a word with you. This is Agent Matheson, FBI.
He are here! He have arrived! Hooray!
Come on, Alex. Come for walkies. Hahahahaha.
It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir.
I'm so pleased you appreciate good wine. Have another glass!
Phoned some friends, sir?
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
What would you like to know, sir?
I've got to rest, Mum... got to get fit, otherwise I'm liable to miss a lot more school.
Why didn't you let us know what was happening, son?
A rather intolerable pain in the head, brother, sir. I think it should be clear by this afterlunch.
No time, no time, yes. Sit, sit, sit. Alex sits next to him.
A big black mark I tell you for every one we don't reclaim. A confession of failure for every one of you who ends up in the stripy hole.
You are now a murderer, little Alex. A murderer, yes.
The newspapers mentioned that in addition to your being conditioned against acts of sex and violence, you've inadvertently been conditioned against music.
Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.
When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?
Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much down in spirits.
Um... well, put it this way... I feel very low in myself. I can't see much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me. He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti.
All right, no more picking on Dim, brother. That's part of the new way.
Who said that?
Not feeling too bad now are you?
Hullo lad. What a surprise, good to see you.
What gives, O my Pee and Em, what makes you think you are welcome? Em sobs. Pee comforts her.
You wanna be sick?
Crime?
No, sir.
Do you wear any false teeth or false limbs?
No, sir.
I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.
Yes!!!
No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
Well, when I was all like ashamed up and half awake and unconscious like, I kept having this dream like all these doctors were playing around with me gulliver. You know... like the inside of me brain. I seemed to have this dream over and over again. D'you think it means anything?
Right... Knickers... Cabbages... It doesn't have a beak. Alex laughs. Slide of woman speaking to boy.
That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
Good. What do you want?
Good. You can do whatever you like with these.
Eggiwegs. I would like to smash 'em. Pick up th elot and f... owww... He slams his hand down and cries out with pain.
It's not that kind of a test. But you seem well on the way to a complete recovery.
What's all this about sin?
You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform.
Father - may I ask you a question in private?
No Father. It's nothing like that, Father. It's about this new thing they're all talking about. About this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again.
It has not been used yet in this prison. The Governor has grave doubts about it and I have heard that there are very serious dangers involved.
Be patient, my son, and put your trust in the Lord.
One shirt - blue, collar attached.
Carry on, Chief.
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
Pitiful rookerful...
We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
I'll take Sixth.  It's faster.
The ride is free.
I used to play this piece back in high school.
Why'd you do that?  Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
Most of the time.
You still carrying passengers?
...I was just a young cat back then, about nineteen, bussin' tables in this very place.  Didn't pay but shit, but that wasn't the point.  Being around the music, that was the thing.  And I was.  Take this one night...July 22, 1964...who walks in?  Mr. Louis Armstrong.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
I know the answer.  I know all there is to know about Louis.
Tell me, Vincent.  Do you believe in Santa Claus?
I picked up a tail.
Oh, right.  The guy flipped out or something?  Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?
...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue.  The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.
I'm sure you're very proud of Max.
What's your name?
You're kidding me.
It's not that kind of job.
Like what?
Twenty-four minutes!  Man, you're hot...
I'm not a hire car.  It's against regs?
Max.
Try harder.  I'm gonna count to three. One...
The thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor...
You better?
Tonight it is.
Rwanda-Burundi.  Central Africa.
Please.  Don't do anything.
I'll talk to them, I'll talk to them.
Lenny?  You're an asshole.
I'm...what?  Sorry?
I'm not catching a melody.
You're the one who keeps talking about going with the flow.  You like the man, you like the way he plays.  How about a little jazz, huh?
What you mean, no?
I've always been good.  Ever since I started.  Gave up piano.  Easy money. I'm putting a stake together, get something started.  Go figure it all out...
Yeah?  Like what?  Limos?
Doesn't cover everything.
When he finds out you tossed his list? I would.
Vincent.  Don't make me do this. Don't make me get people killed.
I don't know.
I shoulda saved him 'cause he <u>believed</u> you?
Some living.
Whyn't you kill me and find another cab.
What happened to you?
Slow down.
Well.  That was brilliant.
Love?  Love's just a pretty way of saying, 'I want to sleep with you'.  Love is bullshit.
Are you crazy?!
I was only going one way.
What're you thinking, Jerry?
<u>Jerry</u>?  You didn't show last night.  First time ever.  Had me worried, boy.
I can't promise you anything.
You bit someone's nose off?
People do have heart attacks.
You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?
If my universe had a hub...
I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?
He's why you punish yourself.
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.
His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
Right here in Manhattan.
Yeah...  Would you, I mean, could you love me then?  If I was normal.  Maybe?
How come serial killers have two names, but lone gunman assassins have three.  John <u>Wilkes</u> Booth. Mark <u>David</u> Chapman.  Lee <u>Harvey</u> Oswald.
I don't understand.
Yeah.  I know what it's like.
I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad.  I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
Why?  What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
They changed Franklin's portrait.
That's great.  Good for you.
Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
What's that?
You made your decision yet?
That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.
We experimented with hallucinogens.  We used electro- shock to produce a vegetative state.  We conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation.
<u>My dog</u>.  One I intend to put to sleep.  Extrapolate from there.
Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed --
Hmm, how about tomorrow night?
I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.
This doesn't make sense.
That's the book Hinkley had on him when he shot Reagan.
You're welcome!  Spooks.  So, you want to compare notes on this guy.
Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
Glad to have you, David.  How's the new office?
Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
Pepsi?  Tequila?
Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --
You can't just pull the plug, David.
... Arrangements also have to be made for the V.I.P.s coming in, mostly religious leaders...
We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
You mean --
David --
I don't understand.
You...
You aren't staying?
What would you have me say, David?
Mr. Rank's organization represents the point of view of tens of millions of families, Dr. Arroway. Feel free to disagree, but there won't be any suppressing of opinions here today.
Hydrogen times pi...  Got it.  Strong sucker.
But you're so... I mean how could you possibly...?  When I was unconscious.  You... downloaded... my thoughts, my memories, even...  This beach.  I've never been here but I remember... it's how I always imagined...  Pensacola.
Not all.  Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams.  Some never make it this far.
No!  I mean... why so soon?
What kind of deal?
Not if you think like a Vegan.
Mr. Hadden, I'm a scientist; I don't make deals... But.  If you wish to give me, in good faith, access to your information, I can assure you that I will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesn't conflict with the best interests of science... or my better judgment.
Ellie.  Arroway.
It's almost there.  The hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time.
We could be together again --
I'm going on staff at the N.S.F.  To work for Drumlin.
'The work,' Jesus, Ellie, can't there just once be more to life than the work?  Okay, maybe that's the only way to get the recognition, win the prizes --
Right now -- we'll drive down to Ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us.
Ellie --
I'm serious about this, Peter --
Ellie -- I'm getting married.  Her name's Laura.  She came up to Owens Valley to do her post-doc about six months after you left.
Ellie.
It's really happening.
That you, Valerian?
Wait -- hold on a minute --
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
What day?
I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
Yes.  Very much.
I don't think so.
It's getting late...
Ellie --
Ellie... the last time we spoke... I said some things...
Please --
Hi.
It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.
You have a question, Dr. Arroway?
I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
Helen, she sent along your things with a note, and John here, he wrote to the police.
Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on 'em.
What went wrong?
She took off with that convertible feller...
Lookit her bounce.
Tell us about it.
We saw the broads.
What's all this dirt in the yard?
Here's the Patrol.
Here, Captain.
Hey, Tattoo!
You can't do that!
Oh, man, did you see her? Did you see her?
But there's still daylight left.
Jus' take it slow, buddy.
Well, whatta we got here?
They don't know iff'n to smile, spit or swallow.
You don't understand a thing, do you, Drag?
Luke, you got to listen to me. All you got to do is just give up nice and quiet, just play it cool.
Not a liar. You just have a common -- and likable -- tendency toward exaggeration.
Koko, write down their names, don't just make marks.
Thirty-nine... forty... forty-one... forty-two...
That fool. That damn fool.
Man, you play like a kokonut. You got to call him at least.
Oh no, man! Not on this hot muther.
Yeah, found one in this supermarket, keys in the ignition.
But -- but --
You threatened to drive her downtown.  She has agoraphobia.
Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for.  <u>Forget</u> it.
You're fired.
Sorry, Luv.  I've got a date.
You bastard!
We'll get the paramedics...
The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects.
I thought he was lying.
He told me he had done two others just like it.
I was?  How you spell that?
You don't listen very good.  This break in -- I can call it a felony -- three strikes, and you got about sixteen strikes already, and you're in jail for the rest of your life, no parole.  Or I could see it gets forgotten.
You were going to make a delivery to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee Cullum.  I want Kurten's phone number.
The door was open, swear to God, I'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs...
You come and visit.
For God's sake Peter, leave her out of it.  You don't want her, you want me.
I have no life anymore.  I ruined your life, make me pay for it.
No, ma'am.  This is no joke.  And neither is tying up telephone lines to police with crank calls while people in trouble are trying to get through for help.
You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.
Would you want to work with us on this?
Is it an ongoing case?
Can you make a copy we can show on our computers?
One officer already got killed trying to protect me.  Please, just take it all away.  Leave me alone.
Maybe that's why you can't catch him.  I <u>know</u> what she looks like -- the red-headed woman in my computer.
That's amazing.  A whole new book, thought up in a minute.  Very good.  All I know how t do is get up, take a shower, and go to work. Hope, if he does another I'll nail the son of bitch, and they'll spell my name right in the newspaper. Where is Andy going?
Then what do you need me for?
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping."  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it.
Have you got a warrant?  Get the hell out o here!  This is the <u>only space I have left in the</u> <u>world</u>!  Why can't you leave me out of it?
Injected Windex!  Why would he switch to a new m.o.?
Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his work...
It's also the major piece of evidence, and it makes you a key part of his plan.  You can't run away from it anymore.  Look at the order he's doing them... He did three as the Boston Strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work.  Then he did one like the Hillside Strang- ler.  And then one as Son of Sam. To lead us on -- to where and what end?  And he's doing more than that -- he's imitating each killer's method as closely as he can -- in details.  Injecting Windex.  Using .44.  Playing Abba.
I'm working on it!  It's what I do.  Quinn...Halloran.  I'll wait.  Where's Andy, can we get some coffee in here?
I am not going to talk about it. How do you <u>know</u> it was Andy if the head was gone?  Where is the head? Are you looking for it?  Oh, God, why him?  Because of me.  I can't talk about it.  I write about things like this, stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries. This is the first person close to me who's ever died.  And it's because of me.  This monster killed him because I loved him.
Yes.  I have to go...
Don't hang up!
<u>What</u>?...
He was in my apartment!
You know how to use this?
Because it's your job, that's all.
He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  We heard from Doctor Hudson?
Get the pictures, and casts of footprints.
She wants me to check the phone booth for a note.
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.
How about I put Nikko on it?
Yessir.
Teach both of them a lesson in cooperation and self-discipline.
I just got here myself, Susan.
Have you seen it?
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
You should have gone to the funeral.
It does.
I thought that was you, up there.
The airport? Why? Are you leaving?
The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage.
I saw the blood. It looks like motor oil.
It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that... that is my project.
He must have driven through a pool of blood. If the police stop you again, they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed. Vaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood.
The medicine's still bothering me. It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.
I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
So, we'll meet every Tuesday and Friday. And if you have any kind of emergency, you can page me.
Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
How can I help?
Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes.
But what am I going to do?
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
Has Paul heard about his promotion?
No.
Really?    Me too.
Why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors? That's no way for us to break up.
Then it's over.
I do.
Michael, I...
Tell me all.
You've got to see the kitchen first.
Gosh, Letty, this is a great place.
Promise?
Four interviews. Four no-gos.
Why'd you tell?
Silly, silly, silly.
I've been thinking I could try to visit you at night after work, and then there'd be more time on weekends to see...
I'm sorry.     I didn't come here to blame you.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
What are we going to do?
I love you so much.
Can I put these here for tonight?
Believe me, I know your feelings on the matter.
I don't think so.
I'm going to the store.
Especially now.
I heard about your friend.
Look, I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI.
Hello?
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
I will relay the particulars of our conversation to Mr. Maranzano.
He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it?
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
I only have your word for that.
Thank you.
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
Get that, will you?
Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
We had a chance to walk out of Zammito's house.
What's the big deal? It's not like I was on guard duty or something.
All right, knock it off.
What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
Does it really matter what I say?
Did you have to use that much explosive?
Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
There's ten grand in here. It's yours. I'm going to call you again. There's one more thing I need you to do.
Okay, we're square now, right?
You said don't do it, boss.
Hey boss, it's not a science.
French guys?    You mean like from France?
What hotel?
What about transportation?
They don't serve wine here.
We've got to get out of here.
Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't trust anyone these days.
-- I want to be Elvis.
You guys used to work together?
This is great. After everything we've been through we've got eight hundred euros and an autographed baseball.
What happened?
How?
No problem, man.  Hey, you wanna hit?
You ever hear of jet lag?
Did she break your heart?
Something like that.
Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.
It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
Who are you waiting for?
You're back!
In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance.
Don't bother.
My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
You're too young to understand.
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
I've missed you.
You're doing calligraphy?
You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.
Do you think so?  Let me tell you a story.
Here you must be in proper attire.
Go back to them first.  Then you can decide about Lo.
You know about Lo?
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
Not another lecture!  On guard!
Let's end this here.
When I was a boy, one night, I saw a thousand shooting stars.  I thought, where did they all go? I'm an orphan.  I used to look for stars alone.  I thought if I rode to the other end of the desert, I'd find them.  I've been riding in the desert ever since.
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's. On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's.  Were you involved?
I knew she would intrigue you.
She needs direction... and training.
I thought by giving away the sword, I could escape the Giang Hu world. But the cycle of bloodshed continues.
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.
A murderer?
This is Li's personal sword, a great hero's weapon!  He is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it.  It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it.
You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me.  Please accept our thanks.
No onions though, okay?
Well, hello there...chocolate,
It's only a flesh wound.
You're welcome.
Don't interfere.
I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
You brought flowers.  As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives.
A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.
You cut her.  You raped her.  You watched!
I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
Another jolly nickname?
T-Bird?
And how many lives have you destroyed?
Glad to see you're finally with the program.
Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?
Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.  The blood will not return.  No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.
18k.  Crap.
What's this -- a little, ah, bloodstain, right?  Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm doin' you a --
Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
That's right.
Are you okay?
Excuse me?
No. I mean. I don't know.  What else do you know about him?
Forever.
So what year are you going into?
Junior.
Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.
I never said that.
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
And you promise to abide by it?
Without question.
What?
I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?
What are you reading?
Okay.
I don't.
You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady.
No.
I thought you said we were going to be friends.
Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
Please don't go.
Would you like a tour?
You don't know how to love.
- wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me.
The football stud?
Don't think it's not going to cost you.
What are the boys like?
Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.
He's alright.  He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.
Really? Bulimic headcase.
Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
Okay.
You'd do that for me?
What do you mean?!
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
It's like a secret society.
Excellent.
Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom and have her come pick you up.
Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom.
Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
My daughter, Rachel.
Hi, mom.
Did you do everything I asked you to?
You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded?
It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
Racist piece of shit.
He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.
Sorry.
Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way.
Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.
I'm working on it.
You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
Moving along quite well.
Have you succeeded in your task?
Any day now.
Before we go through with this, I just want you to be aware of the damage we're going to cause.
Shut up.
So? How'd it go last night?
She shot you down.
You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.
Where'd she go?
Bad time?
I want to fuck.
No, I'm not.
I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're in love with her. You don't love me anymore.
Why so nervous?
Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you.
I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
Ronald? That's crazy.
Uh huh. You beat me three times.
Ronald, e-mail's for geeks and pedophiles. Be romantic. Write her another letter.
Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?
I love the smell of pine.
But Edward, in this kind of a wish that doesn't matter.
Yes, darling.
Sometimes.
Someone gave it to you? Where was this old house?
Do you know the people?
Oh, thank you, darling.
You make me sound like the father in "East Lynne."
I haven't had my breakfast.
Where did you get it?
What's funny?
I thought you were with Amy.
Amy, not that old tree!
Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories  I'm sick of this sort of thing.
Just you wait!
Yes, she was afraid. She said there was someone who wanted to kill me.
But there's no one here, darling.
Irena. But who are you?
I can not tell you.
Can't you get it, darling?
But we don't have any sea weed.
Your children?
All right, Amy.  Button your sweater, darling. It's turning cold.
So beautiful, Irena. So beautiful.
Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
It's a pretty ring.
Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did.
But what happened to the little deer?
Mommy read it to ne.
He'll let me stay, Mrs. Farren. He'll let me stay.
You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter.
I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.
...At the hour of midnight, down the road that goes through Sleepy Hollow, across the bridge, he goes galloping, galloping, always searching, always seeking
There's a present you haven't opened yet, ma'am.
Amy looks happy  seems almost as if she were playing with another child; like somebody else were running with her and playing.
She refuses to deny it. She continues to believe in her lies.
But we have. She's wanted for nothing.
I'm lucky Jen's not like that.
Jennifer gave her a make-over.
Sorry I didn't recognize you earlier. You look so different.
I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
I mean where on your body?
And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.
Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?
Your shrink always gives you bad advice. He only hears what you choose to tell him. Mark's an asshole, he cheated, he borrowed money and never paid it back, he's never had a regular job.
He's a very talented musician.
Frida, I don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about PMS around men.
Or if there's a full moon.
And she got the medium.
I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?
So did you do it?
I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.
Give him the tampon test.
What the hell is the tampon test?
It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
Hello?
Shit, I guess I missed work.
Oh no.
First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
Peter keeps asking me out.
This is from a scientist in France, Madame Sconce. "The original werewolves were females. They became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the woman's cycle. My suspicion is that the only cure is true love."
God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower.
I'm really tired.
You should have gone at the restaurant.
Knock what off?
You don't have to pee.
Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
Frida? I hear you talking. I know you're in there. Let me in.
It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
I gotta get going. Peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag.
Being a cop has such a warm effect on people.
Used to? Did it stop finally?
I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something.
Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
Yeah. Maybe.
I'm a cop -- I notice everything. That drawer's ajar, that picture's been moved about an inch, the closet wasn't closed when I left...
Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.
You didn't say it.
What's with the squirt guns?
They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
They do? Oh no...
You at least owe me the truth.
If you don't like me, just say so. You don't have to make up some bullshit like you're a werewolf.
I don't think you would. No matter what form you take.
See he was cheating from the get go.
I told you she was innocent.
What?
He was found nearly ripped to shreds in Central Park.
I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.
What makes her think that?
Looks like you need a haircut to me.
Sell maps?
He tried to kill me!
To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've run into each other like this.  Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.
That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
In there.
Its extremely important to my investigation...
Lost something?
Ive taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompsons office searched, as I believe you instructed.  All clear now, sir.  They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man.
Good.
Why, yes.
I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
But...  How long has this been happening?
But I...
You know something about me?
Bad dreams?
Yes.
I'm nothing then.
Can I get my life back?
What happened to you?
What?
First Lady...
Be a professional. If you can convince her - - you can convince anybody.
Alan
I'm... not... nobody...
She's a little hysterical right now. We've got her upstairs in a laundry room.
Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
Don't call the Vice President!
... What?
Bob...
I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up.  Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months.  The whole thing is under control.
I'm going to kill him.
I was gonna do something with Joan.
I'm not sure.
Right.  Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
Let's call it a night.   I can't take any more.
What do you mean you made it all up?
Oh... Thanks.
They re not my attack dogs.
Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.
You mean with you and everything?
Didn't mean to bum you out.
Thanks for doing this, Ellen.
That's not just a works bill you vetoed -- that would have given these kids homes...  ... When I think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick...
They asked me to help.
You're leaving?
In fact,  I'm not anything like him and... I guess I want you to know that.
You have a lot of secrets.
Well I guess...
What's wrong?
So this is it?
Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
I know it hurts. But it won't be long. Then all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO HEAR ME SO SHE KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER TO HURT SO!
Sir. It's quite clear that...
Thanks. I can fight my own battles.
The man I was with...until today... believed that praying was for blind men who couldn't see the truth.
Curse?
Datura.
We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will...
God....damn you, Rhodes!
Oh, I have no doubt.
I want you to leave. Then maybe...
I'll have somebody's ass for this. I'll have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand here and...
My..."detail", sir. We're going to bury the heads.
No relation.  Never heard of him. Sorry.
So what the hell's Mutt been up to?
Don't come.
I don't think they're in school.
Women swoon!
The millions are awake enough for Physical labor; but only one in a million is awake enough for effective intellectual exertion, only one in a hundred millions to a poetic or divine life.  To be awake is to be alive.
I feel like I've never been alive.  For years I've been risking nothing.  I have no idea what I am or what I want to do! Neil, you know you want to act.  Knox wants Chris.
God, I can't take it anymore!  If I don't have Chris, I'll kill myself.
He flatters me so I'll help him with Latin.
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
I told you, that's a secret.
Yeah!    Don't you guys miss having girls here?
That's right, it's Nuwanda.
I think he's sweet.
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.  You're not like that.
Doing fine, sir.
No one, sir.  It was just me.  I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane's.
Well, Meeks aced Latin and I didn't quite flunk English so if you want, we've got our study group.
I went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately."  I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life!"
Where'd you find them?
What good will that do?
Chris.  We got it.  Let's go.
Pleased to meet you.
Hello?
Chris!
If they catch you here, we'll both be in big trouble.
The hoi polloi.  Doesn't it mean the herd?
A yawp?
A madman.
I know what he'll say.  He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it.  He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good."
What did your father say? Did you talk to him?
Damn.  Damn!  If I could just get Chris to read this poem!
All right!  What'd she say?
I will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?
Father!
Don't you dare talk back to me!  It's bad enough that you've wasted your time with this absurd acting business.  But you deliberately deceived me!  Who put this in your head? How did you expect to get away with it? Answer me!
Father, I have the main part.  The performance is tomorrow night.  Father, please.
I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  Is that clear?  Is that clear!
Weird.
I say we go tonight.  Everybody in?
What?
Want to come to the study group?
I don't want to read.
A play, dummy.
And now he will?
No!  I don't know,  I'll probably never know.  The point is, there's nothing you can do about it so butt out, all right? I can take care of myself just fine.  All right?
Here, villain, draw and ready. where art thou?
You the Captain?
Who?
The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
Speedboat in the middle of the ocean...
Great woman your mother. Real foresight.
What are you people talking about?
I was born in a City housing project in the Bronx OK? It's not in the cards that I die on a luxury cruise ship...now which way up?
You people...rich people...
So this boat of yours...that's what you do? Give people...rides.
Self sufficient...
Looking good...
Oh my god! Oh my god! How do we do it? How do we get there?
If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?
Finnegan, what the hell was that?
Joey... Which way's aft?
Can somebody tell me what the object of the exercise is here?
You know what my goal is? Before I die I want to make love to a woman from every country on earth.
What the hell does that mean?
Why don't you help us so we can get done faster so we can get the hell out of here?
Don't shoot, man, don't shoot!
You want 'em?
Damn right!
Damn right!
I'm telling you, they changed it!
She does not!
In case!!! The gun's in case!!!
I got delayed. I --
Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.
Did you ever think life would turn out like this?
I have to go.
But of course! Please make yourself comfortable. Perhaps you would enjoy some fresh caviar, or une petite glace, or --?
I came to see Merle.
I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much!
Linda, yeah.
Oh. Fine.
You know a guy named Merle?
Merle? That's who we're looking for. Merle.
Yeah?
Oh, well...
Get 'em! For Christ sake, get 'em!
'Course how could you miss, right? Twenty, maybe thirty feet. I mean, if I'd'a been where you guys were --
Listen, Biederman, I'm going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so important.
What?
Sure.
Frost.
Naw, it's... I mean...
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
I'm just so lonely.
Mais certainment... A great deal of money. Naturally I do not do it myself. I myself do not possess the nerve.  But I am always... how do you say... looking out for those who do... It is a thing quite rare. Champagne perhaps? Tch, tch. Don't say no. When a man says no to champagne, he says no to life and that no man must ever do.  Where did you play?
That way it sets.
You do?
Nick, he just came back.
Merle --
Huh?
I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
We gotta play with more bullets.
No. No way!
When you get the AK, open up. You got me? Open up.
You wanna bet?
Watch it, shithead!
Great. Hey. That's great.
No.
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
No.
He's getting married... and we're nuts!
How're you guys... I mean, how've you guys been?
Never one.
You're full of shit!
You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
Down I would say... What would you say?
Down.
This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
Kimberly!
Funny guy.
Looks like you did more than jackoff while I was gone.
You can't kill me.  I'm going to be Mayor tomorrow.
Remember my promise.
That's not your zone.  Stick to data entry.
You two fucks listen up.  Doucet's killing people and you're wasting valuable time busting two-bit Technothugs.
But sir, Sergeant Wade saved the hostages.
Nobody's looking.
Maybe I should put on the training whe---
You my partner?
Are you a cop?
Commissioner Gallagher gave me specific orders not to let you drive until you re-familiarize yourself with the process and territory.
Got it.  Ejection seat?
They're going to rob that bank.
I'll inform dispatch.
Hey, buddy...
Kid, you ever been in a high speed chase before?
Sanchez...?
You be careful.
I'm going to be a policeman.
William Simpson.  I like Willy.
Bye.  Thanks.
You could always take it off.
Jabez -- ?
'N Daniel Webster will be there.
I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
What's that, sir?
It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
Grandma, look at me!
Yes, I wanted to get here before the others.... I want to talk to you alone.
You are afraid!
Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think happens? We're buried -- that's all.
I do -- and I think you should too.
Of course. Why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county.  You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do. Hard work -- well, that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else. It's all right for people who aren't lucky -- but once you're lucky -- you don't work for other people. You make them work for you.
Oh, you know the old story -- the Hessian wagon train that was ambushed on the way to Saratoga. Some of the gold has been buried under your barn!
Not now! Not now!  -- Let me make up -- let me make up.
I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...
Ten throws -- Mr. Webster?
I don't seem to be so very popular after all -- in Cross Corners.
I'm sorry you can't see that, I know you could once -- you made a little speech once, that I'll always remember and I know the others do too --  They remember and they see how you have changed. That's why they didn't want to come tonight to you, Jabez -- you're as blind as a Burma bat, with your gold pot! Mind you, it's not the money, I've been talking about, it's what you make of it.
I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too.
Well, I --
Ahem -- we want to have a little confidential talk with you, Neighbor Stone. Don't like to take a man away from his planting -- but sometimes --
But -- I was just lucky.
That's fine. Now you can tell people all about the house, but don't mention Webster.
5000 -- that's just what I owe you.
Jabez -- help!
Who is it?
Oh Jabez! And we were counting on ...  It's a lovely calf.
Jabez ...
I'll get the doctor.
What do you think of that, Jabez?
We must go on home, Jabez.
Worried!
Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
Mary! I'm -- Selectman of Cross Corners!
No, no. I don't want to be idle.
Think this room is larger than anything Webster's got at Marshfield? You've been there. What about it, Mary?
It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all.
Yes -- I was getting the seed -- I stumbled -- I saw one of the boards warped up a bit -- and -- there it was.
Well -- that's comforting!  Supper.
Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma?
Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
Golly, Ma --  Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight.
Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
Let him try it.
So you've made up your mind to go to the party.
It's only a short drive, Mr. Webster.
Oh -- it's you again. What do you want?
It even kicked back -- once at you, didn't it?
There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy. 
And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England? 'Tis true, the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in the country than yours.
Your Honor -- gentlemen of the jury -- this case need not detain us long. It concerns one thing alone -- the transference, barter and sale of a certain piece of property, to wit, his soul by Jabez Stone. That transference, barter or sale is attested by a deed. I offer that deed in evidence and mark it Exhibit A.
My money? Why, Mister Stevens? What a quaint idea. Come over to the door. I want to speak to you privately. Stop throwing away that money. We mustn't let people see any softness in you, Mister Stevens.... People take advantage of softness, you know. Come out of there -- I'll give you an extension if you'll forget this stupid repentance idea.
Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?
So, you go on upstairs to the party, your lady sees you, you run into each other's arms.  Music comes up, you live happily ever after, that it?
They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them...or your husband.  Hi there.
Ellis, what have you told them?
What am I, a method actor?  Hans, babe, put away the gun.  This is radio, not television...
It's beautiful.  I always enjoyed models as a boy.  The exactness, the attention to every foreseeable detail... perfection.
You want...money?  What kind of terrorists are you?
The code key, please...?
You...you don't work for Nakatomi... and if you're not one of them...
Better than being caught with your pants down, right?  John McClane.
Bill, you know how to use a handgun?
Put it down now.
How long?
I...have a request.
It's a long story.  You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you.
My job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be.
Holly Gennero?
The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.
Hey, you couldn't know.
The terrorists?  Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
Then who the hell have you been talking too?
I don't think so, Sir.  In fact... I think he's a cop.  Maybe not LAPD, but definitely a badge.
What's going on?
So whatsa deal?
I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  Yellin' at me in front of all those people.  Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never.  I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river.
Heidi, for Christ sake, shut up! Will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?!
...because you hurt me, God how you hurt me.  Can you imagine, marrying another man?  Did I do something to make you do that?  Did I ever turn you down, or anything?  The only thing I couldn't do, you're gonna laugh, is go on top - I got this fear of high places!  And I let myself get fat.
Heidi - why didn't you come down here?
Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.
I'll kiss the baby for you.
I don't know what I'm doing.
Who the fuck knows?  I think we're gonna go ... we worked it out to Algeria.  So, I don't know.  So I'll go to Algeria.
I don't know... you could have picked a better place.
Denmark?  Sweden?
Oh... wow!  Sonny, you're really into one mess now.
All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
It's my only chance!
Oh, God, they shot me with like unreal!
Oh no!
I can't talk to him.
Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you.
What?
So, what were they doin'?  You're tellin' me you had nothin' to do with that back there?
Don't fuck with me ...
What else?
Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
Howard, give him the keys...
What if I take you with me?
You're just a nice guy, Mr. Mulvaney. Only don't fuck around with me, you know what I mean?
Where's the air conditioning?
Special to me, too.
Yeah.
No.  I had some legal training, but...
I'm glad it's okay.
It's up to you ladies.
No, not until after they killed him.
Do you remember anything else about Sal?
You stopped?  Why?
No!  I'm not kidding.  Don't you understand?  You're pure!
He's gone?
You mean that?
I want him to think that.
Sal, I'm sorry about this.  But we can get outta this thing.  There's a way outta this.
We'd kill ourselves.
I never been up in a plane before.
What?
I'm here.
I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I have to.
Nobody give their right name ... it's the FBI!
That's the jet.  You give us one more, now.  That's the deal...
Listen, I'll never make it.  I'll have to go to the toilet.
What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
Fuck!  We did it!
You did what?  Who did you talk to? What for?
We can't stay here.
If she comes down here, so help me I'm gonna mash her brains in. Everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her.  Since then, forget it.
She doesn't have anything to do with it!  You understand that? Mother?  This is me!
What'll you do?  Come out.
Maybe...
Like what?  Bank teller?  What do they get paid -  ... they pay one hundred thirty- five dollars and thirty-seven cents to start.  I got a wife and kids. I can't live on that -- You want to live on that?  What do you make a week?
What do you want us to give you? You want to be paid for ...
I don't want to be paid.  I'm here with Sal and eight other people ... and we're dyin'!  They're gonna blow our guts out, man!  You're gonna see our brains onna sidewalk! How's that for all you shut-ins and housewives to look at!  You gonna help, or you just put it on instead of AS THE WORLD TURNS?  We're dyin' here!  What have you got for me?
I LOVE YOU, DOMINO.
Bail jumper's name is Cookie Kincaid. Nineteen years old. His mommie posted bail when he was arrested for allegedly partaking in a drive-by shooting in Hawthorne.
Yes.
<i>What is it?</i>
You motherfuckin' Tino. You fucked us so bad.
Claremont, you're a chubby chaser.
Ms. Harvey... my name is Taryn Miles. I'm a criminal psychologist working for the FBI. I'm here to ask you a few questions.
Where is the money?
You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.
What was your business with Lateesha that day?
Not yet. <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT </b> Alf pulls onto the 15 FREEWAY.
Take us to Vegas. <b> EXT. DESERT ROAD -- DAY </b> The crew rides in the back of the Wanderer's truck toward Vegas. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT </b> Domino stares at Taryn as she returns to the table.
What the... <i>who is this bitch?</i> <b> EXT. HAWTHORNE COMMUNITY CENTER -- PARKING LOT -- NEXT </b> Ed and Choco exit the El Camino just as Domino retrieves her knife from the windshield. She grips it in her right hand... threatening them.
So Ed. What did you do before you became a bounty hunter?
What the fuck is your problem? Bitch!! <b> INT. SOPHIE TROMAS MANSION -- KITCHEN -- DAY </b> Domino is loading her GUN at the kitchen table as Sophie serves breakfast. Domino wolfs it down.
What do you mean? Claremont didn't provide them?
And he used to fuck a Playboy centerfold every night.
This could break new ground in terms of traditional host models. It's self-reflexive reality television.
We're covered on legal with that, right?
Yeah, I know dat motherfucker.
Talk to me.
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
Ya back is got.
My brother.
I'll fuck you up quick two times.
I own a brownstone on this block.
So?
Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way.
How much?
Sal, that might be fine, you own this, but rarely do I see any Italian Americans eating in here. All I've ever seen is Black folks. So since we spend much money here, we do have some say.
Mookie.
It's been about a year.
How long?
Squash it.
Mookie.
OK.  OK.
It's gonna be hot today.
Jade.
Is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches?
Sal's gonna be mad.
I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all.  I'm carrying you as it is.
Don't worry 'bout me.  I always get paid.
What responsibilities?
I'll do.
Mookie, no cursing in the store.
Mookie, what took you so long?  I got a business to run.
Mookie, I don't know what you're talking about, plus I don't want to hear it.
Motherfuck a window, Radio Raheem is dead.
It's supposed to be even hotter today.
Before I get off work.
Why you gotta curse?
Feels good.
Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something.  You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week.
Be a man.
Magic Johnson.
Mookie is not to be trusted.  No Moulan Yan can be trusted.  The first time you turn your back, boom, a knife right here.  In the back.
Pop, I think we should sell this place, get outta here while we're still ahead...and alive.
Pop, what else can I say?  I don't wanna be here, they don't want us here.  We should stay in our own neighborhood, stay in Bensonhurst.
How ya doin', Mookie?
Take it easy, Pop.
No, I'm not it.
Ting tao kuun jahn leeka leeka powww.
Yeah. How'd you know?
Hey guys.
O'clock?
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
Hey look, it's our teacher.
Is it true what you said to Captain Rob?
Oh, Harry, I'm so proud of you making a real friend.
Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep.  HARRY Dunne.
Here I am bragging my Mom is the tooth fairy, and I'm talking to Santa's kid!
I go to school where I live.
Oh my gosh, I don't think she's even wearing underwear!
How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
Who's Principal Collins?
We're part of a special class taught by the lunch lady, er, I mean Ms. Heller. Maybe you'd like to join us, it doesn't require any walking.
Oh, yeah. Well I almost always beat Captain Rob.
I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
You look familiar. Did I have your brother?
No.
What's with horse-boy, now he's a bright shiny sun?
Welcome to public school, my friend.
...cause you said...
What?
Sucks for you.
Oh yeah, buddy, you're gonna get "some".
HARRY, this is my fantasy! I suggest you leave - before I imagine something horrible.
Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your "girlfriend"?
Do you hear something, Captain Rob?
I know I did.
I... found that rock.
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
Ready Lloyd?
Guys, this is much better.
Beats me. It's Jessica's Dad - she said he's really anal.
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
Why are you teaching Special Needs? You're the lunch lady.
Well, what have we here? It appears be a tape.
Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
Checking up on my friend, Harry.
No, it was a complete waste of time.
Hello, little orphan boy. What happened to you?
Thanks for the grub, Mrs. D. Where's Mr. D?
He passed away three years ago.
LLOYD, may I see you a minute?
We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!
Looking for a scoop, huh? I'll give you a scoop... of short bus.  Lose her!
You know honey, I've finally figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that condo in Waikiki.
It's a surprise.
No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.
Baby, I'm going to spend the morning at the mall. You know, shop for Waikiki. Honey, what are you looking for?
The Duke is to be addresses as... -- Kynes comes forward and adjusts the Duke's suit, checking seals and pulling on straps.
Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives.  Let him stand free.
My Lord?
What does she fear?  What about my Father?
Listen to me!... you wanted to know about my dreams... and I've just had a waking dream... do you know why?... -- JESSICA Calm yourself/
Run!
Yes...
Long live the fighters!
I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals.
Well he isn't... and he won't die... Tell me he won't die!
"Beg to differ?!"  Hey, I'm talkin' about my duplex in Burbank!
Who are you?  What do you want?
I never thought of that.
Eddie, what kind of movie is this?
Ah, so I pull the strings!
Of course!  Well, we got a big day planned for you... First, we're gonna start off a little easy, with you in that armchair over there.  Then, once you're up to speed and cooking, we'll reset and bring out the laboratory equipment --
So let's make another "Dracula." Let's make "The Return of Dracula"!
"It is my home."
Bela, I don't know what I'm doin' anymore...
Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream?
Eddie, how was I?
Sorry...
Last night was quite a romp.
Yeah, she's really somethin'.
I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
Hey Ed, shouldn't we do another take? Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway.
We thought Mr. Lugosi was insured though the Screen Actors Guild.
What?
Close!  The <u>other</u> one!
Ed, I'm so proud!  I'll read it as soon as I get home.
How long have you been doing this?
Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
That's the problem!  <u>Nobody</u> cares about my movie!  I'm tryin' so hard, I don't know what else to do!
Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
Dolores, wait!
So my associate Mr. Marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture.
Oh my, this is very interesting.  Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
What other sixty-thousand?
Screen Classics?  Hmm, don't know them.
Well, Mr. Feldman, I don't believe in thinking small.  So I've got a whole slate of pictures for you: "The Vampire's Tomb," "The Ghoul Goes West"... and "Doctor Acula"!
Mr. Wood?!
Okay -- you know what you do?  You produce a film in a commercially proven genre.  And after it's a hit, you take the profits from <u>that</u>, and make the twelve Apostles' movies.
Mr. Reynolds!
Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
Excuse me, Sir...?
Yes?
Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!
And what's with this new title?!  My poster says "I CHANGED MY SEX"!
I think it's fifty-seven minutes long.
I am.  How's your father?
Does this mean you don't like sex with girls?
What was that?
The left.  It's more natural.  Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  What would that be made of?
No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's <u>more</u> advanced?
Dynamite --
The sun.
Who's Dr. Tom?
But it's pouring.  And the car top is stuck!
I don't understand.  Do you want my autograph?
You want me to show it on my TV program?  Well I got nothing to do with that.  You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven --
You don't wanna be noticed?
What's uncanny?
You know, to make the legs move --
What are you talking about?!  It's the premise of the movie.  It's even the title, for Christ's sake!
Isn't it wonderful?  Bela lives!
Why... yes.
What if I'm vomiting?
Who?
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
They celebrated the common person.
Jeanette, you're hurting me.
No.
How's your mother?
I'm moving out.
What do you mean "they're gonna have him die?"
This is real, Bananahead!
Yeah only I wish they had the sister on more.
Excuse me.
Yes, Ed.
Leave her be.
Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!
Thank you. Can I see her?
Who?
I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
Right, right...
Right.
Eddie? ...
Send him away.
Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
I know you. This Shari is a passing fancy.
How's Marcia? She all right?
Mm.
Both.
And what did he come back now for?
What's the matter?!
Who?
What?
One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex.
You're famous. Somebody called me. What are you doing in a place like this?
And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
Hi, Mom. 
What is she, at work?
She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself.
You batted or you bunted?
Yeah...
I hear the dog really liked him.
You do though, you look great.
What do you want?!
Don't defend that horse's ass to me.
Ha!
Really?
Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you.
That's lucky.
I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done.
I have no privacy. Even now! I'm crying and I can't stop and they won't go away. And now it's going to be another month!
Everybody hates me!
No. Who?
A poll. "Is Shari Good Enough for Ed?" Seventy-one per cent said "no."  They hate me!
I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City.
So?
Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.
Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.
What are you drunk?
I ... I'm not gonna do it.
Yeah?!
Ray --
What's the dif --
She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --
What is this? What's going on, who is that?
I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired?
I was in jail.
The whole time? Eighteen years?
What...
Sign here, please.
Don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that.
Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.
Having a problem with your eye there?
Mostly Tammy fans
Hey, that's super
You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.
I thought you were supposed to keep them.
I can't wait to start campaigning.
Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down.
These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.
I don't.  I just know they were there when I left.  I'm giving you helpful information is all.  You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.
Yes?
I'm looking at new cars.
Coming to see me.  Are you trying to. . humiliate me?
So... what do you have to tell me?
Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little.
So what do you think?  Should we get a room?
Should we get a what?
points at the motel.
Yep.
Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
Yeah.  But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.
Whoa! Easy, Fouch. I don't like where you're going.
Way to go, Tracy!  Isn't this exciting?
Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.
How's the left these days?
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style.
I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't really friends. You know what I mean?
Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
Pierce meets people.  Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood.  This is how they turned out.  Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little.
It's Lynn.
There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
Look.  I want to see you again.
When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
So you saved her.
Lad, may I have a word with you?
Of course... But how?
Mrs. Lefferts, I'm Officer White with the L.A.P.D.  I'd like to ask a couple of questions.
Tell me about the boyfriend she had.  The one you mentioned at the morgue.
Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down.
The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle.
Patchett's dead.  He sent you after me.  I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends.
Ellis Loew.
Bud...
Thanks, but no thanks.
Why were Lefferts' eyes black?
Officer White.  I heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters.
Should I?
His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
Meeks is probably in Rio or someplace like that by now.
If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way.  What are these smears in the blood?
Clean?
Nothing.
That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.
Nothing, Ray.  That Larry, he's a pisser.  You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?
Gone.  Not a trace.
Take it easy!  I didn't have anything to do with him getting killed if that's what you mean.
Okay.  Okay.  Everyone knows Patchett's worth a boat-load of greenbacks.  From aviation, freeway construction.  But the man has hobbies, too.  He bankrolls B movies under the table and runs movie star look-alike hookers. And try this on:  he's rumored to be a periodic heroin sniffer.  All in all a powerful behind-the- scenes strange-o.
Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the key to all relationships.
Dudley, we've been over this.
No.
No... Where'd the tip come from?
I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund.
You think golden boy can handle it, Cap?
Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.
I should've known.  What's the Chief throwing you?
Glasses.
I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I can't hear your confession.
Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?
What?
Decorated?
The Nite Owl.  Anything bothering you about the case?
Why's she seeing Bud White?
It galls you that I know so much about you.  You don't have information to compete.
Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
You lost me, Sid.  Who?
No.  But I've got something going with Ad Vice.
Sid, cut the crap.  I --
You didn't get my message?  It got called off.  The kid chickened out at the last minute.
He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
And you were the last one to talk to him.
Someone else?
209 to anyone! I need some help here!
I don't know what that means.
Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone.
Why don't you just call Brill directly.
I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.
I don't know what that means.
They're spooks.
Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
What if I find out what they're after. You know these people, I don't.
And you won't. Now move--
I was worried about my hundred and twenty 'K'.
Jesus!
I called my wife!
I didn't use my name.
None of your business.
I intercepted phone calls.
They come after you?
Well, actually, <u>you</u> have proof. Could you walk a little faster please.
They're here.
You sure?
These guys are incredibly persistent.
So what do we do now?
What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.
Nah, they'd shut down the pin number.
Reynolds.
Who's calling?
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
Most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement.
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
Is it okay?
You'd like to buy your wife some lingerie as a Christmas gift.
Yes. I have her permission.
Eight.  Size eight.
Listen, Daniel, hang on one second.
I'm sorry. Detective Morelos.
A police report.
I'm no expert, but I'm assuming that the impact of a moving bus against his body caused--
I'm just trying to determine if Mr. Zavitz was involved in something more than a simple bus accident.
Nobody gave you <u>anything</u>?
So you tap everyone's phone? You use computers to probe financial records? New Search and Seizure laws?
Something bad happened tonight.
What'd you buy at Harrison's?
Yeah.
Sorry.
I think you should leave now, Robert.
Stacy, don't hang up.
It wasn't me.
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
The lingerie.
That was for Christmas.
Is it over?
A friend of mine. I don't know his real name. He's dead now.
It's a brand new card.
Maybe it's not connected yet.
I'm sure we can locate it for you, sir.
That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
When do I get to meet him?
Never.
I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
I <u>like</u> our history. And I like you. I'd probably like <u>Brill</u> if I ever got to--
I'm gonna fix it.
I'm sorry about that.
Any idea what he looks like?
Otherwise you may have to what?
God knows I would, sir, but I have a previous engagement this evening.
Last night, Larry Spinks, he works the Steel Press, he goes to a bar with his wife Rosalie to have a glass of chianti 'cause it's his birthday, and these two guys, these Guido mother-fuckers, they jump him when he goes to the bathroom.
Where's Stacy?
You're learning a cruel lesson.
Are those my Christmas presents?
Can I open 'em up?
In your dreams.
Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
Table 122?
Christ!
Rachel's dead?
You gotta--
I have a family.
Bobby? Piece of advice?
Turn yourself in.
It's me, Robert Dean.  From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on--
It's been a few years.
Yeah.
The police?
Yes sir.
Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
You're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? <i>Terrorism,</i> you unconscionable asshole?
We found the originals.
We'd have to--
Hiding something?
So they know everything.
Federal Express for 'Zavitz'.
Federal Express?
They don't see foreign women in this market.  How much did you pay?
I was concerned.  As I said, women in that part of Cairo, a European women, I felt obliged to.
What do you mean, poetry?
I'm quite all right, thank you.
No.
- there is the Harmattan, a red wind. Which Mariners called the sea of darkness.  Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England, producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood. Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still awake.
Fiction.  We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on.  More.
I'm impressed you can sew.
This is a different world - is what I tell myself.  A different life. And here I am a different wife.
Of course.  You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
No.
Don't talk.
And a good read.  Don't waste it.
Uxoriousness - that's my favorite kind of love.  Excessive love of one's wife.
Are you mad?  Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.
I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife.  I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her.  I think she's know herself.
Very well.
I see.
Do you have your papers, sir?
You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
I was talking about the girl.
Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow.  I'm going to do what I can, but  And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so.
Would it? She kisses him, very softly, on the lips.
Is this you?
Yes, I've been asking for weeks, a month, I don't know, also my leg was -
Go!  Hey!  Go! Caravaggio is in terror.
Are you Hana?
If you said yes I would have had a reason.  You should let me redress those bandages.  Before you go.
I'm not in love with him.  I'm in love with ghosts.  And so is he. He's in love with ghosts.
Who are his ghosts?
I don't know what that means.
I think that's called looting.
I think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her.
Are you planning to be the exception?
Moose.
There are going to be trials, they want me to interpret, don't they know I'm allergic to courtrooms?
Aren't you?
Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
I will hide you in the room where we sleep, said Candaules. She stumbles over the word.
Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
There's a man downstairs.  He brought us eggs.  He might stay.
He needn't disturb you.
He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?
I've been told that before.
You like him, don't you?  Your voice changes.
Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -
It's okay - I'll help.  Please.
I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.
Okay.  Get away from here.  Quick.
I try not to expect you.
This is hot!
Will you come with me?
Of course.  When?
He can't even move.
Only we have to go to work.
Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!
Kip?
Why?  Are you German?
How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?
You tell me.  I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France.
So he popped the pane?
That's great if you're a computer. In the real world that pane weighs 200 pounds. The building's 600 feet high.
You ordering chop suey again?
You're saying the thief wants us to think it's Mac but it's really not.
They've never caught him before, what makes you think they'll catch him now?
How close?
I'm in the middle.
I have a question...
I can't?
How about if I try humility.
Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows?  Check, please.
I'll call an ambulance.
Yes. But they don't have a clue.  Why would anyone steal my luggage?
You're not taking me seriously.
I didn't expect you to be so...
I know.
Motorcycle.
I don't believe this.
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
What's my problem? You want a list?
Nice spot.
We? Are you implying that I'm taking you inside?
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
Someone was expecting that.
I'll need that.
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
Won't take any time.
Aren't we early?
Popup, on floorboards. And--
It's a party.
One, two, three...
STOP! You're making...mistake.
No, really, it's your plan, you should get at least 30 per cent--
Come on, what can you do with six billion you can't do with four?
Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
Idle hands, the devil's workshop.
The Mask. Where is it?
Do you know what you've done!? Do you know?
Oh my god, I thought--
So how long till we do this?
Can't be too careful.
Two men in the world don't need passwords or codes. Their retinas will scan to unlock everything. one of those two men is the chairman of the bank.
That's because you grew up rich.
You gave them the eight billion.
In the van.
If we don't bypass it, the temperature in the Mask room will change and set off the alarm. That would be inconvenient.
I need you to get one more thing for me. A dress, elegant but sexy, something Grace Kelly would wear. Maybe a Balenciaga.
That's it, I sure as hell ain't no personal shopper.
The early bird gets the damn worm.
Suspicious, after all these years?
You're impressed with her, aren't you?
My friend, you always surprise me.
So.  You must've been feeling pretty desperate that afternoon.
I added air conditioning, put in the pool, made all those pillows by hand ...
Cause of the chromium.
It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
You wouldn't happen to have a little time right now, would you, Donna?
I don't even know how much money that is.
Yup.
They took some bone from my hip and put it in my neck.  I didn't have insurance, so I'm about seventeen thousand in debt right now.
You said things would be fine, and they're not.
Give her a cold washcloth to suck on --  I gotta go -- there's a clean one in that bag -- I'll check back in a bit.  Sorry.  My kid --
Look, I'm sorry.  You were gone.  I just assumed you were off having fun.
I don't know.  Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun.
So what's the story on this thing?  This cancer stuff?
This is the only thing you found?
So you think we got 'em scared?
Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the bathroom.  They'll be driving around the valley for hours.
And this shit is bad news, Mr. Masry.  Not only does it attack every organ of the body, it fucks with your DNA, too.  That means these people's genes, and the genes of their kids, and the genes of their grandkids --
They used the hex chrom here, in these cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive.  Then they dumped it here, in these six ponds.
They skipped that step.
What do you mean?
Oh, they knew.  They had to know.
Someone's following me.
What?  Who?
Oh, Jesus.  You wanna tell me what the problem is here, or --
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
Erin, it's just a meeting.
Bullshit.  You'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you.
Okay, look.  It's an important meeting. Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --
Look, this is serious now.  They're talking serious money --
You're not gonna be there.
I wasn't gonna --
Did he say why?
Mommy, can I get a flower?
Masry & Vititoe, can I help you?
Randy's mom said yes right away.
Okay, look -- I think we got off on the wrong foot here --
I had a good neighbor, George.  She was 60 and Mexican and she watched my kids for free.  Something tells me you're not gonna be able to measure up to that.
Why not?
Great.  Another deadbeat.
I'm not a deadbeat.  I work when I need to.
Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
You're around every afternoon?
What are you doing here?
Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again.  Would that make you happy?
I'm just saying -- we have one night to ourselves, why do we have to spend it here?
Hello?
No, I need my car --
Jaguar's a darn pretty car.
Where's my paycheck?
You're moving away?  When?
Oh.  Oh.
Well, look, there isn't a ton of information here, but from what there is, I'd say that these two people here -- what are their names?  Shanna and Ashley?
Right, I guess those are the kids --
... and when I realized our area's just as bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too.  So I went and asked.
Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....
He'll learn.
Told you, I did.  Reckless is he ... Now things are going to worse.
Will you?  You underestimate The Emperor.  It is you he wants ... that is why your friends suffer.
Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips.
... Like we're being watched.
Looking?  Looking?  You've found someone I'd say.  Heh?  Yes!
Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land here, and if I could get my fighter out of this puddle I would, but I can't.  So ...
Give me that!
Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?
We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
What is thy bidding, My Master?
I have felt it.
Our destruction?  Who?
He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
Good, and Commander Skywalker?
Thank you, General.  But there's a price on my head.  If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man.
I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
You, too, golden rod.
I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.
And what are they, pray tell?
Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.
You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind.
Hey!  Someone's still in here.
Would it help if I got out and pushed?
I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?
That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
Now you're making sense.
You mean a man you can control.
Are you crazy!
You could have warned him before you shut him off.
Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.
Never heard of that system.
Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.
A mining colony.
Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
No thanks.
I was worried about you.
I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.
Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
Not really.
Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must be closed. I can't wait any longer.  I'm sorry.
A tremor!
Artoo, you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ...
I thought those seekers were set for stun!
I'll die first.
Go easy, Stevie.
I mean he's of your race. He's an Ape.  Look.  You don't have to be afraid.  We've put him in chains and under sedation. Do you understand that?
The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an undercover cop. She injected you with incentive toxin. Right now it's swimming in your bloodstream. It'll start to take effect in 9 hours.
Where is he?
It's so good to see you again.
That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
Only a handful of people are aware of its existence. Let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon.
Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there.  Once you go inside, you're on your own.  You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
Lock fuel rods.
Plissken...?
Stop the damn car.
What're you doing in here?
Looking to get out.
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours.
No screamin' shit.
I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
You're running out of time.
Where's the anti-toxin...?
Fight me from your horse or on foot, but fight me. Your avoidance mocks me.
Rise, Mordred.
He is the mightiest and fairest of knights.
No, I think it's better if you just stay here to heal. At least a week.
If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
Who does it serve?
I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
A lovestruck page!
You know what I want. I want the secret of true magic, how to thicken the stuff of dreams and wishes with the flesh of the world.
Why it's perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you don't want the building torn down.
Well what's wrong?
You'd want to do the exorcism yourself?
And you got an invitation.
Well, when I went to get the Thorazine I had him to stay with her and... Oh, I should of known better.
Oh Burke! Poor Burke!
This was under Regan's pillow. Did you put it there?
Where do you want this?
No, she was heavily sedated.
May I ask...?
You were expecting a deliver y that day?
Incidentally, just a chance in a million, I know; but your daughter - you could possibly ask her if she saw Mr. Dennings in her room that night?
Good morning Madame.
Rats?
Bastard! I will kill you.
Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?
Why the math?
Depression?
The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms.
Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.
Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.
No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?
Thanks. Look, I'm only against the possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good.
Yes. He's already here.
We'll see when we get home okay.
When can I have one?
Oh, Captain Howdy....
You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?
Oh Regan I love your daddy. I'll always love your daddy. Burke just comes around here a lot because he's lonely, don't got nothin' to do.
How do you know?
My bed was shaking, I can't get to sleep.
Oh, Christ.
That's an insult, I got a vow of poverty.
I stole it.
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
He broke the bread, gave it to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you and eat. For this is my body." When the supper had ended, he took the cup, again he gave you thanks and praise. Gave the cup to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you will drink from it, this is the cup of blood, the blood of the new and ever lasting covenant and the mystery of faith".
No now.
You speak Latin?
Bon Jour.
Is that too tight?
And let my cry come unto thee.
And also with you.
What is it?
I've seen him.
Yeah, a fall.
Hey, Father? You like movies?
That's to bad.
MERRIN!!!!!!!
Shove it up your ass you faggot!
Fuck him Karras!!! Fuck him!!!
You're not going to drive!
Little slow tonight.
Your pay.
I've got the grands for two nights, Charlie.  You can't just --
Trunks?
Honey ...
Where are our kids? Has he got one of them in there?
What's our friend's problem?
They gotta go.
Oh, look at you two.  So skinny. And those tiny suits ...
What's the gig?
Am I late?
What's wrong with it?
Lotta water.
Count it.
You mind telling me what that was about in there? Was that planned? Or were you just bored and decided to get creative?
Listen ... why don't you come out to the house this weekend.  Say hello to the kids. They've grown.
Cindy.
What d'ya got?,
You know, I think it's been five years since I saw you eat anything. That's the God's truth.
What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
Funny.  Strike a bell?
No, I mean it.
Says who?
It's not family.  It's business.
What?
The trees.  The flowers.  Nice.
Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
Frank.  Fuck it.  Okay?
Let's get it over with.
You're getting cold feet about this.
I'll drop the eighths.
You're a fucking alarm clock.
No.
Make it collect.
Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then.
So what do you think?
You want to come out to the house tomorrow? The way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided to really lay it on.  Turkey, stuffing, the whole bit.  Kitchen's so full of food you can hardly move.  We could use another appetite.
I thought we had separate rooms.
Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
Have some more wine, Frank.
No! I never hear it!  Maybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know. But I won't let it bother me.
What?
How come I didn't hear anything?
The party's over.
April.
I always think of him on New Year's. How he used to pour us each half a can of beer. Remember?
What?
You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie?  We're in for three weeks solid, Jack.
What's it for?
Look.  I didn't know when we were going to be on until yesterday.  What was I supposed to do? I had the pianos anyway.
What?
No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.
I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're doing the stone today.  It's okay?  Wednesday?
Yeah, fine.
Hey, what do you know.  Looks like we can have that drink after all.  What's your pleasure?  We got the downtown Ramada. We got the Travelodge on Route 41. And ... the Mallory.
I'll take the Mallory.
I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
I'm sorry?
Moran.  Monica.  The whole thing. It's my stage name.  My real name's Blanche.
Candy Man.'  Is that all right?
Look, miss.  We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.
Where's my name?
Come on.  We don't have much time.
Save it for your wife.
Uh... good.
Right.
Baker's unabridged.
Go ahead.
Smells like tuna number two to me.
Hey, will you look at that?
Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I thought maybe...
Whatcha doin' over there?
Funny hours.
No, I, uh, left a dog here this morning. He needed some work on his mouth.
Yeah.
The name's Baker --
Aren't the kids asleep?
In and out.
You're upset.
She's four feet tall.  Ed?
I have to make him some chili. Okay?
Oh. So what's it doing here?
You're kidding.
Coffee?
What kind?
Vegetables.
Hi.
I didn't want to wake you.
What happened to the donut king?
Oh.  Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
Ivory.
From Hurley's?
Sure.
Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?
Do I look wasted -- asshole?
What did he do?
... Thanks.
Uh-oh, somebody's in trouble.
My place.
Go on, Adam ...  I'm not asking you for anything -- I was never even going to tell you. But hell, I never thought I'd see you again, either.
Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.
She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
I'm late for surgery.
... I was dreaming ...
Something good?
We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.
Never mind that!  Just take Jamie and get out of that house.  Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.
Whoever you are, don't call again.
What do you mean?
Jon, what is it?
How is he?
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
Apparently, fine.  He's coming into work.  That's the good news ...
How is the "date night" idea going over with Eve?
I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
Jamie ...
When did you start smoking?
You mean like ... condoms?
There's my little darling.  The night wouldn't be complete without you.
A lot of people think you're a snitch.  It's dangerous ...
Me.  I have doubts about your ability to stick with what is essentially a desk job.
Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.
Where's Jamie?
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
Mr. Mintz.
Were almost done here...
This isnt my real life. Its just a glimpse...
Who did?
You know how to make chocolate milk?
You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
This is day care.  Its where babies go when their parents are at work.
Big Eds?  Big Eds Tires?  Why...?
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
So Jack, its your wifes birthday, got anything to say to her?
Wheres my car?!  Wheres my Ferrari!?
What do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? You're just gonna do something you'll regret...
Brought what on myself?! I didnt do anything!
Give me my goddamn life back!
How much time?!
As long as it takes to figure it out.  Which, in your case, could be considerable.
Sorry, pal.  Entrance is for residents and guests only...
For us, Kate.
Go. Im sorry, you should just go...
Jack...dont even start...
Hey!  I was watching that!
Shouldnt we grab some dinner first?  Maybe a bottle of wine...?
Do what?
Our life in a nutshell...
If you want to look at it that way...
You want the cake!?
Cmon, you know what I like to hear...
You really are incredible...
Heres the thing.  I really hadnt planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight.  You know, anniversarys good all day...
Whats the difference? Im taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
And now...?
You know champagne makes me do crazy things.
My god, all this time...I never stopped loving you...
I could stay here forever...
Think bigger.
Its been interesting, thats for sure.
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
Jesus, Jack...
Dont get on that plane!
Mrs. Peterson.
And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead.  Not yet anyway...Come, lets get you some help.  Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
Peter.  I don't see you rushing home to trim the tree.
Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
Do I know you?
No...Im not...
It's Christmas Eve, Jack.
Jersey?  You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
Do you want me to look for the box or call the airline?
Ill go for a cup of coffee!
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
What?  Come on.  She's got a good thing with Victor --
It's about to be a broken face.
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
No more cracks about how I look.
I'll be watching over you.
What did you wish for, honey?
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
You look like an eighties rock band.
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
He's right.  These costumes are... missing something.  I can't put my finger on it --
I though we went over this.
Sweet.
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl...the Invisible Girl.
You two need a time-out.
Is that what you call it?  "<i>Real</i>"?
Look around, sis!  <u>She's not here</u>.  So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
Sis.  Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
Leonard, how's the feed?
Ben did this.
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
It has to be the cloud.  It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
And reverse the mutations --
I can...make it work.
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
'Scuse me.
Before or after what he wanted to tell you?
<Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.
But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
Yes, Alan.
I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --
Yes, Cora.
I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
That could be quite a lethal weapon... It could kill, not cure.
If you had a transistor about this size and power output, and a thin enough wire --  -- could you piece it together?
Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.
I've done all I could with the laser.
All I'm asking is you test it beforehand!
Isn't there another surgical procedure you can try?
"Yet all the suns that light the Corridors of the Universe shine dim, Before the blazing of a Single Thought -- "
The ship's good as finished. We'll have to get out on our own! Is there a quick way out?
What about Dr. Michaels?
About forty miles an hour.
In a way -- yes. Those are impurities imbedded in the Lung after a lifetime of 'Civilization.' Carbon from smoke and smog -- specks of dust --
We're entering the Lymphatic System. Those are nuclei of cells, lining a Duct.
Hold it, Skipper.  What happens if we overstay?
What happened?
I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
No Jean, no money!
This is a new car, then, sir?
... What is he, deaf?... So, uh, how long have you been with the escort service?
...Look at that. Twin Cities.  IDS Building, the big glass one.  Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest.  After the Sears, uh, Chicago...  You never been to Minneapolis?
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -
...Blood has been shed.
IS IT, JERRY?  You ask those three pour souls up in Brainerd if a deal's a deal! Go ahead, ask 'em!
Oh, yah, I know that!
I thought you'd never ask. The older one is Janet, she's nine, and the younger one is Morgan.
He's three now. Course, not in that picture.
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
Officer Olson.
Just a general way.
Uh-huh.
Yah.
They said they were goin' to the Twin Cities?
Good to see ya again, Jerry. If these numbers are right, this looks pretty sweet.
They're playin' the Buckeyes!
Dad, I really think we should call the cops.
Huh? Yah?
What... What is it all about?
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.
Ma'am, I answered your question.  I answered the darn - I'm cooperating here, and I...
Sir? Right now?
Hon? Got the growshries.
Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it.
Yah, well, they exist all right.
I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.
Yah.
Where're you going?
Yah.
Stan and I're okay.
What the heck were you thinkin'? Heck, if I'm only gettin' bank interest, I'd look for complete security. Heck, FDIC. I don't see nothin' like that here.
No! They said no cops! They were darned clear on that, Wade! They said you call the cops and we -
You're darned tootin'!
... Stan, I'm thinkin' we should offer 'em half a million.
Never heard of him. Don't vouch for him.
Yah, thanks a bunch. So what's the deal, now? Gary says triple homicide?
...Well, that passed.
Well, he's got his gun on his hip there, and he looks like a nice enough guy. It's a real shame.
Yah.
Gotta go?
Yah, I'm down in the Twin Cities and I was just watching on TV about these shootings up in Brainerd, and I saw you on the news there.
Yah?
Geez! You look great!
Oh, yah, couple years now. It's actually Eden Prarie - that school district. So Chief Gunderson, then! So ya went and married Norm Son-of- a-Gunderson!
Oh, yah, a long time ago.
...I was married to Linda Cooksey -
And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.
Well, I always liked you, Mike.
His wife?
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
Thanks, hon.
Yah, okay. How's the hotel?
Not on your feet too much?
When they're stuck with a bunch a the old ones!
We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?
Oh, my.
After fight club, everything else in your life gets the volume turned down.  You can deal with anything.
Have you finished those reports?
"The second rule of fight club... Is this yours?
I'd like to thank the academy...
I'll expose you.
It becomes an addiction.
Well, technically, I have more of a right to be there than you.  You still have your balls.
I want that.
That's your favorite, too?  Tried to slip it by me, eh?
We'll split it.  You get it the first and third Sunday of the month.
Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers?
Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.
Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape.
Here.
Here.
Uh ... nah.
When?
I don't know.
That... sawing and hammering.
No.
Marla, it's me.  Have we... have we ever had sex?
Is this a trick?
What did you say... ?
Marla...
I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
You have to get out of here.  Leave as soon as possible.  Go to any rural town, away from any major city...
Marla...
I'm not paying this back.  I consider it "asshole tax."
I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
What?
Excuse me?  "Throwers?"
Tonight, we're going to open the green door -- the heart chakra...
It's getting exciting now.
What?
Being clever.
There's always that.
Delivered from Martha Stewart.
What list?
Well, I have to file a claim...
I don't follow...
You called me so you could have a place to stay.
Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
Would that be a problem?
A nice, big cock.
Where's your car?
What?
Any historical figure.
She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts.
Homework assignment.
Why wasn't I told about "Project Mayhem?"
What do you want?  A statement of purpose... ?
Look...
This does not belong to us.  We are not the leaders.  We are not special.
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.  We are all part of the same compost heap...
What the hell ... ?!
If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
... is over.
Why do people think I'm you?
People think that you're me, because you and I happen to share the same body.
What... what are you saying?
You could be standing under 37 stories of steel and concrete with a 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped to the support... oh, maybe it couldn't be...
I'm pulling the green wire.
Please...
How'd you do that?!  You're a fucking figment of my imagination... you're psychogenic fugue state...
Why what?
Appreciate something.
Who is this?
You told me you'd say that, too.
No, no.  This is a man -- this man has a name...
Robert Paulson?
Kimberly Burroughs, eh?  What do you want?
Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
Congratufuckinglations.  That makes you last to go.  But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.  Always does.
Please, what else could it mean?
What did you see?  What am I looking for?
No!  It can't be.
Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can.
I had tickets to go, but one day I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign.
Yeah.  Who does he think he is? Knight Rider?
What was the fight about?
Yeah, so what happened?
I'm not following you --
Turn around.  The cleaning woman said they're at the dentist's. 14th and Main.
New life defeats death?  Follow the signs?  Where the hell did you find that guy?
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
I know it's crazy, but I'm really scared for the others.  I've got this terrible feeling.
It's only the end of June.
I'm... really sorry.
I don't understand... did you see Tod die? Did it happen again, like on the plane?
Get out! Get out of the car!  Get out of the fuckin' car!
You're the fuckin' devil.
And then the cabin banged and the left side exploded. The the whole plane... blew up. It was so real. Exactly how everything goes.
I'm... a friend of his. His best friend. See, his father...
That's what I'm doin'!
What's that?
... then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo!  I swear to Christ.
Show me how it operates.
That's what I'm here for.
Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
That's it?  Some C-4, a map and a knife?
These guys look like they'd sell their mothers.
Roundeye.
You better take off.
Can you handle the door gun?
You're gonna love it.
Where's Nguyen now?  What city?
Huntington Beach, California.
Are you okay?
Go United States.  See Nguyen. Maybe teach economics.  Buy Cadillac.  Watch "Dynasty."
Why me?
... and then he, uh... took the other one.
You think they'll find any?
Listen, Kirkhill.  I'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... I thought I'd go out with the extraction team tonight.  Unless you have an objection.
It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said "No POWs" the sub-committee would buy it.  He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own.  If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C.  Airtight. But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero. Thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something.  He put me in a corner.  No choice.
I hear you're not enjoying it here.
That depends on you.  Christ, look at you.  I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it Rambo's last stand.
Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
Let's do it.
I think some people are meant to be alone.  Maybe I was a man in a former life and I used women for pleasure so now I'm paying for it - which would be fine, if I could just remember some of the pleasure parts... 
No really..I can't.
I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous.  It's the only reason to go out with a bum.
It happens to be a beautiful love story.  Ya know, you used to like that about me.  You used to say you liked that I didn't make you think so much.  That we could be together and not think...
Two kids tried to set me on fire.
You still believe in God?
Oh stop.  Things will change.  My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second.
I was not with a woman last night.  I was out with Parry.
Ugh, these tapes are a mess.  I don't know where to begin...
First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what time do you need?  What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>?  Have I ever... ever pressured you!?
He can't hear you.  Hi...I'm Dr. Weintraub....  I was on duty when they brought him in...I've been going over his record... He was brought in once before I understand...  ..."catatonic  stupor"...condition  rendered him non-verbal for a period of -...
Remember. One chorus and out.
Come on now...You can't sit here.
They're putting me on film tomorrow.
Fine.
Your name was picked.
Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
You get a VCR with the membership.  ... For a short time until you get your own.  Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out.  See if you're interested.
Lydia.  Lydia what?
Have I died?
My abode... My domicile... My neck of the woods... Hungry?  Breakfast?  A fruit pie perhaps?
No... thanks... Listen --
<u>What</u>!?
They said you're The One.
But I need help and <u>they</u> sent you.
Why did you do that?
Well what am I gonna do with it?
Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.
Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.
It's such a great song.
Are there any questions?
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
Unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass of a one balled donkey!
It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
Parry Parry?
No just Parry.
How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's "The Purple Bread," an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery.  In subtitles.
I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.
What are we about to do?
I don't drink coffee...
... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
Listen, you're very nice... b...
Yeah, 'cause she's so "twinky"...
Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front.
Serveza yourself!
Now, now.
You know what, you are never satisfied.
You just going to sit there?
I'm sorry.
Elton and Stoney know how I feel about you. An' they're just goin' to think I'm not too nice a guy, which I'm not, an' that you're a hell of a person puttin' up with me, that's all.
I love it.
"Every trail that you blaze/Makes me..."
Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.
This certainly is an improvement on the motel an' the coffee shop.  How could you have left such a beautiful place, Bobby?
I'm gonna go in that cafe an' get some coffee. You want anything?
How far are you going to?
Washington.
Who?
Well...
I know what it comes with, but that's not what I want.
Oh my goodness... Bobby...
No, no, I don't think that, I'm just curious about it...  Do you think I'm a freak?
I probably am, but I don't care. I mean, I wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would I have had time to make any improvements...
Where is she, anyway?
You're leaving?
You were going without saying goodbye?
Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
The day after tomorrow.
One thing that's hard to understand is how you could have this incredible background in music, and then just walk away from it, without a second thought...
Why?
It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.
Wait...
It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.
No, I want to talk to you now. I have to explain something about...
No, you don't have to, it isn't necessary...
No, I can't...
And living out here, in this rest home asylum, that's what you want?
... which should exclude you from any objective discussion. But keep in mind, even the arts aren't free of aggressive content, nor the institution of marriage.
That's exactly what I am doing, again.
Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.
Aaron, how you doin'?
Not now, I'm busy
Wussup?
Hi.
So what's her name?
So wadda you do with your girls?
I did.
Fa what?
What are you going that way for?
Amanda is Eddie's cousin.
You gonna talk to him?
You sure? She's got kind of like brown hair.
Positive.
Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
Probably.  One of the many.
What?
Yeah.
Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
Maybe I'm not going to keep you here.  Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.
I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia, do you?
Thanks for coming down to see us.
This one's going to be even more fun.
I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now.
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
Like tonight.
Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.
Is there anything particular you're looking for?
You should have proved that in a court of law.
You may be right.
Good evening.
Okay.  Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
Forgive me now for seeming personal, but we understand that there is a lady friend he sees here in Provo.
Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk.
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
We can't talk about it here.
Because we can't.
Alan Stanwyk.
Maybe I'm just on vacation.
Where am I going?
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?
That's right.
Will you kill me?
Can I steal you for a minute?
Only if you promise not to return me.
Did you hear something?
'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.'
Not our kind of people, you understand.
I just thought... sure.  Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
Cute young thing, too.
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are.
Oh, mine! Thank God.  Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?
John who?
So were my parents.
You are a rich woman.
Hi.
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?
I think you should call me Gail, now.
Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him.
Who.
How do you know about that?
Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented...
Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.
Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.
You shouldn't be here.
Yes, I'm with the Underhills.
They just left, sir.
Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?
Cabana one.
You want I set up?
No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
No wonder.
I commend him on his choice.
I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.
I'm calling the cops. This is for the cops.
Fletch.
Uh, almost.
Irwin...
No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
What's 'practically'? Is it Fat Sam? You said you had pictures of him....
I'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that?
Utah?
How could you call him?
This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. 
No, I ain't got you...
My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon.
So you...
We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
Art Mo-o-o-ney!
Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter.
All your friends call you Jazz.
Make eye contact when you say that.
Yeah, let's bury her.
Ah, an obvious choice.
C.D.s.  The music kind.  From the Grendel label.
Got those Vomit invites here...
How much?
It's red, Ford.
Why are all these people after me?
Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
People still watch that?
Hey.  God.  You're an asshole.
I can't kill this kid's father...
I'm sorry...
These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
Where's my father?  Have you even looked?
'Booty Time.'
God, I wish I could prove you killed everybody.  Unfortunately, I know who the real killer is.
I knew your father.  He was quite...
It doesn't have to be like this?
I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
Mr. Doyle.
No - no.
How's everything?
Boca?
No, nothing.  There's only some talk.
Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.
Where'm I goinna get a pizza this time o' night?
Sal --
Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears.
It's your problem.
Formidable!  Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker.  Je suis pass voir Franoise.
Il fallait le faire.
J'ai pas confiance en lui.
I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.
Where from?
Strike out, eh?
Look.  My partner and I found this case and I don't want no Feds screwing it up.
The greaser with the blonde.
What for -- you wanna play Hide the Salami with his old lady?
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
Why not?
What happened to you?
Why is it called Hellgate?
I'm straight, Joel.  They haven't got shit on me.  Look, I'm tellin' you, he'll take the deal somewhere else.
You remember Mary Finelli?
Sexual assault, Daryl.  Five years.  But you got lucky, right?  You got away with something else.  Something you figured nobody knows about.
Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?
We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now.
He did.
Frank...what's wrong?
I know.  He loves that thing.
Okay, I'm on it.  Hey.
I swear, Satch.
Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.
I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
I don't really follow baseball anymore.
...WB2YXB calling unidentified station, Queens.  CQ 15.
The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.
Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.
I'm dreaming this.  Shit, this is a dream.
You just burned the desk.
I'm thirty-five years old.
Thirty-five?  That would make it...
Don't go.  Don't go in that warehouse...
When?
Dad, we did something.  Something to make it worse.
Whatta you mean...
Something we did changed the case...changed history.  Mom wasn't dead.  But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened.  And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women.
We're okay...we're good, Dad.
I'm right here, Dad.
What?
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
We got him!  Dad you got him!
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
Right, now I need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.
Hey, OK if Gordy uses your old gear?
My father didn't die in a fire?
Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.
I better give you my address then.
Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.
Don't choke on your pride, Sull.  You ain't ever gonna catch another one like that.
April 16...?  That means she was the first.
Got a minute?
I try to be.
I look familiar?
A hot shot, huh?
What is that?
I found this today.  There were other pieces of the body lying there, but I believe "he" wanted me to have this...
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
You're all just jealous.
How about a roll in the hay?
Which one is it?
You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
Look what I found.  Remember these?
And, what about us?
When you dropped me off at the house, it was very late.  My parents were waiting up for me. As soon as I got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me.  I was so upset... I told them I slept with you.  My mothers slapped me.  That was the first time she'd ever hit me.  I couldn't believe it.  I ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as I could run. I was crying.  They had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and I wanted to punish them for that.  I decided to hide out all night.  They'd be so worried that they'd be sorry for what they did to me.  The woods were cold and damp from the rain.  I found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and I guess I fell asleep.  All I can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps.  I thought it was my father so I hid behind the tree. But the footsteps just stopped. The woods were dark.  I couldn't see anything.  I heard a cracking noise behind me.  I turned around and... and... oh, God... there was this hideous looking man.  So grotesque he was almost inhuman.  He had a knife and he started to slash away at me, again and again.  I was so hysterical and I don't know how I was able to get away.  I ran and ran, but he kept coming.  He was big but so fast.  He caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he... he... ripped my blouse off. I was screaming, but who could hear me?  Then... oh, God... he dragged me by the hair along the ground.  I was kicking and yelling.  He dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods.  Oh, please... please...
Are they following us?
I just want you to like me.
You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green," with an arrow pointing this way.
Darren, we better turn around.
Why?
It's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge.  Jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch's mind.
Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
You just sit tight, Jason.  Once the authorities from Carpenter get here, you'll...
Not what...who.  Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
Daddy, what is going on?
There...Ya happy?
Are you sure this is gonna work? I mean, why didn't we bring that gun and just blast him away?
So what happened?
That's debatable.
I can't believe no one called back.  I better...
Jason is alive.  We dug up his body.  I was gonna cremate it and...
You got me where you want me. There's no reason not...
-- look, just shut up.  Let's cut through the shit.  You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap.  One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
So let's talk.
Ed...
Hello...
You're talking about my lady.
Tell me.
I mean, how can you go through life without never having made a prank call?
Oh, c'mon, would you stop, please?
Oh my God, Steven.
Yeah...
How many times do you want to hear this?
My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.
That's it. You're not setting foot off this ship until we return home.
You have no right...
That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded...  It's no coincidence.
I don't think that's such a safe idea
You've been coming out here every summer for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven't learned how.
You pushed me...
You let me worry about him, okay?  Personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers, Rennie. You made the right decision.
Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.
Have you seen my dog anywhere?
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
When did this start?
I heard you weren't coming.
What about you?
You are going where?
You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.
How is Lillian? I haven't seen her.
But didn't we know it would happen?
Do you want me to tell you what it was like, reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing Mecca?
`The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.'  I'm telling you as a friend.
Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we really mean it. But where does he live?
Paisley Porter.
I think you're a little confused. Nothing personal friend.
She died.
Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
I'm proud of this play. It's so different from anything you've done.
Because we're completely mismatched.
Do you want to get some coffee?
She is kicking you out.
Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.
We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.
I'd forgotten that.
I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.
Be open with me. I'd like that.
It violates so many trusts.
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
All the failures, all the fatalism.
I'm at the door.
Go way. I'll call a cop.
You'll need these. Tonight. For the play.
Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
I can't find it.
`Why doesn't he come live with us?' Because everything is here.
You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.
You see what you're doing, don't you?
What am I doing?
You're charming the boy.
All the times I died when the Red Sox lost an important game they should have won. All the awful things I said to my mother and father. To Tmy wife and daughter.
I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler?
Have to hurry back.
Yes.
So do I. Over and over.
Is what true?
Do you think he can do it?
He's a very sweet man.
Yes.
I haven't come to you.
Sora was sent to tell me I -- I must rake and cover the latrine.
Everyone takes his turn.
I am your wife.
What do you expect when you talk like that?
Not quite. They're only "holding me" until the Magistrate's hearing. Then it will be prison.
I'm sure your legs are quite as handsome as mine.
How does a reporter in Central America learn that Gandhi was born in Porbandar anyway?
You mean Gandhi?
They are only clinging to old dreams  and trying to split us in the old way. But the will has gone -- Independence will drop like a ripe apple. The only question is when  and how.
The fools!  Sorry...
If we hold firm, it won't be the last.
Mr. Gandhi, I've more or less decided to ask the House to repeal the Act that you have taken such "exception" to.
Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.
Good. Good.  I have thought of calling for a Royal Commission to "investigate" the new legislation.  I think I could guarantee they would recommend the Act be repealed.
Assuming we are in agreement?
All right. Fine.
Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far as you can go.
I guess I'm a slow learner.
--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
I don't like anybody <i>this</i> unlucky.  Widen the sweep.  The West side.  Draw a five mile radius around Gattaca.  Hoover some of the classier establishments.  Random car stops.
He's not here.  It's a blind alley.
Positive saliva match.  The cup was definitely used since the original sweep.
It's not <i>exactly</i> him.
We believe we have a suspect.
That's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.
Six one.
What's wrong with it?
Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
What about this?
What about you?  What's in this for you, Eugene?
Who died?
And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
How long do you stay up there before you go?
Any particular reason?
What are you talking about?
I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
I don't feel too good.  I think I'm still drunk from last night.
Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.
Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself.
By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, "How are you?"  Forty-five minutes later I reply, "Not bad.  How are you?"
How would you like to be yourself for the day?
Not bad, Jerome.
Why have you done this?
In case you get back before I do.
German, is that you?
I'd have to bleach my hair.
Hugo!  I've found him!
Were <i>you</i> alone?
It's here.  My heart.  I'm careful--weekly check-ups.  I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet--  I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.
Who are they?
I'm not doing it.
All it takes is a long arm.
Don't think too badly of her... After all, you were in jail a long time and she is a healthy young woman.
Hello, Doc.
I'm sorry I was late... I got my hair done... the girl was slow.
It doesn't look like that.
What do you mean? You've never been there.
That's not all of it.
After four years and now the question comes up.
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
Usually on the right side as you go in.
At least you were outside.
I know you do. But it is different.  It's different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.
Yeah.
What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore?
How long ago.
There may be a hunting party.
When are you going to learn?
Look, what you said yesterday... I guess that was right. It isn't worth anything if we don't make it together.
We got this far.
We've got some food coming, should be here any minute.
Three years ago I dynamited some fish at the reservoir.
Suit yourself.
What about the vault?
Wire pull over?
I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
Then you do it.
How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
Well, I paid a hell of a price. Now for God's sake keep your mouth shut.
I don't think you have to worry much about Harold. He won't do anything.
How long have you been married?
What's the damage?
Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
I didn't know who Doreen was. Thought she was just another bird.
A couple of weeks back.
Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen.
Do you want to be dead, Albert?
A new venture of mine. It's going to be a restaurant.  Do you like it?
That's not good enough.
Confidential, like.
Once a week you like a gentleman?
What?
Oh yes. When he came up on business.
Yes, while he was here.
Could you do me a favour?
No. I didn't know that.
So where are we going, Princess?
Shouldn't think so.
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
Let her go. She'll be OK.  Sorry about that.
No. It's all right.
How's school?
I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work.  He was always on time.
I mean, what for?
All right. All right. I want to square things with you first.
It's not like that, luv.
Is he staying the night?
Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
You're lucky. They kill as well.
What you going to do?
You're a bastard.
Are you awake?
Are you tired?
They're friends of mine.
Meaning what?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Very...  So, who you working for these days Eric?
Oh, you've been watching television.
So you're doing all right then, Eric. You're making good.
Still got a sense of humour?
Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls together, is it?
No? Funny that. Neither did I.
If I'd known, I'd have fixed him up with something better.
That's right, Harry.
Three hundred altogether?
Four hundred?
I'd never try to sell an Indian.
Mmm...
You had one you'd know it.  Patel. They keep coming up.  I don't know. They like to talk to salesmen.  They're lonely, something.  They like to feel superior, I don't know.  Never bought a fucking thing. You're sitting down "The Rio Rancho this, the blah blah blah," "The Mountain View--" "Oh yes.  My brother told me that..." They got a grapevine.  Fuckin' Indians, George. Not my cup of tea.  Speaking of which I want to tell you something:  I never got a cup of tea with them. You see them in the restaurants.  A supercilious race.  What is this look on their face all the time?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Their broads all look like they just got fucked with a dead cat, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't like it. Christ...
The whole fuckin' thing...The pressure's just too great.  You're ab...you're absolu...they're too important.  All of them.  You go in the door.  I..."I got to close this fucker, or I don't eat lunch," "or I don't win the Cadillac..." We fuckin' work too hard.  You work too hard.  We all, I remember when we were at Platt...huh?  Glen Ross Farms... didn't we sell a bunch of that..."
And now...
I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years.
No.  That's absolutely right.
...sales promotion, "You lose, then we fire your..." No.  It's medieval... it's wrong. "Or we're going to fire your ass." It's wrong.
Yes.
Huh.
You fucking build it!  Men come...
Somebody...
Should do something to them.
Someone should rob the office.
That's right.  It's a crime.  It is a crime.  It's also very safe.
Did I say that?
Is that what I said?
Is that what I said?
It's not something for nothing, George, I took you in on this, you have to go.  That's your thing. I've made the deal with Graff.  I can't go.  I can't go in, I've spoken on this too much.  I've got a big mouth.  "The fucking leads" et cetera, blah blah blah "...the fucking tight ass company..."
Oh, yes, George.
Me?
In the abstract...
Yes.  They are old.
They're ancient.
Clear...
It is dead.
They stole...
What.  What kind of outfit are we running where...where anyone...
Yeah.
Did they...?
Read it.  Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.  What happened here?
You...
...how can you talk to me that... that...
Oh, fuck.  Fuck.  FUCK FUCK FUCK!  WILLIAMSON!!! WILLIAMSON!!!  OPEN THE FUCKING...WILLIAMSON...
I'm going to have your job, shithead. I'm going downtown and talk to Mitch and Murrray, and I'm going to Lemkin.  I don't care whose nephew you are, who you know, whose dick you're sucking on.  You're going out, I swear to you, you're going...
Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say...
...you want to see the court records?  John?  Eh?  You want to go down...
Not lately it isn't.
That's fucked.  That's fucked.  You don't look at the fucking percentage. You look at the gross.
I've seen those leads.  I saw them when I was at Homestead, we pitched those cocksuckers Rio Rancho nineteen sixty-nine they wouldn't buy.  They couldn't buy a fucking toaster.  They're broke, John. They're cold.  They're deadbeats, you can't judge on that.  Even so. Even so.  Alright.  Fine.  Fine. Even so.  I go in, FOUR FUCKING LEADS they got their money in a sock.  They're fucking Polacks, John.  Four leads.  I close two. Two.  Fifty per...
Alright.
That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I'd like something off the other list.  Which, very least, that I'm entitled to.  If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am.  What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you.
What happened?
Would you?  Would you...?  Or you're gonna what, fire me?
Why I don't...
Well, hadn't it?
Well, I'm saying this, Shel: usually I take the contracts to the bank.  Last night I didn't.  How did you know that?  One night in a year I left a contract on my desk. Nobody knew that but you.  Now how did you know that?  You want to talk to me, you want to talk to someone else...because this is my job.  This is my job on the line, and you are going to talk to me.  Now how did you know that contract was on my desk?
If you tell me where the leads are, I won't turn you in.  If you don't, I am going to tell the cop you stole them, Mitch and Murray will see that you go to jail.  Believe me they will.  Now, what did you do with the leads?  I'm walking in that door--you have five seconds to tell me: or you are going to jail.
I sold them to Jerry Graff.
Abso...
You stick around I'll pull the memo for you.  I'm busy now...
Na, fuck the leads, I'm going home.
Shit.
When?
Fuck you, Dave...
Glad to meet you.
Home cooking...
The monthly interview...?
Twelve-fifteen.
Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta...
Money?  If that's what it signifies to you. Security?  Comfort?  All it is is THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO YOU.  That's all it is.  How are they different?  Some poor newly married guy gets run down by a cab.  Some busboy wins the lottery.  All it is, it's a carnival.  What's special...what draws us?  We're all different.  We're not the same.  We are not the same.  Hmmm.  It's been a long day.  What are you drinking?
It's funny, you know, you get a picture of the Corporation-Type Company Man, all business...this man, no.  We'll go out to his home sometime.  Let's see.  Tomorrow.  No.  Tomorrow, I'm in L.A....Monday...I'll take you to lunch, where would you like to go?
But we have to before Monday.  To get our money ba...
But I'm not counting it.  Wednesday.  Thursday.  Friday.  So it would have elapsed.
If we wait till Mon...
When did you write the check?
What was yesterday?
The check wasn't cashed?
You tell me again.
She told me I have to.
I'm...
What does that mean?
She told me I had to get back the check or call the State's att...
Fuckin' cop's got no right talk to me that way.  I didn't rob the place...
Guess who?
You just this morning...
Is that what I did?  Dave?  I humiliated you?  My God...I'm sorry...
I'll show you how to chew it." Your pal closes, all that comes out of your mouth is bile, how fucked up you are...
They got, listen to me...
Yes.
Then I'm over the fucking top and you owe me a Cadillac.
Aren't you going out today?
Are you alright?
Yes.
We have no money for a rug.
Who is the greatest man you can think of?
What took so long?
Well, thank you, they asked for you all week.
It means we should all live happily for one hundred years.  The family. If my Father were alive, it'd be true.
Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice people here.  Friends of Kay's. He'll never forgive me if you ruin his party.
I wanta dance...whatsa matter with that?
Would you like some?
Now what is this talk about joining the army?  Eh?
He will grow strong.
You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner.  Don't be afraid to tell them.  Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things.  Let yourself be guided by him.  He has more experience in these matters.
I think there's only two hundred dollars under my hat.  I'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.
Get a good night's sleep.  We got a new suit, new shirt, new tie, and I'm going to shave you myself. Tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow Americans.
My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.
Gee, Frankie, it's good to see you. Reminds me of old times.
Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.
It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
What's that?
It was never Pentangeli... I've always known that.  It was Roth all along.  He talks to me as a son; as his successor, but the old man thinks he'll live forever.
To go tonight, with me, as though we know nothing.  I've already made my move.
I know what you are thinking, Vitone, but you don't understand yet how things are.  Fanucci is of the Black Hand.  Everyone in the neighborhood pays him, even my father.
Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad.
It's Michael's request...for your safety.  We can send out for anything you need.
I'm going to see my parents.
Where's my wife?
He doesn't want my help any more. He doesn't need it.
Do you think they have somebody to back up Cicci?
Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a stroke but he's recovered okay. Bussetta's dead.
How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?
Good.  Then you're staying.
No questions.
Everything is going to be okay, Frankie, don't worry.
Did my brother go back?
Yeah, but don't worry.
You're right.
Yeah, I still read a lot.  They bring me stuff.
Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.
This meeting is adjourned.
Yes.
Where?
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.  I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it.
Kay, I told you...
I won't let you leave!  Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave.
Are you Klingman?
You talk about the baby.  She can have another baby.
We do favors for each other...
The money was sent.
I wouldn't consider anyone else.
Still no word of your courier? We'll find him.  But at least this will satisfy our friends here. You've been invited to the New Year reception at the Presidential Home. I understand your brother is here as well; I hope he'll come.
Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth. Welcome to the Capri; my brother's upstairs.  You wanta take a rest before you see him, or can I get you something, anything at all?
Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched.
Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.
They feel cheated.
The Rosatos are running crazy; taking hostages, spitting in my face, because they're backed by the Jew in Miami.
Michael, yes, we was all relieved...
I know.
You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.
He supports me.
Yes.
How long you worked for Mr. Whale?
You ever been married, Hanna?
You're sure of that?
Mornin'.
My name is Whale.  This is my house.
I was just about to ask Hanna to bring down iced tea.  I'd like it very much if you'd join me.
They were familiar when I painted them.  That one's copied from a Dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago.  And that's a Rembrandt.
When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you.  Please, Mr. Boone.  Help yourself.
Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
So you had a wife?
What about your stint in Korea? I'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes.
No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.
You asked me to model.  Remember?
Good afternoon, Clayton.
If that's okay?
I better get you home before you catch your death from pneumonia.
You're much wider than I am.  You won't want to attempt to get into my pants.
Is that --?
-- that I was a Marine.  Which is true.  You filled in the rest.
What was that?
When you die...be sure your brain is the last organ to fizzle --
You'll feel better tomorrow.
Hey, Boone.
Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again?
Yes, yes, Dr. Payne.  But from the neck up?  What's my story there?
So what do I do?
Bring a mirror.  Let the Bride feast upon her visage.
And you said there'd be some of me left.  Nobody's going to know me in this getup.
I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago. She said you'd been under the weather.
Hanna?  Who's the new yardman?
There is iced tea, Hanna?  Cucumber sandwiches?
You remember what the doctor tells us.
Who was that at the door?
Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend.
Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made twenty pictures in all --
Quite.
Can we talk about the horror movies now?
Oh my God.  What's wrong, Mr. Whale?  Is it your heart?
Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale.
Six years ...
A boost. A big boost ...
Who was the job for?
What do you mean -- ?
How is he?
You have my word...
I'll catch you later, Randall --
How'd it go?
Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time ...
How's it going -- ?
That's a good one, Donny...
What are you doing back?
I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ...
He doesn't return my calls. or my letters ...
No...
I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -
Hey, you want something to eat ?
What happened to you?
"Over--"  You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--
Hey, now -
You?
I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...
"Shadow games?"
What era was that -- ?
Having fun, Kip?
What did I tell you? What? What did I tell you?
Come here -
What?
You boost her -- ?
Sure, man --
Where we going -- ?
Call 911 -
See you're still stealing the sailors from the sea --
You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's?
On account of Mitch?
No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
What the hell are you doing -- ?
Slip it in ...
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
I bet you say that to all the girls...
With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ...
How is he -- ?
Am I dying? Are all the angels of my life returning to bid a final farewell?  And have my angels completely lost their fashion sense -- ?
You think it can be done?
It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew...
You need him...
Hey, Memphis. Remember me? Toby Walker. I live next door ...
The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
Not really -
Why you gotta front me like that? I'm talking to Kip --
Look at Jeannie's kid.
But he was always a bad kid, that one.
Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.
Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.
I don't want any more of that Shit.
I'm not going to get fucked like Gribbs. He's seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison.  I don't need that. I don't care who it is. I'm warning everybody. Gribbs got twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking around selling junk behind his back. That's not going to happen to me.  You understand?
And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
Paulie.  You're all I got.  I need help.
Talk? To you? After what you did!
I thought you were supposed to turn yourself in at ten o'clock this morning?
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.
I don't want to hear about her anymore.
With what?
Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.
Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. I was depending on that money.
Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it?
we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.
Watch this.
Yeah.
What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.
I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.
You gotta help me. Okay? This girl I told you about? Diana? She's from the Five Towns. She's Jewish. She won't go out with me alone. Can you believe this shit? She's fucking prejudiced, but she's built. She's never been out with an Italian before. She says she'll only go out on a double date with her girlfriend.  You believe this shit? But you gotta see her. I mean, she's beautiful.
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
Don't start. I told you to clean up. Look at this place. It's a pigpen. Look around here. Why do you think I bought you the dishwasher? Look. Look at this.  There's enough powder around here to put us all away.
It's okay. I'll make it up.  I promise. Just hurry it up a little. Okay?
How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?
He says he's too hot.  He doesn't even know I came here today.  It's like he's crazy. Jimmy.
But I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of things. Paulie.  You know me all my life.  I've always done the right thing.
Someday they'll get what's coming to them. That's the only way they'll stop.
Two weeks? That's nothin'. My Uncle Marty? Will knows him. That guy fuckin' drinks like you've never seen! One night he was drivin' back to his house on I-93-- Statie pulls him over.
Oh shit.
--Yah, restructurin' the amount of retards they had workin' for them.
All right, then.
Are they hookin' you up with a job?
It's a way outta here.
Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have.
Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty and I'll still be doin' this. And that's all right 'cause I'm gonna make a run at it. But you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause I'd do anything to have what you got! And so would any of these guys. It'd be a fuckin' insult to us if you're still here in twenty years.
You're kiddin' me.
Hi.
Fuck this, let's get something to eat...
My uncle can probably get you on my demo team.
Chuck, let's go.
What's up guys?
Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before.
Will, our offer starts you at eighty- four thousand a year, plus benefits.
Well, you'd be working on the cutting edge. You'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it. Super string theory, Chaos Math, Advanced algorithms--
Somethin's in my room.
Fuck do you want?
What's that?
This is correct. I see you used Mclullen here--
It's right.  Take it home with you.
Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?
--Maybe I don't want to spend my life sittin' around and explaining shit to people.
The least you can do is show me a little appreciation.
I can come back.
You know, you're no longer required to come here.
Yes.
Excuse me, Timmy. Could you help us? We're trying to settle a bet.
So who won the bet?
Hello.
Good to see you.
Since Nancy died.
And he mailed it to Hardy--
To show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
We haven't really gotten into it. LAMBEAU Maybe you should. My phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers.
Now wait a minute, Gerry--
--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants.
--And here I am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake--
--And why does he hang out with his friends? Because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to. It's called loyalty!
Come in.
Tell me what you really think.
No.
I don't know.
Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
I gave that up when my wife got sick.
I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.
Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon?
That's right.
Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.
If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time.
Look, a lot of that stuff goes back a long way.  And it's between me and him and it has nothing to do with you.
Oh, this is your file. I have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation.
Oh, I know.
Don't fuck with me.
Which one did you take, Will?
I've been sitting over there for forty- five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me. But I'm just tired now and I have to go home and I wasn't going to keep sitting there waiting for you.
I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...
Five minutes.
See, it's my life story. Five more minutes and I would have got to hear your best pick-up line.
Yeah?
Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels.
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
No I haven't...
You grew up around here?
'Course I do, they're my brothers.
You were busy? You know, I really was waiting for you to call me.
You men are shameful. If you're not thinking of your weiner then you're acting on its behalf.
No.
C'mon, give me a peek and we'll go to the battin' cages.
All right, Mr. Nosey Parker. Let me ask you a question? Do you have a photographic memory?
I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart.
Why not?
What am I scared of?
At least you have a mother.
I'm not honest?
What, you want to come in here and save me? Is that what you want to do? Do I have a sign that says "save me" on my back?
Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' bullshit me!
All right, mister. I'll go. You just show your license to contrack, an' then you make out a order--where an' when an' how much you gonna pay--an' you sign it an' we'll go.
Twicet now I've fell for that line. Maybe he needs a thousan' men. So he get's five thousan' there, an' he'll pay fifteen cents a hour. An' you guys'll have to take it 'cause you'll be hungry.  'F he wants to hire men, let him write it out an' say what he's gonna pay. Ast to see his license. He ain't allowed by law to contrack men without a license.
I'd come back--
Well, you said anybody can waltz... How'm *I* doin'?
You're *ticklin' me!*
Any gas?
Short fella. Pale face.
I didn't see nothin'.
Kinda pie y'got?
Sure, but what is this?
Deputy sheriffs.
Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.
No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin' kind of excited about it, too. Which way you going?
Maybe Ma'll have pork for supper. I ain't had pork but four times in four years--every Christmas.
You're right!
What's the matter?
I don't like nobody drawin' a bead on me.
Been doin' a job?
Workin'. Pickin' peaches. But I seen a bunch a fellas yellin' when we come in, so I come out to see what's goin' on. What's it all about?
Didn' you have no breakfast?
Where you going?
Thought I'd take a walk. Any law against it?
Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today.
I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry.
Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't scairt so much. It's just waitin' an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens that I got to do sump'n--  --I'll do it.
Ma...  Ma, I--I can't go to the dance. I jus' can't Ma. I can't hardly stan' it, with Connie not here--an' me this way.
An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
Ma, they comes a time when a man gets mad.
I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am.
That ain't the way they're tellin' it. They're sayin' you done it fust.
It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you.
They was some cops here, Ma. They was takin' down the license numbers. It looks like somebody knows sump'n.
Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.  Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off.
Listen!  That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.
Either we got to tie him up and *throw* him on the truck, or somepin. He can't stay here.
She's jus' wore out, that's all.
Just in case. Sit up back an' if anybody tries to climb up--let 'im have it.
Whatta you think you're talkin' about? I got a han'bill here says good wages, an' I seen it in the papers they need pickers!
Cut it out, Pa. He'p Al with the truck.  Don't fret, honey. You goin' to be awright.
This here's the desert an' we're right in it!
Lemme go! I didn't go to do it!
You don't...
It's what I do.
I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
What?
I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.
--and I guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... I suppose the most important thing, really. I don't know. Anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. It's my shrink, really.
It's always the little things.
I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.
Yes.
As long as I get the laugh.
Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
You don't get to have me. You are a monster, I'm a human being. We're not going to mate.
Shouldn't you be taking notes?
Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be "withholding"... and I know where you live.
Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.
Like a union?
Hard to get good help these days.
Hello Martin. How have you been?
Hello, Bob.
I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer.
He's falling for her. Look at him.
...Tell them that's not my problem. I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.
I'm not happy.
They were very upset.
And sir, I also get that broken- mirror, black-cat, Friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about this one....
Enough?
They told me you're taking lithium, mom.
No, I don't have one.
I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
God it's great to see you.
Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
That's too bad.
I have to get my head back into my work.
When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.
Good evening, Mr. Newberry.
How are you? How's business?
Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong.
How's that?
I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
Why not?
Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner...
I, I don't mean to sound insensitive. I understand your situation. But there's nothing I can do. You just called the wrong person, that's all. I hear there are a bunch of therapists in New York. Maybe you should call one of them.
When I work with a horse, it's no good just me doing it. It doesn't work that way. The owner needs to be involved too.
So how was your first and last day of branding?
That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me.
Well, maybe I am laughing a bit... I just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little.
Does Chicago count?
Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.
Enjoy the day.
The answer's no.
You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...
Thanks.
Now, listen. I want you to stand on him.
I won't apologize for this. And I won't hide it. Not for anybody.
I don't care! We'd be together.
I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India.
I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
Mom?
Fine!
You should call your dad before it gets too late.
Did he tell you that?
Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
WHAT?! How can you --  I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.
I don't deserve that. I have never looked at you as a disappointment. If I'm on your back to do better, if I push you to try harder it's because I want you to be the best you can be.
Why should they?
Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye.
Great!
I should be in by two.
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
No, let me go.
I don't understand. You just said he said no.
NO! What are you -- you're serious about this?
Why?!
And you think it's best if I don't come.
I miss you, Annie.
Well, uh the real reason I called, actually, was to tell you I saw Lucy at Jo-Jo's tonight and she seems very worried.
Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"?
Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner?
Where does this go, Diane?
She calls him Tommy...
But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. It's like going back in time.  I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and I felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. Ha, I never realized how hard it was to describe.
Must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work, huh?
Delayed shock. Or maybe not. I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... Just not sure if I want to.
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
Maybe we should give him another sedative.
Of course not.
They don't get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow. And they're good mother.
Don't you go to school?
You wouldn't want to dance with me, would you?
Just follow this. Nothing to it. I'm going to shut my eyes here for a little while. Just keep going till you run out of road.
Do you want to go around by the old road?
Don't be such a baby!
We still have a way to go.
In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
Let's keep her.
Hackers of the World, Unite!
I can't. Everybody who touches that thing gets busted, I can't afford to get arrested, I'm sorry.
Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your place tonight?
Very impressive.
Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!
Well, I got a lot, alright? I don't know how many but... my head hurts.
Who's that?
Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
Loser.  I can't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus. Dade, I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us, there's no such thing as family and friends. We're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty with you.
The girl. The girl has the disc I need.
Crash Override.
How did you know that?
They'll trace you like that  man, cops are gonna find you, they're gonna find you with a smoking gun.
Fucked if I care, man.
What?
What the hell are you doing?
Name your stakes.
Your slave?
Make it our first date.
Kate, listen.
Uh, hold on...
I'll make it up to you!
Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the principal's office.
It got you seven years probation. No computer, couldn't even use a touch tone phone.
We caught 'em.
There's a new virus in the database.
The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
What is he doing in here?
You think they're going to bust us?
What?
Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...
A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.
Are you two okay?
Michael Myers.
Brady!
Brady! Come with us.
When did this happen?
Hang on Mrs. Pierce.  Not that tie, on the other side.  That's not the only thing your eating Rachel.
Honey, I don't think their home.
How do you know their not?
How many people in the bus?
Night Doc.
Okay everybody, listen up. I've got Rachel Corruthers and her sister in the truck, and I'm taking them outta town route 410. State police are on the way. Got that?
Kido. It's four in the morning.
I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
Rachel, can I go get my costume on?
Coming.
Dad, what's going on?
I didn't know you and Brady had anything okay?
You remember Lindsay don't you?
I don't want to look pushy.
You won't come on too strong.
The state police won't know how to stop him.
Its true, Sheriff.
When he makes that call.
Car trouble?
Sheriff, what is going on out there?
It's been totally charted.
Well, are we still on for tonight?
Saving the treats for Bob?
I have a place for that.
Why did you hang up on me?
Of course.
What's this big, big news?
What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
I can't.
Yes, you can.
I don't want to.
Yeah.
My parents won't be back till ten.
Will you call me tomorrow?
Come on... A skunk could have killed it...
I suppose I do seem a bit sinister for a doctor.
Where?
They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
Sure.
Can we watch the monster movies?
I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.
I don't like that story.
Laurie...
After the movie.
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
Promise?
I promise.
I'm scared!
I'm not responsible, Sam.
I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
Only minimum security.
I see.
The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on...
Shouldn't we pick him up?
Uh, who gets dropped first?
I know.  It's terrible!
Oh, geez, yeah.
Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  I didn't know what to say.
And you, you-you're going?
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
Is this your first job?
Oh, it's just so romantic.  I just want to put on a long gown...
Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
Frederick's done this whole new series that I'm sure you would really love.
Ed Smythe, yes.
Really?  So, so, what else?  Wh- what are you up to?
Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
Ohhhh!
Oh, yes!  You live near here, don't you?
Unless, of course, if-if you had some time, I mean, we could get some coffee.
Well, sure.
I was looking for you.
O-o-o-okay, Lee.  Okay, okay.  You, you, y-you've said enough.  It's my responsibility now.  I will work things out.
Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
I thought you weren't coming.
Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you.  I-I-I want to do things for you.  Hannah doesn't need me as much.  I'm being presumptuous.  Not that you need me.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.
They're fantastic.
Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured.  A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut.  I-it's all very...preconceived.
I didn't say that.
Are you?
I'm not accusing.  I'm asking.  Do you...do you find me too...too giving?  Too-too-too competent?  Too-too, I don't know, disgustingly perfect or something?
Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back?  Do you?  You must.  They- they seem to know so much about us.
Hi, Mom.  How you doing?  Here, let me get you some coffee.  That's enough of that.  What triggered it?
Are you sure?
Hmm?
Elliot lusts after you.
You know, you've been very nervous lately.
I can't take this anymore.
I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.
I think they're fantastic.
Do you miss Frederick?
I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...
Oh, now-- 
Oh!
Ohh!
Come on!  Hurry up!  Let's go!
This is the second opinion.
How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?
I want to experience childbirth.
Here, Mom.  Drink this.  You know, you're awful.  You probably were flirting.
Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.
What?  You're kidding!
Hannah, I have to borrow some more money.  Don't get upset.
Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around.
He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
Not this Thanksgiving, you know.
Sometimes she's terrific...
I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical.  Of course, I'll never get it.
Really?
Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...
Ohh!
Oh, God...
You're crazy!  That's not true.
I can't hear you.  I can't hear anything.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna lose hearing in my ear!  I'm--
Don't, no, please.  Will you-- No, don't...
This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
I was walking past and I saw you in here...
Yeah.
Oh, no.
Oh, nothing much.  You know...
Nobody ever said it.
Oh, I'm fine.
What...what about your script?  So what's it about?
Really?
Oh, who cares?
Hi.
Boy...Holly...Holly.
Why are you so upset?
Well, I was born Jewish, you know, but, uh, but last winter I tried to become a Catholic and...it didn't work for me.  I-I studied and I tried and I gave it everything, but, you know, Catholicism for me was die now, pay later, you know. And I just couldn't get with it. And I, and I wanted to, you know. I--
Take our literature...
Well.  Word gets around.
We got a bunch of <u>materials</u>, coming up at auction.  Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he made, his <u>books</u>.
...aren't you afraid of me...?
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do."  Aren't you part of them anymore...?  Aren't you part of the FBI? 'No Girl's Allowed,' or <u>what</u>?  Have you transgressed...?
You want to get married...?
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.
What else did I miss...?
Impossible.
...WHY DID HE COME BACK?  WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...?
Somewhere in Italy.
...thank you...  And how are you this evening, Doctor? No, we know that you're awake...
..It won't be long now, sir...
....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
No, I think he proffers to spend his happy hours with his playmates.
...here's to child abuse!
I can make you rich.
For a consideration.
Sir:
...what'm I looking at...?
A fellow with five fingers.
...standard issue...
Am I on that case, sir...? 
Your girl's a menace.  Here, givver <u>this</u>... Getter off the street and teach her some <u>humility</u>. 
I'm an orphan.
Sadly, no.  And I find that birth is one of the few things in life which study and a pleasant attitude can not amend. What do you think?
...should love to correct your error. 
How wonderful of you, to hold that information in your <u>busy</u> mind...
...yes.
It is only temporary, until my confirmation by...
And you have a new wedding ring on yours? <u>La Vita Nuova</u>?-- 
Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. Is it hard?  Must one, then, be constantly suspicious?
My scar is a war-wound.
You resemble a figure from the Della Robia Rondels, in your family's chapel at Santa Croce.
Darling...
...long overdue.
...and Shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.
No, I don't get you...
<u>Perhaps</u>... shall we <u>see</u>...?
...and my need for The Institution...
...might I make a suggestion...?
What's that, Baby?
I guess the only thing is Suck it Up...
I'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet.
My daddy would say:  accept with glee the things you cannot change.
What was it.  What was it, honey?
Then we cannot go.
I know something no one knows.  He has had his finger removed.  On his left hand.  It left a scar. 
What shape is the scar?
Hey, lost again.
The great and <u>beautiful</u>...
No,I get it, this is my <u>Cavalier</u>.  This gents my Italian Knight.  Take <u>this</u>...  For this shall be my gage, and you can take it into battle.
...but:  this particular statue...
She must be something special After Dark.
Tell me why...?
....that's right.
You said:  that you have "decided." That your... your feelings of persecution, as you put it are a "self- indulgence," and you are going to put them aside.  And get on with your job.
What is your point?
That if <u>decision</u> were a useful tool, you wouldn't <u>be</u> here.  Why are you here...?
No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
No really, keep talking, I ree-ally want to hear what you have to say, you're just so eloquent...
You think you're so...but you're just...
Summer would have been a lot less without you. You're a true friend, Donald.
She's still pissed at me and took it out on you. We should have taken it slower. It's hard to operate in the woods. Much easier in, like a club.  Tell the girl you've got to go do something, leave her view, take way too long until she is worried that you're not coming back. Just as she starts feeling awful, you come up from behind and touch her neck...
I'm in the picture on Wendy's wall. Niagara Falls. Family trip. Little Wendy foreground. Me background. What are the odds on that one?
Eavesdropping, eh?  Hear anything good?
Am-ber!  Uh...don't do that.
Yeah, an insane female gynecologist! Hayley, don't listen to her.
I didn't realize I had to declare a major.
...and it hurts too much to keep these feelings inside me any longer...
When were you in Niagara Falls?
I love you. Don't say I love you, too. I hate that--"love you, too."
No, not at all. BRAD You're pretty enough to be one.
Gee, thanks.
All right.
We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
Veronica. And Jesse James. Quelle surprise. Hear about Veronica's affection for regurgitation?
I think you can. In Catcher in the Rye Holden says his ideal job'd be making sure some kids don't fall off a cliff. He doesn't realize if you pay too much attention to the kids, you'll back off the cliff yourself.
Yeah, you know Holden Caulfield in the Catcher in the Rye wouldn't put up with their bogus nonsense.
Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on.
Veronica, you look like hell.
What are you doing?
Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food.
Probably....
Just a humble perk from my Dad's Construction company or should I say Deconstruction company?
Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.
Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe we could cough a phlegm globber in it or something.
Something tells me you picked up the wrong cup.
No shit, sherlock. I can't believe it. I just killed my best friend.
Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.
"You might think what I've done is shocking..."
Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.
Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....
You believed it because you wanted to believe it. Your true feelings were too gross and icky for you to face.
I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils?
Tomorrow someone else will move into her place. That person could be me.  Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think I'm doing another suicide note.
It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.
I thought I...you..
Veronica is into his act. No doubt.
You going to eat this?
Hey kid, isn't the prom coming up?
I guess.
How was the funeral?
Everybody cares for youth but nobody cares about Joey Blow. When that news reporter gets home he'll scream at his son for not mowing the lawn in the right pattern.
Veronica! J.D. told me you committed suicide last night!
But my name's not...
Mummy has a special technique called "Deep Therapy."
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.
hurries over.
That's coming along well!
I'm saving them for a rainy day.
gives her a sympathetic look.
They sent me off to the Bahamas "for the good of my health." They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands "for the good of my health."
looks startled at the outburst.
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
I think I'm dying . . .
I wish James would do a religious picture . . . he'd be perfect as Jesus!
You're such an incredible woman.
What??
I'm sure they'll notice things missing.
But that's not true! I've got one.
Allison? Why can't remember what happened to my wife? Is it something I'm on that's... that's making me forget?
Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on.
Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
We startred off to be. She was, I guess I was. I just sort of....butchered up the relationship somehow.  Bad choice of words.
I understand, I think. Other women?
No. But at one point you did repeat something though. A phrase. You must have been having this recurring dream, you just kept saying this one thing over and over
Give me a break. I checked back into the hospital- amongst other things.
The boss won't notice me doing a bad job because I'm not. Even if the boss thought I was slacking I'd know right away.
Really? Do tell.
Hello I'm Dr...
Please, Gwen. You're- you're all over me.
Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.
Never to put you in my will.
Kirsty... Kirsty?
What happens if I'm convicted of Kirsty's murder?
Least let me finish will ya? Got one puff left.
I don't work here.
This game is over do you hear me?
All you've got is the here and the now Trevor. That's all anyone really has. Maybe this will make things easier to understand. A man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man. And at the end of the day does it even matter? All these events you're describing. How can you be sure any of them really happened?
-Tawny.
Last week...
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!
That's close enough.  It's a confession.  The truth.  Jesus, I'm sorry, LaPlante.  I had the shoe, you said you didn't want, publicity because of your legal problems.
Jail!  Listen, Bubber...  This is crazy.  We could fall off of here.
It was you!  I thought I heard...
Bernie.  Call me Bernie.
You'll tell him I talked you out of jumping, right?  Just keep me outta prison.
We can hope.  You still have your job, right?
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..
My attorney, she's just outta law school, about a couple of years older than my kid, for Chrissake.
What wouldja say if I toldja I ran into a burning plane an' saved a buncha people, Chick, an' risked my goddamnlife?
I wouldn't be depressed about it, Bern.  A guy don't have to be heroic to be a human being.
DON'T SAY "BILL," BERNIE!  DON'T SAY ONE WORD!  DIDN'T I SAY "ONE WORD AND YOU'RE FIRED?"
"Elliot"?  The heroic goddamn fireman?
All this is off the record, Chucky, because if John Bubber lives, Mister LaPlante is going to give him his assurance that there will be no more "misbehavior" on his part.  What's more he's going to apologize.
This guy, this "friend" your mother's seeing, he's a fireman, huh?  He ever... spend the night, whatsisname?
Here.  Get off here.
Yes.
Is she... serious?  A half a million dollars?  In my behalf?
You... you think I saved your... life.  I can't take advantage....
Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...
What's the matter?
She broke up with her boyfriend.  Listen, babe, we needja back. You gotta follow up on the jumper, find the human interest in the grim, unending tale of woe that pours from the wounded heart of the heartless metropolis.
We're piecing together different accounts and...
How'd it go?
Ticket!  What's going on?
She wants to quit?
The Presidency.  The public loves him.
You were in bed.  Weren't you?
What's "cynical"?
Hi, Chief.  You like the suicide?
I didn't say I thought we should have saved him..
Is he like that in real life?  So gorgeous?
Hey, Miss Gayley, there's a cop looking for you.  From Robbery Detail, Inspector Dayton.  He wants you to call him.
What about?
Excuse me, Ms. Gayley.  That guy Inspector Dayton... he's recovered a bunch of your credit cards and he wants...
Okay.
Well, it's for a woman.
Oh, it's nothing.  No problem. I was really lucky to find this place.
Yeah, things are moving along, but she's still involved with this other guy and it's a little tricky.
Oh no -- I mean, she's genuinely made me more fulfilled in many ways -- and I hope eventually to be able to teach her a few things, too.  What I mean is, I guess I'm still waiting for just that right -- synthesis between us -- where everything will be understood between us without even the need for words.
<u>Ask</u> her how she feels.
I should.
There's so much I want to say to her, it's all jumbled up in my mind, and I don't want her to misunderstand --
It's nice that you can make that choice.
I found a cent!
It's the middle of the night, sweetie.
Your daddy and I are kind of mad at each other right now, so we have to spend some time apart.
Uh huh.
And?
I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
He doesn't have a temperature.
But it's what we want.
We're going to think about it.
Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
Honey?  How did it go?  You didn't call me.
Boy, you really buckle under a little pressure, don't you?
Because it caught my eye when it was in a higher price bracket in the listings.
Let's follow 'em.
And this -- is the master bedroom.
They appear to be authentic.
This ties in with Nash.
Lieutenant.
When did you get back?
Around.
No.
Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
The river.
That's all?
Do you not hear the wind in the trees?  The songs of the birds.  The horses breath?  There is a whole world around you. Alive.  Living.  Feel it -- become part of it.  Live your life, Highlander.  It's going to be a long one.
Thank you, Thomas.
How long is the voyage?
You've been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past?
I stood up first.
Your words are kind and they flatter me -- but I think of her as a sister. Besides, you hardly know me.
How comes it your are not afraid?
Why not?
You guys are from the British museum, right?
Yes.  How did you know?
Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
This is.  Go home.  Stay out of this.
Meet me Tratino's at nine.
A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
I've seen it.
You wanted the truth -- now you have it.
Where will you go now?
We're holding the workers down below.
Why?
Jennifer, there is more to life than work.
It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
Highlander -- I had hoped it would be you.
I know.
The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
I'll no forget you.
You kept it?
Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.
I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--
Would you like to deposit this in your account?
I will, Chief.  Absolutely.
Yes, sir.  But what about the disks?  If the cops end up with the disks, we're gonna see a whole lot of heat.
I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.
The car.  All you want is the car?
Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.
Let me come get him.
Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
That's right.  That's a good idea, Mars.
That would be Mars Krupchek.  Jesus, he works for me, too.
What do you mean?
If things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end.
<u>I don't know</u>.  Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out.  He's fucking us over, Glen.  That guy is fucking us over.
I have your fucking family.  Don't forget that.
Fuck that!  You think I'm crazy?!
I need to work out some stuff.
We can't carry him.
I don't drink beer.
You gotta pee?
Dennis and Mars are in the den.  I'll get your brother, then come back for you. We'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand?
That's enough.
I couldn't find Jane.  She wasn't at the restaurant.
Do it.
Sounds like you know the job.
No.  He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.
I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --
Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!
How do you people expect this to work? The Sheriffs have a Crisis Response Team here.
We've got to get those kids out of there!
That's on the second floor.  Could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you?
I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?
Who is it?
Did you find the disks?
Excuse me?
How much?
What's happening?
They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister.
I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
Paul, I need you to buy me a day or two. I don't have the fuel for this convoy. I will have to scrounge it.
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.
A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
Satellites?
The police are very busy.
We must go to the Diplomat.
They can go where they want. They are in charge now.
Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
A bargain buy, from China. Ten cents each, I'll get a dollar.
Holy shit! Holy shit.
Here, have a sandwich.
I don't have to listen to you anymore.
I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.
Please, except my humblest apologies...
Are you sure this is the river road?
Paul, how the hell are ya'?
Give her what she wants, room, food, anything. Charge it all. Don't you put her out, Paul.
Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.
He will be here.
Our cards, please.
Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy.
I couldn't help.
Where are Thomas and Fedens?
They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
How can we help him.
What are you saying, Tatsi?
Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
Go to the roof now.
To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
Why?
I will not leave without the twins.
We have to get out of here Tatiana.
Get on the truck, Tatiana.
Let me go. Children get off.
Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
Where?
Not too big on it myself -- but then again, not on marriage either.
So what stopped her?
More of Price's spook-house bullshit.
Now what do we do? We've got to hold him somewhere 'til the police --
What?
Upstairs, too. Come with me, I'll show you another body, a friend of mine named Schecter --
Yeah, what the hell, I'll go.
'Less the place really is haunted.
I'll meet you down there.
Married. Once. Same woman. All these years. She just slithered up the stairs.
Prove it.
Oh, Jesus....
-- the stained glass --
-- no. The basement -- the room with all the controls to this thing: big long iron levers just lying there --
It's okay, everything's okay now.
I knew this whole place'd be pure gold! Pritchett, point me in the direction of the goddamn ghosts! If I can get something bizarre enough on tape, I think I can parlay it into getting me some kind'a Robert Stack "Unsolved Most- Wacked-Out Home Videos" gig. No more five afternoons a week of sex-change- Nazis-and-the-lesbos-that-love-'em.
Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?
Really? Well, let it rip.
-- the sadistic prick --
If I had one, Evelyn, I think you know who'd be first and last --
I was in the middle of --
No, no, it's just --
Business or pleasure, Mr. Price?
Do something!
-- my loss --
-- then I guess then it had to be you. Sorry.
What're you talking about?
Good way to get your head blown off.
I'll take my chances.
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
Sara...?
We don't have proof of that.
So was I.  The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not.
Are you all right?
It will heal.
I don't understand.
Mommy, the leprechauns drank the milk last night.
Where are we going to go, mommy?
H-how long will it take?
Sure.  Did you see the others?
Look daddy!  It's empty!
Mommy please help me!
What's the matter?
No.  Maybe it was Aubrey.
Well what power lines, Will?  Where?  Maybe we should call someone about it.
Oh come on!
Just because I have an open mind doesn't mean I'm going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo stick around the house.
It just disappeared.  Literally.
What are you talking about?
Do you think I'm a fool?
Thank you.  I believe she would have wanted it.
Now you must listen to me. This force is like a parasite, or a virus. It feeds on doubt, suspicion, discord... you must clear your mind as we reach out for her.
You must be the new tenants.
Thank you.
I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've been here before to cast evil from this house.  The amulet is a guard against evil, blessed in countless rituals.   It is an ancient ceremony of the early Catholic church, a ceremony whose secrets are all but lost.
Better hurry, Doc.  A real story.  With a real reporter.
OK.  Be careful.  And lighten up.  Story of your life could be right round the corner.
He'll do what he does best.  But he'll do it unfettered.  He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering.
So where is it?
Wha .... ?
Uh-huh?
Yeah.  Sure.  You mean ... tonight?
Your dream.  You said you were having a bad dream.
... well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything.  It's ... well, I know what it is.
The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them.
Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.
Would you know this store again?
Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
But you gave me a rose ...
Hey, it has been known.  C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy.  I have regrets. I'd like to put things right.  Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Huh?
Yes. 53
A girl?  Anyone I should know?
No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.
Eighth room down, babe...
I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?
It's Captain Bob's steering wheel! Remember when the Captain.....
"A mule is an animal with long funny ears."
The Butler did it.  Guy was a cross between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart. Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied dumptied it over Gates's head.  He said it was made by, get this, Leonardo..
Boing.  Uh, this I don t understand...
Now that's a lock.
Attempt, you mean.  The vanity of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The Vatican has foiled the advances of Pirates and Terrorists.  We will not lie down for some schmuck from New Jersey.  Must you flirt with him so realistically?
Come on, this stuff will knock you out.  Have you ever had the feeling you were being followed, Mr. Bond.
Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times Square?
Nice.  But right out of our brochure.
And I'll bring my entourage...
And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky I don't hit women, assuming you are a woman.  I'm not taking anything for granted anymore.
Oh Hudson...
I wanna know...
Cat got his tongue?
Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.
Remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself?
You killed a friend.  Why should I help you go for the gold?
Don't be stupid...they...
Don't I know you...
Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another...
It's hardly the same --
Adenoids?
I'm tellin' ya, this guy's just the patsy and I'm gonna find out what for. There's a real story, Smitty, some kind of plot, a setup, a cabal, a -- oh, and say, did I tell ya?!
Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?
Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --
...You know! For kids!
Confused?
...What happened?
...You do?
Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well no, I -- I never really... There's a place I go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar.
What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?
For Pete's sake, Norville!
Now, Aim --
Now, Amy --
Sez who?
Watch it, Archer --
I want a martini! It's New Year's Eve and I want a Martini!
Yeah, daddy, that's a roger, but we don't sell alcohol.
You know what they're doin' now, Lou.
Awwww, buddy --
...It is?
Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --
But, Buzz --
...Jesus Christopher -- That smarts... Where was I? Oh yeah, the board. I guess Sidney's been puttin' the screws to ya, huh, Norman?
Well, why don't ya read it.
Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.
Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --
I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important!
Tell him I'll be right there...  Well, what is it?
All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
...Congratulations, kid, you've really outdone yourself. Reinvented the wheel. I'm going to recommend to the Board that we proceed immediately with this, uh... with the, uh... that the dingus be mass-produced with all deliberate speed. Of course, as president of the company the ultimate decision is yours.
Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly.
She isn't!
Miss Jessica used to say this is the only way for a lady to break her fast -- in bed, with a lacy cushion to bank her head up. If you'd only seen her, Miss Connell. She looked so pretty.
Alive?
I really intended going out to the Fort and meeting you long before this, Miss Connell.  I'm Mrs. Rand -- Wesley's mother.
I'd love to.
You've never said anything about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand.
Frankly, my dear, I didn't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl.  What are you driving at?
But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
But you didn't have to come up here.
She can never be cured?
I've never heard of a cure.
The West Indies?
Is she a doctor?
Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand.  Those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy. They're jumping in terror.  Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. It's the glitter of putrescence.  There's no beauty here -- it's death and decay.
Can't I take it for you?
If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
I often do.
Well?
Because you wanted to give my wife back to me?  Why should that mean anything to you?
Considering that the paper is three months old and this isn't Sunday -- no thank you.
Investigation of what?
I wasn't star--
Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that "I'm OK. You're OK" stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and --
So early?
Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce?
You crying?
The turkey in?
It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup.
Don't be dim.
Elena, what are you're talking about?
It's a starting place.
In the car.
Well?
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
Yeah?
Maybe it's all for the better, you know? Yesterday, at dinner, well, she hasn't said anything... has she acted funny to you, I mean, have you noticed anything?
Damn right, but where the hell were you?
Fascist!
Talking to me, dad?
Advice? I'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, Ben. Unless - have you quit your job? They fired you?
-- Your mother, God bless her, stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce - I assume you're talking here about divorce? The very thought --
That's besides the point. The point is if I'd had any sense in me I'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that's the truth, and here it is, 1972 --
-- 73
It's not the taxes I object to. It's all the fines and penalties.
Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the IRS, and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff --
Oh. Elena wanted to know when we could expect you on Thanksgiving. It's just going to be you this year.
It's what?
Now don't make me feel as if I'm being too forward, OK? If you don't --
Sure. Maybe coffee.
They need the money for my band uniform at school.
Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt.
Forget what?
In many ways, the church-bound tradition of the father, son, and holy ghost is simply a version of the parent-child-adult triad within us all. It's a primitive set of symbols for our inner psychology.
-- And God the angry parent, and the Spirit the hope of an integrated adult self.
That's right.
Where you going?
Paul, let me enlighten you about something. You and I exist on two opposite sides of a great existential divide, that being your pathetic virginity on the one hand and my astonishing number of sexual conquests on the other. I'm off to get laid. See you.
Come on Paulie, share the wealth. You copped 'em from her mom's stash anyway.
Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed.
Um, Libbets. Hey, Dostoyevsky, I'm also really a fan, and what you were saying, you know, have you ever read The Idiot?
The Idiot?
Well, uh, I don't, it's really --
Yeah.
It's like very positive, and I feel a real special feeling, because you really --
I do.
Yeah?
Want some gum?
Did you tell Sandy?
Wow!
When worlds collide.
Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
I'm sorry if I got you into trouble. Maybe we don't have to, you know... unless you really want to.
How are the parental units functioning these days?
And?
Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.
Well, you can...
What are you doing?
One more shot?
And then I lost him.  In the fog.
Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.
Who's that?
I'll stick it in the evidence locker...
Dormer.  Still no sign of the bullet that went through Farrell.
Where you signed this?
Weston Dobbs killed an eight year-old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat.  You remember that?
I'm thinking I could get off with probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's all I want.
Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
Fred Duggar?
No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
That's not what he thinks.
Will...I...
Huh?
The other guy?
You don't know.
You're not missing much.
It was like some big fucking secret!
Down at the station?
Yes.
Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.
Who made us what we are?
And yet you knew what I would o.
But you're the fairest by far.
I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you.
How did you learn to write, Claudia?
But you never let me see you kill, Louis.
We're immortal. You've always known that.
It can't be -
But this can't be real. This is nonsense.
Never.
But if she dies...
And if I don't?
But we can live without taking human life. It's possible.
They know about us. They see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses.
Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!
I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
Do what it is in your nature to do. And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.
Evil is a point of view. God kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves.
She's here, your wounded one.
You'll come home with me Louis? Fro a little while... until I am myself again.
It's only a siren...
And they frighten you?
You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...
You followed me here, didn't you?
So shall we begin?  What do yo do?
You believe this, don't you? That you're a vampire? You really think...
How did you do that?
How could I not? She had to know.
Peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper.
No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?
And the child who did die?
Listen to me. He's here.
Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.
Stupid. Stupid.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed.
I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
He's not coming. I thought he was just...
I'm the King of the World.
Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here.
I'm fine.
You sure?
I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months.
Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school...  Are you okay?
I'm okay.
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
Julie? What's wrong?
I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
Oooh, the mainland --
Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.
Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.  Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.
Hell, that's worth three, easy. And you got your waiting period.
Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
All the graves?
I hope Mr. Jacks gets to bed in one piece.
Poor Cathy --
It's getting dark. I can't leave now.
Shh it's all right - I'll be all right.
What is it -- what are you talking about?
When I tell him that you're unfit to live a normal life with normal people - a cataleptic!
Woman, what are you doing here?
Theodosia.
She is not there. The coffin is gone.
It doesn't seem to bother you much, General.
There is something evil about her.
She was beautiful. There was blood between her family and my kin. But that did not stop me from taking her when I saw her beauty, nor did it stop her from loving me.
But they're somebody's children.
Mr. Potter, what makes you such a hard-skulled character? You have no family  no children. You can't begin to spend all the money you've got.
Come on, we got to get this up. He's coming.
That's what I was sent down for. I'm your guardian angel.
I told you  I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you.
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
Look, I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here.
Oh, well, I can't . . .
Sit down? What are . . .
If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
What did you stop it for?
Who is it?
Splendid! Is he sick?
You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
Aw, now, doggone it, Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff. You know where I live. Three-twenty Sycamore. Now hurry up.
Of course it's the place.
Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
So long, George. See you in the funny papers.
Oh, stop that grunting.
Hmmm . . .
Hmmm?
And besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York, and you're here in Bedford Falls.
George! George!
Mr. Gower, do you want something . . . Anything?
Yes, sir. They have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir?
George.
No, George, don't . . .
Say hello to New York for me.
Why didn't you call me?
All right. All right. Now we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.
Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
Yes, sir.
No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.
Made up your mind yet?
I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of romance, that old place. I'd like to live in it.
Oh, no.
No, I don't want to be rude.
Oh, Mary . . .
Have fun.
Hi.
You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town.
Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? Look at you.
Huh?
You forgot something.
Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?
Come on, you guys.
Wheee!  Faster!
No.
Who's that?  Quick -- I'm in love.
That's awful.
I don't know.
Good morning!
What camera?
Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
Mike's out there.
See where Cable Junction is?  Look to the left.  The lighthouse.  That's it.
You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.
I'm going.
Don't go out if it's rough or any- thing, huh?  We've had a lot of trouble.
Is Hooper coming to dinner?
Yeah?
Sailing?  Forget it.  You're beached. Grounded.  No more boats.
Look at that:
Come on, let's check the bite radius.
We don't know that, do we?
But that's what we're here to find out, right?
Okay, so that's it.
Sound?
So there's one around here.
Can't you tell?
Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair.  Where were you?
All summer?
We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone.
Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
It's still a good idea.
Thank God you guys were all together. I got something for you.  Proof!
Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer.
Dad!  Dad!
You're not going out right away, are you?
She just likes to tease.  I think she really likes you.
Whoops, almost lost one.  Can't play with the dolphins without skis....
Help!  Help!
Who'd you ask?
You're crazy.  She's Ed's girl friend.
No class.
You want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this?
Mmmmmm.
All of them.  Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all that whole gang.
About damn time.
Too hot tor those two?  I can't believe it.
We'll be over by the lighthouse.
Maybe you and Brooke could come over to the town beach....
That's not it.  My dad told me not to go.
You always go with Andy.
Do I have to play with the little kids?
Larry, I'm a businessman, trying to make a buck like anybody else.
It hasn't adjusted.
With those camera lights and...
You buying?
Well, not much longer to go.
Honey, I gotta go.
How come?
No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
What do I do now?
Take a deep breath and hold it.
Oh, yeah.  Very.
Are you coming...?
You're going down there again?
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
What's that?
Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you.
Change your mind?
They said you'd be here.
What's up?
I need more pressure in the shark tank.
Yes.  It's faster.
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
What do you mean, we don't?
Come on!
Me.
Michael, you don't have to go down there.
You don't have to prove anything.
On the telly.  We're to film him for the evening news.
Could be a new dance...  Walking the Shark.
That's because I am the shark.
Get ready to go.
We can assume he's back in the water intake passage.
A piece of pie on Sunday.
Sean.  Sean, where are you?
Hi, Mike.
How you doing, Kelly?
How long you staying?
How come?
Well, I needed a cold shower.
Isn't this fun!
The space shuttle has landed!
I don't talk that way.
On monitor three.  Was a glimpse of something.
Bring the crane over.  Come down. Easy down.
Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
Got a job for me?
Took it this morning.
He needs a haircut.
He taught us good, though, didn't he, Sean?  We were lucky to grow up the way we did.
Who's grown up?
You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity?
Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas.  In one of those chapels.  He can meet us there.
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
How come it's my responsibility?
What the hell are we arguing about?
Where is she?
How could you do that?  Your own daughter....
That hurt....
You check it....
He heard that.
In a minute....
I never....
I like Grandma's cooking....
No one.  Nothing.  We've got to get this finished before the tide comes in.
Sit down, Ma....
I didn't mean to start that....
All you all right?
I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
I m not unhappy.  Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little.  It'll work out....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
I can't....
I'll get it back next time.
What do you deliver on all those charters you...?
Still chasing fish?
I'll get her.  Have a good Christmas, Matt....
Will you leave me alone...?
You tagging them...?
You didn't stick them on right....
What she's got.  Nine knots....
Maybe he only likes white meat....
Holy Christ....
Wait for the sucker to charge, then hit the switch.  Just like taking a picture.
It's my fault...I have to....
Jake.
Where's Lenny?
You'll never guess. Shut your eyes, Mama. Shut 'em for little Jakie. Ha. I'm gonna steal something.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. I'll give it back to you some day, too, you see if I don't. Mama, darlin', if I'm a success in this show, well, we're gonna move from here. Oh yes, we're gonna move up in the Bronx. A lot of nice green grass up there and a whole lot of people you know. There's the Ginsbergs, the Guttenbergs, and the Goldbergs. Oh, a whole lotta Bergs; I don't know 'em all. And I'm gonna buy you a nice black silk dress, Mama. You see Mrs. Friedman, the butcher's wife, she'll be jealous of you.
Yes, she will. You see if she isn't. And I'm gonna get you a nice pink dress that'll go with your brown eyes.
What? Whatta you mean, no? Who is -- who is telling you? Whatta you mean, no? Yes, you'll wear pink or else. Or else you'll wear pink.  And, darlin', oh, I'm gonna take you to Coney Island.
As I said, Sergeant, you nearly ran into <u>me</u>? What's the problem?
What do you think?
Yeah, he can go ...
What does that mean?
You want my advice?
Because I dislike her too much ..
Pig Woman agreed to take a test.
Where is everyone?
Thank Christ we got a witness.
I haven't got it.
That isn't what you said before.
All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
What if we need a back up?
How do you know her hair's black?
I <u>have</u> heard you. You just don't like hearing <u>me</u>. You got this whole damned thing outta proportion. I don't know what you gotten used to in Los Angeles, but I don't believe there's a Police Chief, <u>in this country</u>, would put a task force together for a body part ..
His blind friend got "attacked." Angelo went up there, and some- how, it got itself in the paper.
Are you wearing a uniform?
I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..
How d'you know what I'm like?
He said that? What else did he say?
You know? How do you know?
I can't identify him ..
I know about alcohol, John.
You don't wanna sit here any more, sweetheart ..
Why?
Two or three years ago.
This can't be happening to me.
It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --
Didn't hear it.
I did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of El Capitan in 6 hours! I can make this work.
You hear those courtesy laughs, Jerry? There is a seething wrongness at the edges of this party.
Airight.  Enough.  I'm pulling him out of this.  This isn't what I had in mind anyway.
So I know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right?
But I mean really... wonderfully...  great.
Honey -- later, okay?  Whoop.  Wait.
Hello?
Better now than later.  We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.
Yeah, I did.
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
You know how much those Well Child exams cost --
I heard.
This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
I've got a 24 hour a day reminder of Roger, for the rest of my life. I have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours I might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath.  Look at me, Laurel, look at me.  I'm the oldest 26 year old in the world!  How do I look?
Because I'm worried that you're putting your faith in this guy who, because of the way things are going, may not have an emotional marble in his head.
Oh, thank you.
I'll give it everything.
Hey, I'm learning as I go.
I got it.
Call me tomorrow.
You love me now, don't you?
Rod --
Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
Oh I know plenty.  I was raised by a single mother.
Then you gotta have The Talk.
You never had The Talk, did you?
Fine.
Jerry!  You made it --
You're with the sports people on the plane, right?
I think you'll know when you see him at the gate.
Which they do.  And we're standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me." And I took out the ring, and I don't much like big scenes, but she said "yes" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies.  We're getting married in February.
Marcee.  How's my favorite player's wife?
Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
Cronin's okay for lunch?
You okay?
Pardon me?
You wanted smaller.
Funny.
Shut up!!!
Sorry.
Nothing.
I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for the things I said about him.
No, it's...
I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.
I don't remember
He could have died.
He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded.
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, thats where he's headed.
Absolutely not.
I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin.
Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
It looks intact.
We could co-write a paper.
It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
I'd better get going.
When I met you, I thought that one day millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me otherwise. When conditions changed, dinosaurs changed. They became other things. They evolved.
In Costa Rica?
No. I couldn't see.
That's hard to believe.
I didn't know you -- weren't well.
That was a pair bond!  A family group, even, long after that infant was nestbound!
Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.
Is that kid still bothering you?
That was about a year ago.
No.  Richard talked to his parents.
I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
Dad!
Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?
Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions.  First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.  Second condition -- my fee.  You can keep it.  All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck only.  Why and how are my business. If you don't  like either of those conditions, you're on your own.  Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care.  But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas.  Okay?
Where do you think you're going?!
What in Christ's name is going on?!
We took to the rock.
There' no reason for name calling.
Come on!
It'll hold!
I think she's with Sarah!
Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.
How many rounds did you find for that weapon?
It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
What?!
-- way we could safely --
Ruining everything, that's what they're doing.  You could choke on the diesel smoke already!
You've got to be kidding.
That storm center hasn't dissipated or changed course. We're going to have to cut the tour short, I'm afraid. Pick it up again tomorrow where we left off.
I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
How many lines of code are there?
Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.
Paleo-DNA?  From what source?  Where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood?!
Yours was fully illustrated, honey.
Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing.  Seems to happen about every six weeks or so.
Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted.
Carousel.
You're absolutely right.  Yes, you're right.  Hiring Nedry was a mistake, that's obvious.  	We're over- dependent on automation, I can see that now.  But that's all correctable for the next time around.
Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.
Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
The what?
The movement!
Ellie, we can tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply, they're totally wrong!  This is a warm-blooded creature.  They're totally wrong.
Oh, shit.
Ellie, I've been thinking there's something about the periodicity doesn't had up.
- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -
You can't hold it by yourself!
The fences are electrified, right?
I can't wait anymore.  Something went wrong.  I'm going to go get the power back on.
It's all right.
When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
- - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -
And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
I threw up.
Yes it is.
You know what this is?  It's a dinosaur egg.  The dinosaurs are breeding.
But - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
You haven't touched  didn't touch anything.  We're stopping.  We've stopped.
I didn't say you were scared.
Hey, we were saving that!
Dad - - Dad - -
Hear that?  Are you hearing this?
It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, Tim.  One, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?
Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!  The power's coming back!
Chain saws.
I don't think the people who live around here would like that very much...
Yeah?
I think we're lost.
You have a map.
Mister Biller... now that we can see the lake, I think we should follow the shoreline to --
Hello?
I don't know...
Janet, are you okay? Are you there?
He... he's here...
Because everyone knows he's guilty...
He wets the bed?
I think I'm onto something, Joe.
Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection.
Not yet.
Then I'd say we should put Jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. We'll get extra data this time. Video... infrared... the works.
Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.
Krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal, like us.
What's that?
Ten CC's of this shit and you won't be dreaming about anything.
We're down to seven minutes.
Are you all right?
I read the one about the penal colony.
-- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family.
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
No, I left it in his office.
Did you see him?
Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing --
But <u>I'm</u> the messenger.  An error like this damages my credibility.
Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
It's what I'm paid to do.
Attitude, Kafka.  It doesn't matter how well you do your work -- you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in.
In a small way.
I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in Accident --
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
I've never seen you here before.
No.
When I have no reason to doubt.
Eduard wanted to marry me.
I nominated you as a possible candidate.  You were Eduard's good friend.  He read me some of your work.
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
I knew you walked this way to work.  I wanted to find you before they did.
I told you, they're <u>dead</u>.  It's finished.
I think you've just escaped for the moment.  Just as I did.  As Eduard did.  As they let us do. But only for the moment.
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
Wednesday.  We left the office together.
-- Accident and Compensation Association.
Well -- other departments are, yes.
Anyway, I'd like you to reflect that in me you have -- I won't say a friend, because we're complete fencers, of course -- from distinctly incompatible social classes -- but to some extent, shall we say, an interested third party.
I'll bear that in mind.
What did she say?
-- I was just trying to finish some work!
I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
... A piece of paper ...
Once a file's been sent to the Caste, is it possible to recall it for review?
What if I petitioned one of the Directors?
Ludwig.
Women are all you have on your mind!
We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
I'm coming onboard! Throw down a ladder!
Out! Out! All of you! We have been issued with an exclusive permit -
God, you're so obnoxious! Our work happens to be of great anthropological value!
There's a light up ahead.
We're leaving.
Oh Jesus ... you took it.
Jack! This is the archeological find of the century!
I'm not sailing with this thing on board!
Look, I've sailed these waters for twenty-seven years ... there's no island like that around here.
Hey! I thought these things were supposed to be extinct!
They were just tasting the berries.
Set up the camera boys! Get a shot of me comin' ashore!
I'm calling a wrap. We're heading back to the ship.
Not young; he wasn't young -- gray at the temples, he -- well actually he looked like you.
Sorry. 
Didn't want you.
What was better? I made better bait?
From the beginning I don't know why the hell he's messin with you. If he was me he'd know better. If he was even a city boy he'd know better. You're a whore Miss Daniel, that's the truth of it, right? Now somethin I'd like you to look at.
Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
Oh no, I don't think --
What about?
Will you let me ask you some questions?
Could I ask some questions?
What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
What're you gonna do next?
What am I supposed to say?
Spangler says we have a relationship.
Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.
Ah, Schmendrick -- what's the scam?
Please. I said I don't want you to do this.
I am.
How can you not think so? You know the things I can do.
Can I carry something for you, to the car?  Will you kiss me?
All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?
I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things.
It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
I can't follow you.
Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street.
Just send me a money order.
Have you discussed this with them?
I've always respected Bree.  I'd like to make something clear.
Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.
Nobody's seen that.
The subject got emotionallv disturbed; he just dropped out. There's thousands.
I'm Dr. Alvarez, Judge Atkins asked me to look in on your son and prepare an evaluation sheet.
Does that distress you?
What about my orange juice?
I'm sorry, pal, but I had a meeting and--
Yeah?
Sure.  Too much birthday cake, right?
You get a new fence.
Je-sus Christ!  I catch all kind of shit at the office because I'm not pulling my weight because I'm busting my butt trying to be a decent goddamn father and--
That's okay.
Then eat around it.
No.
Daddy?
See.  That's my name.
Wow!  That's neat.   Can I sit in it?
Are you going to get remarried?
Daddy!  You're home early.  Did you get fired again?
Why does he decide?
Where will my toys be?
I do not, your honor, however--
This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.
And would you describe those years as happy?
The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.
And what is your present salary?
Now then, Mr. O'Connor, how long did Ted Kramer work for you?
Call up the people at J. Walter Thompson.  Set up an appointment at four.
Would you describe your husband as an alcoholic?
I consider it less my failure than his.
I'm listening, Joanna--believe me, I'm listening.  My wife is walking out on me after eight years of--
I am not!  I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother.  I yell at him all the time.  I have no patience.  No...No.  He's better off without me.  Ted, I've got to go...I've got to go.
I've seen him.
Watching my son...Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.
Joanna, go be a mother.  Get married, have kids.  Don't get married, have kids.  Do whatever you want.  I don't give a damn. Just leave me out of it--and leave my baby out of it.
Okay, I'm here.  Now why did you--
Jim, I've got to go.  I'm already late--
What?
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
Look, she walked out on her own child, right?  That's desertion, right? Mr. Shaunessy, I'm telling you it's an open and shut case.
Oh, Christ!
Ted?  They've set the court date. I just heard today...It's...  January sixth.
You're sure?
Kham, Holiness.
Your people are very brave. They are fighting the Chinese. No one can stop them. Not even me.
And you have horses? You love horses.
Impossible! You will bring famine down on the people of Tibet with these insatiable demands! More food, the best land for your soldiers to camp.
I will not approve it.
General Chiang.
I am afraid.
I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
I miss my brother.
How big is Tibet's army?
Will we be in this war?
Britain?
Good day.
Good day.
I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. Industrial progress. Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous.
Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
Then, I am lucky. I am still too young.
They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.
The Chinese have one goal. The complete dissolution of our nation. The destruction of our culture. There is no room for Buddha in their world. Our only hope is to fight.
Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. We have compassion for all people.
You are in great danger. The Dalai Lama cannot fall into Chinese hands. You must flee.
It is a difficult situation.
Hmm.
The land has stayed in the family. We work together. The nobleman is not too bad.
Ma'am, how could you not report this?  He puts human life at risk and--
And what would he do come winter?
Around here.  Yeah.
A spring trap!
Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God--
Gee, that would really disappoint me.
Bastard bit my chopper.
I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to--
Where is he?
If he's here, I'll find him.  Did she tell you we had sex together?
<u>Jack</u>!
You're gonna be okay.
And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow?
I'm not making it up.
Oh my God.
No.  U.S. Wildlife is on their way.
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
You <u>did</u>, you--
Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
You're having the best time of your life, aren't you?
What?
You're mushing it a little around the--
Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!
Hector!!
So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
Now I'm gonna puke.
And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?
<u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.
That's where they keep them.  You want me to bring the tooth out here?
This is a little different.
Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.
<u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u>?
You're sort of a rude person.
I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp.
You threw it at me!!
You hurt his feelings.  I think you should go apologize.
Well Hector's a giant cracker.
I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?
Should I?
Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?
Hey.
Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
It has nothing to do with--
I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just never thought of you as a y'know...
Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?
You missed Fourth Amendment law. Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. Where were you all afternoon?
Agent Starling! Telephone!
Some fishermen in West Virginia found an unidentified girl's body. It's a Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in the water about a week, and Jack needs somebody that can print a floater. Think you can handle it?
FBI, Catherine, you're safe.
I don't know! Get me out!!
Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.
Okay, Miss Starling?
Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling.
Starling, Clarice M., good morning.
You see, the one we want most refuses to cooperate. I want you to go after him again today, in the asylum.
The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and Miggs crying. They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless.  Starling...?
The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -
He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?
I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now.
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
How many women has he used, our Bill?
It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.
You're a tough one, aren't you?
Why don't you tell me about "Miss Mofet?" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?
If you didn't kill him, then who did?
I never thought about it.
Quid pro quo, Doctor.
Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?
On what basis would they reject him?
I thought you might want your drawings back... Just until you get your view.
Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -
We don't reckon time the same way, Clarice. This is all the time you'll ever have.
So you ran away...
But you could. You did.
Thank you, Clarice.
I'm not having a witch hunt here, Mr. Crawford! Our patients are decent, non-violent people with a real problem.
I'm the one who found his perforating proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, right now?  Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I?
Better known to his friends as the Death's-head Moth...
Well that is to be expected. My father...
In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?
No. I will find you.
There was none!
Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?
My God, Alice.
I see...
He knew the penalty for breaking regulations.  He ought to pay without sending you to beg.
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
Any powder?
What did you say?
Got a reason to stay.
Does Webb not even know we are besieged?
Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...
"Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women.  When his women want to eat, he lay aside his tomahawk to feed their laziness."
Three, four oxen... much wampum.
Yes.
Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant antagonist. I am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend.
And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
Their arms?
Le mot d'ordre?
Here.  Put this on.  You examine him.
Was there such a thing?
It's got Hazy!
Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!
No!
That's an order!
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
I need more light on that, Four.
Shit!  He sent them all.
Where's Doc?!
Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
Twenty minutes...
Give me a readout, DeJesus.
Okay.
Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
If he had his blinkers on--
Itches like hell.
So that's all you do?...
I ain't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself.
C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...
Typhoon?!
How far away is she?
We've got to get him to the infirmary.
Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
Tip top, Willie...tip top.
It saw us!
How much did you part with?
It's hit us all hard!
Bacon, see what we got.
The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because there is no evidence against us.
What's that?
Next time we do a job like this we gonna want more money, or we are going back to post offices and cars.
I don't know what you mean.
You're doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that because you need to know.
Nope.
It looks like t, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.
I got the money to pay for 'em.
We gotta get those guns.
It must be this one.
Where?
Invitations.
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.
What was that, armed? What do you mean, armed? Armed with what?
And we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them.
What do you mean?
I'll see ya.
For half a million?
Do you want me to draw a picture?
Well, perhaps you can help?
They look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these muskets?
What have you come as?
If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind that, what about the money?
Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?
That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?
That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
Er, fertilizer.
Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help.
Well?
Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--
Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves?
September '97, that's all she wrote.
Everybody on the border knows that story.
You uhm--you remember what old Buddy carried for a side arm?
A .45--
So is Buddy on your short list?
You still going to all the home games?
You look awful good in that uniform, though.
What?
It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command.
No sir.
They were in the Army. Like your father.
Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
Well--
My father says the day you're  born you start from scratch, no breaks and no excuses, and you got to pull yourself up on your own.
You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive.
My father.
This place is a gold mine.
Right.
Cliff--
Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.
Maybe.
Seriously, I think we should get married.
I was driving back from Apache Wells when they got me on the radio.
That ring--
Good deal you were born down here, then.
That where he was shot?
That's where he fell.
Deal drugs in the bathroom--
Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
Right.
I gonna meet that family of yours?
Reputation?
Como se llama? [What's your name?]
We was by the river? And I hear my friend callin' for help, and I look and she has falling in the water--
You think you're doing these people a favor? What are they going to do? Either they get on welfare or they become criminals--
I am marry to the cousin of a friend-- but only to be able to live here. This is the mother of my child--
Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see!
Senora, anything it costs, I can work--
Historic occasion, isn't it?
I always wondered what you Mayors do when you're not cutting ribbons.
Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing hooky--
No.
There's no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years.
We have a murder?
I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.
Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.
There must have been somebody.
Mrs. Bledsoe?
You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?
He had the club out on the old trail road--
So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
And when my father was Sheriff?
What about it?
I'm not open. We were just talking.
Not if you have half a brain in your head.
How come?
It was for personal consumption.
Your father never bothered me about it. Leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s.
And your mother was a saint. That summer I built the patio at your house? She made me lunch every day.
Your boy, there--
Nice-looking kid.
With Paloma, it's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's never been book-smart. Had a hard time learning to read. Me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment--like a betrayal.
Pilar--
Yeah.
I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.
She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.
Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
You're out early.
Sam? I--the Committee--you know Jorge and H.L. and all--they asked me--
I didn't want to be going around your back.
This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come.
You telling me what to do, Roderick?
What's this I see? Is that whiskey in them glasses on the Bar? Roderick, I'm gonna have to cite you for a violation of state law--
This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
No--
Payne.
You haven't paid the cab.  He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him.
Nix.
Nix?
Death.
So tell me where Nix is buried.
Ever watched a man die?  If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. And if you're very quick, you can catch it.
And are you afraid?
You don't?
We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
What about Jennifer Desiderio?
What did you find?
Stuff?
Nothing's going to happen to you.
I was so afraid.
Yes.
No!  No!  No!
... oh... God...
... they believe you.
Where the fuck is he?
--vanished.
For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
Whatever I said, I didn't mean it, okay?  I get a few drinks inside me --
You know of him?
Probably.
Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.
I want to speak to Dorothea.
I'm afraid she's not in.
Leave her alone --
Was that Swann's idea?
No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after.
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
Don't bother.
My God.
What?
I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
I only wear ties for funerals.
How the fuck do you do that?
It's me betrayed him.
You think I'm an asshole.
No.
He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything.  He made us think it was over and done with.
He's not!  He's not!
Swann?  What are you doing?
You could still help me do that.
Why would I want to?
I don't want to go home.
Of course.
Hans was very attentive to you.
No, you smiled.
Why do they switch the r's and l's here?
I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.
It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
Four.
We should get you to the doctor.
Working.
Do you ever see him?
Oh, I guess you're busy, huh.
You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?
What do you want to drink?
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
It's really hard to reach you... Did you get the carpet samples? I like the burgundy.
Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.
What are you talking about?
Hello?
When are you coming home?
Great.
You wanna come?
Sure.
Hair stuff?
But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.
Yeah, I know you have to work the whole time, I'll probably have more fun here. I'll call Charlie and those guys.
Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?
I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
...doing like twenty million interviews a day... It's soo good to see you. How long are you here for?
Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?
I'm gonna have to get a restraining order.  What a nightmare.
Honey, you're exhausted.  Do you want to lie down for a little while?
And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.
I can take care of myself.
Mr. Kelson, what a pleasure to meet you. I have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable.  I am a fan.
This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.
Father, I have nowhere else to stay.
No matter, my son, he believes in you.
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
Why are you doing this to me?
-- you wouldn't last five minutes.
An exorcism was just held for Birdson. It failed.  Disastrously.  Which means there's still a demonic spirit present in his body.  I was wondering, perhaps you'd like to go meet Henry.  He's pretty amazing.
So...what did you think of the tape.
What do you mean?
And the point is?
The good outwitting the bad.  It's like Birdson had a split personality.
You should think about getting professional help.
I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.
Nothing yet.
It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.
He couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished.  Peter, what time were you born?
Why did you lie to me about your parents' deaths?
Plenty of time.
What can I do?
Book five, Deuteronomy, chapter seven, verse five.  "But this shall you deal with them.  You shall break down their altars and burn their graven images with fire."
Hello?
Maya?  What do you mean?
And what are you thinking we should do now?
Sometimes I can just feel the numbers.
There weren't any voices.
What do you mean by that?
So, Viznick's got a meet with his lawyer in the ayem.
Parents died?
What happened?
Mother killed the father, then killed herself.  Crime of passion.
No I don't.
Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
That's ridiculous.
That's all you cared about.  I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two.
Which one for tomorrow?
So that means it's alright for you to act like that?
Thanks.
I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
Why not?
So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet?
I know...
Mom tell you to do this?
This brother from my college.
Yeah, right.
They ever love you back?
You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.
I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been hearing good things about you.
What's up?
How's that been?
Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.
I just can.
Your Dad play?
I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.
He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
For how long?
My Dad always drives my Mom.
Didn't know you cared so much.
So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?
See, that's why you ain't getting recruited.
That's it, give it your best shot.
You don't look half-bad.
Hey.
You having fun?
Early night for you, isn't it?
Four.
What?
What?
That was so weak.
Why not?
he's just playing, Q...
What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?
You don't think so?
Just something I'm trying.
Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...
You're serious.
Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him.  Now, I kinda think I need to try something else.
You asked me what was missing.
What?
I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.
I had some players to see and hands to shake.
Not great.
We were just studying.
Later when?
Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.
So what are you gonna do?
Your teeth are straight.
I can't believe you're gonna do this to me, the situation I'm in, I don't -- Avi: You know what?  Being hit by lighting doesn't matter for getting braces, ok? Now Solomon, let me just ask you once: Please. Please. Don't do this.
You smell like trouble --
You fuckin' don't do that. You don't do it, you cocksucker. I'll fuckin' kill you with my barehands.  Go. get the fuck fuck -- we're going back and we finish the show --
What's wrong?
Uh-huh.
It was scary though.
It's a helluva disease.
What do you want? Why are you here?
I'd like to talk to you.  Your boyfriend let me in, I just knocked on the door --
Wanna call me a slut now, something?
What the fuck do you want?
Don't sit down.
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
OPEN THE DOOR.
No.
You just move in here?
Yeah.
I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --
Yeah.
No. No.  Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia.  Please, now.
Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
No, no.  I was wondering...man oh man. I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want to do which is to ask you on a date.
No.
Do you wanna go tonight?  I mean, are you working?
Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's?
Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something.  They want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them --
To not do that.  To not do that that we've maybe done -- before --
Yeah.
I'll take everything at face value. I'll be a good listener to you.
I have to go to the bathroom, Cynthia.
Jesus Christ, Stanley, you can't go to the bathroom now.  You have exactly one minute before we're back on the air, this is NOT the time to go to the bathroom.
It's ok --
You don't just sign up to be a police officer -- it's about three years of training -- ok?
Ok. Listen. You: c'mere.

You're a friend of the family I presume?
You talk in rhymes and riddles and ra...rub-adub --- but that doesn't mean anything to me, see....see...see I used to be smart....I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith. I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the tv --
-- I give you money, I give you a paycheck. Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give. When I find you, when I meet you, what? I put you on the billboard, I put you in the store, my salesman, my fucking representation of Solomon and Solomon Electronic, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the game show --
Two years! Two years later and out of your paycheck, I never charge interest --
You don't need braces.
...ah...
She loves you.
How come every word you say is either "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?"
Do me a personal favor --
...find him on the...Frank. His name's Frank Mackey --
No.
Twelve.
Is this 509-9027?
Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over --
-- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?
I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --
the valley?
And you ended up at UC Berkely --
It's not your given name, right?
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?
He's in here.
Uh. huh.
Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little...
There's no disturbance.
No one else in here?
Did your wife find out?
I need you to get me Paula --
What were you saying, Stanley?
I went to see her -- some fuckin' asshole answers the door in his underwear, he's fifty years old, there's coke and shit laid out on the table --
I love you.
You're my handsome man.
I'm a bad person.
No, I mean:  I'm telling you this, now. You see?  You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up....
I don't even remember...many...twenty... maybe more...not much more...twenty times.
No.
What about now?
I'm not mad.  I am, but I'm not.  Y'know?
...Jimmy...
<u>I don't know what I've done</u>.
I don't know what I've done.
Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay?
Do you have an agent, Stanley?
Linda, you're safe.  Ok. It's alright. You're my friend.  You and Earl are my clients and what you need to talk about won't leave this room, you have something you have to say --
This is not any fucking medication talking, this isn't -- I don't know. I don't know -- Can you give me nothing? You have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking will -- I don't want any money, I couldn't live with myself, this thing I've done -- I've fucking done so many bad things -- I fucked around.  I fucked around on him, I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You're his lawyer, our laywer, THERE, I'm his wife, we are married. I broke the conract of marriage, I fucking cheated on him, many times over, I sucked other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - ....fuck.... Other Things I've Done..
What are you doing?
Why didn't you answer those questions?
Are we gonna keep going with this game?
I think that you have to be nicer to me.
I have money.
And you were not hurt?
There were two.  Not one.  But two.
He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.
Porthos sleeps, and you plot.  Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting?
Those are the words of a broken spirit.  My spirit is whole.  I have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets, and I will never believe he is my enemy.
Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
Go on.
We must stop him!
Look at us.  We are old men now.  But once we were young.  And when we saw injustice, we fought it.
A tomb?  We're in a tomb?
The greatest secret of life is who we truly are.  Now I must give you that secret, which has been kept from you your whole life.  It began on the night when Louis was born.
Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.
D'Artagnan watches everything.  We have to be lucky.
Mother's ring.  I can't take this.
I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.
I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.
I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul --
There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?
The room of the King's favorite mistress?
Then there is one more thing, of an even more personal nature.
What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.
You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!
Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --
Silence!  I order you!
I want all these passages sealed! Another stupid idea of my father's! Seal them all, every one!
I was told this impostor was dead!
You dead yet?
Did they kill him?
Riots?  My people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?
Ah yes, the riots.  We have food stocks on the wharves right now, no?
The food doesn't please you?
I... we are humble people...
Shall I leave?
I will order a Mass for his soul. It will guarantee his place in Heaven.
Captain Doyle?
If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
What do you need?
So what?
Where are you?
Did you hit him?
Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
So you must have known Fleming... and Stanton -
Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.
And what did he do to the girl?
No Zydowski I didn't read today's paper - it's just going to irritate the hell out of me.
I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.
What exactly did you see?
I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
Yeah.
Shit, you know what happens to me if I'm harboring a fugitive?  I already think they're on to me! I thought you were the phone police for Chrissake!
OK, I'm logged on to the municipal network.  I'm showing sixteen people with the name Sarah Williams in L.A. county.  None of them live in Hollywood.  Do you remember the address?
You know this time, there's nobody that's gonna cover your ass. You're over your head this time.
Both at the same bank...
Are you going to be alright?
What would your - boyfriend - think?
You don't seem afraid of much.
He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.
I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...
Could he handle a direct contact?
The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  I don't have an answer for you.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this.
The main thing is: how was Lecktor to reply.
That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out.  At the top it says: 'I hope we can correspond.' And then the hole begins.  It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away.
It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.
That could be the tip of a 't.  Here and here. And here.
Not the Bible?
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books...
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
No.
Let's talk after dinner. Stay and eat.
What's one way?
We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?
Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack.
See? You do know something about him.
Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time.
Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?
Get me a plane...
I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes.
VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
He's a very shy boy...
It's getting late and...
We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in.  They're in the far corner of the room under the windows.
Parking permits...
When do you need it?
How did you come to Gateway?
You worked out well.
Yes, are you okay...?!
I don't want to know.
Do you see?
Not me.
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
Dr. Chilton.
Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
To yourself...
I understand he cut you pretty good...
If I were?
Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
You haven't smoked in two years.
Can you quit?
No.
What will you do?
Mama was probably asleep.
Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you.
They don't want me up there. Every time they look at me I remind them... If they thought about it, they'd want you. Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you.  But they don't want to see me...
My grandboy's been eatin' a ton of breakfast every day. Been out riding. Must be the good air. You oughta see that little booger eat.  I'll bet he's gained ten pounds.  Molly's out in the motor home...
Meet point's up ahead!
What do you want?
Are you George Sherman?
I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom...
No. You're very well-protected.  No one can find our where you are.
Yes.
I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it?
How?
No.
And?
A layman..., layman. Interesting term. So many experts on government grants. And you say you're a 'layman?' But it was you who caught me, wasn't it, Will? Do you know how you did it'
You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.
Then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me.
Yes.
I don't have one right now.
I haven't decided yet.
You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.
I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us.  Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it?
I don't believe in God.
So I understand you're from Lithuania?
People love... comedians.
Andy, c'mon IN!  Thanks for flyin' out here!!
I refuse.
Andy!
The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special!
What, you don't think I can beat him?
I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!
Really?
Right...
What do you mean?
Andy, the theater's that way!
Popcorn?
Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??
How can you be so casual??!
Don't worry!  The kids will love it --
Go to commercial, man!  Get off the stage!
Then your father's a wimp.
What is this, World War Two...?
This is great.  The crowd's gonna love this!  Hey... do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive?
Please!  You've GOT to let me take the classes!  It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!
We had a deal!!
I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you!
Why...?  Andy, why...?
Are you tryin' to do some of that Polack humor?  Well if that's so, you can just get the hell out of this restaurant!
Lieutenant?
Oh shit.
I sent two units.  They're bringing her down now.
You're two hours late.
Don't be ridiculous.
There's something about him, isn't there?
... yes.
Just get me outta here.
How long?
Right now?
How?!
The cubicle across from you is empty.
The agents --
Ironically, this is not far from the truth.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo, why are you here?
What are you doing?
A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?
This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson.
How does she know?
She helped you?
Morpheus, the Oracle... she told me --
Got it.
Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
Tank, charge the E.M.P.
How...?!
You're the Oracle?
So?  What do you think?  You think you're the One?
What?
From what?
And I know that's not where you want to be.
What is this thing?
E.M.P.  An electromagnetic pulse.
God...
What?
Is it?
What happened?  What did you see?
Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
No one has ever done anything like this.
The last human city.  The only place we got left.
Yes.  They're moving him.  I don't know where yet.
I gotta get the stuff.
May God be with you.
'My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.'
Who's the girl?
Get out of here before this really goes up.
Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me.  My mother can send me some.  I don't know.
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
You sick or what?  You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?
I could have told you that.
Don't come any closer!!!
It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?
Don't you move!!!
What are you going to do?  Hide me?
Your Uncle's a good man...I won't stick him.  Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place.  And tell me why should I care?  I got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out...who disappears and leaves me with all the problems.  I should go back to Florida...I don't need this.
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
Where's the rest?
Diane, how are you feeling?
You know Diane...I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a...  aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...I... a...I really...think that you're a terrific performer...
Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?
...but it's the same thing, all the same...they're in there by having something on somebody...and when that doesn't work...they fight...Our life has honor...we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do.  They know where to come when they need us.  I realize this during the war...World War II...Vito Genovese... during WWII he worked with the government, taking care of the docks...
I'd like to eat something before I go back to work.
It's all right.
C'mon Charlie...one more day.  I'll call in sick for work.
Sure...He lives there?
Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
Sal!... fourteen street.
No...no.  Nooo...it's just that I...I...uh... this ain't my car.
Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
His wife?
Hi, Allison --
Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
I do it because I love you.  Because everybody I loved you.  Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you.
What do you do that for?
Good, good.  Glad to hear it.
Toast?  No...just the butter.
Oh, you're the great Joe's attorney now?  Are we going to go to court? Or are we going to go to bed?  And I don't mean you and me.  I mean you and him.
Here...
Why yes, thank you.
Yes.
It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
A voice?
In my sleep.
I was saying to Quince we won't need --
...Tomorrow we sign off -- photo opportunity, you and Big John, it'll lead network news.  Okay so far?
Our first annual report, must be thirty-five years ago now, I owned two stations, I wrote down a state- ment of purpose, that one day you would wake up to a Parrish radio station, read a Parrish paper at breakfast, catch our news on tele- vision during the day, and go to bed with one of our books or magazines and you would always be told the truth and in the bargain, have a good time.
Is there any more to it?
...Sounds like you're not leaving much room for discussion.
Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill?
In English, please.
You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.
Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --
Well, I'm happy to tell you I've got good news.  As I was telling Drew, I've been making a little hay while the Bontecou sun was shining -- two, possibly three new and boiling hot prospects for merger.
You wait here'n to take us?  Like you bus driver to dere?
Don' be facety, woman.
Don' need you okayin'.
Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.
Didn't the family get together last night --?
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
Don't bother asking, we already tried.
That's very gracious of you, Quince.
Love.
Oh yes, I do.
Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.
I'm lost.
You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
I don't have any.
Patients have visitors, not doctors.
I have to go, I'm sorry to say --
I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
I'm sorry about --
-- Could you?
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
I can tell you the when part.  Tonight.
We know all that we need to know --
I believe that, don't you?
The 'coffee shop' --
'Threw' you?  Where?
...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
Yes, Bill.
There's one to every rule.
What do you mean?
What's it like where I'm going?
Would you like to sit down, Joe?
...I'd like to be alone for a while.
Now I'd like to be alone.
Truly - uh - splendid.
You were just curious?
I wouldn't put it that way.
I'm sorry, Bill --
I'm her father!
And I don't give a shit.
Yes?
-- And I'm in love with your daughter.
Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.
Which is what?
It's time to put this person where he belongs.
I told you to shut up.
I'll take it from here --  I am --
I am not a dream.
You should hope quite a while.
I don't!
What are you talking about?
What is this, a joke, right?  Some kind of elaborate practical joke? At my 40th reunion, we delivered a casket to the Class president's hotel room and --
Get what?
Watch it!
Yes what?
What question?
Eddie?
Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?
Drew told me.
I thought you were in a meeting--?
And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without.  If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with?  I say fall head over heels.  Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  And how do you find him?  Forget your head and listen to your heart.  I'm not hearing any heart.  Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back.  Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try.  Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.
I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
Thank God.
We've met.
Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
Susan, I don't think Joe is going to be with us long.
Are you relieved?
If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.
You and 'Honey'?
I agree --
47.
Slam it?
So you're holding my calls?
Shit. Wrong room.
This isn't your room. You're in 304. I Fucked up.
This isn't my room?
This was your room. You're up in 304 now.
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.
I know you said you didn't want any calls...
Why?
Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.
How do I know he did that to you?
I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
I'll go see him.
What's wrong?
No!
Kill him. I'll pay you.
Yes.
* Depends on if he's here in town. Or if he's moved on. See, I've got all this -			*
My boyfriend told me about you.
Are you Teddy?
We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal.
I'm not appealing the decision.
Unfinished business. What made you think I wasn't coming back?
It's my condition. I never know if I've already eaten, so I always just eat small amounts.
You don't know him?
I don't think so.
How'd ya get him in here in the first place?
Fuck you. We shoulda taken his car.
Why are you following me?
Happy now?
How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
Like how'd you get this car? That suit?
My wife's death. I used to work in Insurance, we were well covered.
Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran -
How do you know him?
You won't remember!
Why do you keep lying to me?					 *
Your name's Teddy.
I should kill you.							 *
It is now.
Yeah.
Quarter mile away.  We see the lights...
I was the kids' godfather.
Sal Maguda.
...I didn't want you around the crime scene because it's crawling with federal law enforcement.  We don't know who's straight up, who's not...
Where's the new drop point...?
Not anymore.  This is a distribution network out of South Florida, moving poly-drug loads, crystal meth through coke, to Nashville, Atlanta, Memphis, Cleveland.  And computer fraud, identity theft. It's like that.
Tell them what you want.
Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.
There is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product...
So where's the best place for mojitas?
Your father?
What's the best fortune you ever got?
A few more moments, still in this business.  Then I'd find you.
Jos...
How 'bout this?  How'd Neptune know where to hit us?  Huh?  Whose Op sec's got a leak?  Yours?
He didn't.  Interrogation's not in our skill set.  So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations?
Packaging?
Proof of life.  How do I know Mrs. Rico's alive?
What is it?
Where we meeting 'em...?
Gina in the Miami pad.  You gonna give me phony denials?
Their loads are poly-drug.  "E" from Holland, methamphetamine precursors from Jordan, Afghan "H." Mid-ocean transshipments.  His real business is:  he's a network.
And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
You think I am in so deep I forgot?
Go ahead.
4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.
And the deal goes down at another place at another time.
How?
You're so <u>not</u> the PD, if you got busted on a DUI, you're in serious trouble...you're bad men back to grammar school.  San Quentin.  Pelican Bay.  Marine Corps.  Statesville. Pelican Bay, where you guys hooked up.  Now you're too smart and too fast to get jacked again...
How will it stand up?
Alonzo?  What are you talking about?  Where are you...?
C'mon, man!
Who are you talking to?
So?
Okay.
They've been targeted.  And Pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now.
I run down the numbers.  Nothing is very negotiable.  Small loads?  We pay three thousand a ki. We pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent.  The next ten percent on U.S. landfall.
Equipment?
What do you care?
This the load you lost a while back?
Hers'n zodda meg a livig.
Must be some mess back there.
I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...
Okay. Never argue with a man.
... you see what I'm getting at here? She got a penthouse up there with color TV and more goddam diamonds than an archbishop and she busts out bawling when I ask for money!
I think you just put your finger on it, I do.
You keep the sixty-four cents. I want you to have it.
Well, I hope you know what you're in for. I'm a very dangerous person. Someone does me bad like you. If I caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead Ratso long about now. Hear?
This is an okay setup you got here, but I'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?
Not bad -- for a cowboy -- you're okay, you're okay.
The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect.
Don't say nothing about you either.
Well, I made it. This here is Ratso Rizzo and I...
What'll happen. I mean what they do to, you know, do with you -- if you can't -- ah, Christ!
You're what?
Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?
Instant V-goddam-D.
Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right?
He fell. Hey, fella, you fell. Is he all right?
Years?
Tunnel?
To what?
Dad...I'm...
Why'd you do it, Billy?
You know where they are?
Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?
Would you recognize him again?
Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred.
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.
How long?
The Prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession; he wanted a smuggling conviction and the High Court in Ankara reviewed it.
You got your stuff?
What?
You know where it is?
Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.
And a right.
...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...
You said those cables're still live. Can't we rewire...?
What do you-?
You better tell me what the hell's going on here!
What are you putting that crap on me for?
It would take a minute or so.  You won't last that long out there.
Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.
What?
Well, I just thought--oh, look at me. You'd think I'd never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink?
Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.
Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?
The profanity bothers you?
I made you my speciality--scrambled eggs a la Wilkes. And I'm on page 75.
Thank you so much.
Yes. I told you I was your number- one fan.
She's a fine... uh... pig is what she is...
The Sistine Chapel?
You...you dirty bird. She can't be dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! How could you?
I DIDN'T...
I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
You want me to burn my book?
If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating?
Annie, what's the matter?
Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.
Well, is it fair? Should I keep going?
A toast?
Paul, I know you've been out.
Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles...
Stop--stop right here.
What is it?
I'm sure you know Paul's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books.
No, no, of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him...
No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door.
So do I...
Answer me a couple things?
When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then.
I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study.
That'd be a first.
All done, chief..
Not everything.  Why do you think she's really here?
How do you that.
Then don't say it.
I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
Good.  Biocyte stock is just a week or two away from going through the roof.
Where?
I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.
If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together.
Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?
I need your help and I thin you can use mine.
Which is?
You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
Ask a question, you get an answer!..
Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life.
You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?
But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a bloody thief.
Not me.  I was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical.
What wouldn't make him suspicious?
Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is keeping a very capable thief off the street..
You'll be fine.  I'm going to lose you.
Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times.  What's that about?
Nyah, you've done more than enough.  Even the best of snake charmers get bit.
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Excuse me?
You made it sound as if I was recruiting her for her skills as a thief.
Very.
We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
Aren't you even curious?  About why she did it?
I do.
Put in the coordinates and let's get a visual.  The visuals aren't coming up.
Luther..get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on Bruny Island last month, including photos of the victims.
Ambrose just pulled the memory card out of the digital camera and put it into an envelope, put it in his inner left jacket pocket...
Left jacket pocket confirmed.
Ambrose got Bellerophon from Nekhorvich on the plane, but he didn't get the Chimera virus.
Sorry, that it a Biocyte facility, their storage structure..
Thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop.
Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?
His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
So what do you suggest?
<u>Think</u>, for Christ's sake, you guys are mired in detail, open your minds, it's gotta be staring us in the face!  What does Ethan Hunt <u>want</u>?!
What kind of show.
We got it.  On your feet.
Take off your coat.
Since your father's death, your family's farm has been in sub-chapter S and now, suddenly, they're flush with over a hundred and twenty grand in the bank. Dad's illness was supposed to have wiped out the bank account -- dying slowly in America after all, can be a very expensive proposition Ethan.  So, why don't we go quietly out of here onto the plane...
Can I ask you something, Kittridge?
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
What kind?
You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
I'm not letting this list get out in the open.
About what?
He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.
Six million dollars.  I'll give you the same.  But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want the <u>entire</u> list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.
It doesnt, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
Simple game.  Four players.  Exfil opens the pocket --  -- cyber ops lifts the wallet.
Zero body count.
Sorry, am I interrupting?
OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open the doors.
Would you remove your hat please?
I thought I was going to see Max.
Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.
Abort.  Thats an order.
Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
- no.  She cant know about me.  No one can.  Not til this is over.  Theres too much at stake, Ethan.
Arent you going to thank me Jim.  Ten million is better than six.
Such a nice ass.
How long until we reach the Chunnel?
Are you ready?
I forgot to bring the champagne, Mr. Johnny.
Who's dead?
Rita. Pass the wine.
Where you been?
I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.
I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
You haven't said anything.
Where's Ma?
He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.
So you'll come to the wedding, right?
I got it done.
You're married.
You have such a head for knowing. You know everything.
What do you want me to do? Pick up after five dogs? I'm eighty-three years old. God in his heaven understands that I cannot pick up after five dogs.
He's in Palermo.
Have you come from my brother?
You are going to marry my brother?
It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fianc saw that I was maimed, she left me for another man.
I like it well done.
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
What are you doing!
Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool!
I can't believe what is happening.
Your blood.
Loretta.
What about Johnny?
She didn't like me.
You look beautiful. Your hair...
Awful?
Yeah.
He didn't come!
I'm here!
You're late!
This is your place.
Yeah.
I'm really afraid.
I'm afraid of who I am.
No, I'll tell him.
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
We haven't spoken in five years. There was some bad blood. I want you to call him and invite him to the wedding. Will you do it?
I don't know. But Johnny, how did your mother recover? She was dying.
I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone.
What?
Why not?
Did he tell her?
No. But I have a hangover.
Where's pop?
Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession.
Lucy. There are big things going on in my house. My granddaughter Loretta, the only daughter of my son Cosmo, has engaged herself to be married a second time.
I don't know.
Don't fight.
Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her.
Who was that?
No idea.
When I was twenty-seven years old, in Jersey City, I asked a woman to marry me. She had red hair. She smelled a jasmine. She wore black shoes with pointy white tips.
Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you?
That woman was a student of yours?
I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning along and I look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and I'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn't last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.
You knew that man?
It's a house.
Rita. Rita.
Cosmo.
Yes!
It's not a question of where he grips it,  It's a simple matter of weight - ratios ...  A five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut.
But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
Knights Who Say "Ni" ... we are but simple travellers.  We seek the Enchanter who lives beyond this wood and who ...
None shall pass.
I command you, as King of the Britons to stand aside.
I move for no man.
I've had worse.
What are you going to do. bleed on me?
I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
Well now, Launcelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall and then leap out of the rabbit and take the French by surprise, not only by surprise but totally unarmed!
Ni!
I do.  You seek the Holy Grail.
... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.
Old woman!
What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...
I told you,  We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune,  we take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week.
You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!
I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!
Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.
Good idea, O Lord!
I can't.
Thanks very much.
I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.
I don't want land.
No ... just keep him in here.
What?
Quick!
You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
No, no, this cannot be.   I am sworn to chastity!
They're all saying the word ...
I speak as I find, Archie.
Seventy a year.
It's better than shovelling horse shit.
They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?
I'm getting dressed.
You watch your tongue.
I hope to go up next year.
Good man.  And is she all right?
Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.
It is quite late enough.
And that is my last word on the matter.
The order of seating at the Upper Servant's table is arranged personally by the Queen herself.
Who'll bring it to me?
Then we'll have to see what can be arranged.
There is to be no communication with other members of the household on matters concerning the court except through myself or one of the Equerries.  No plans must be altered unless you are given prior authority by myself or a senior member of the household.
I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.
Do you?
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.
So...?
You are well?
My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you.  He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way.  I trust it does not inconvenience you too much.
The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.
I am thinking of publishing my "Highland Journals."
Who by?
I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming.
I do not do it for others.  But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
What is it, John?  John?
Must they always follow us?
Yes, ma'am?
I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
Then why send me back to them?!
Should we take it seriously?
The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
I see the Prince of Wales is here.
The Royal Family and senior members of the household, ma'am.
Unwell?
What's the question mark?
Nick, Alex, how are we today?
Now what seems to be the problem?
If this is a joke, I'm not laughing.
Sick?
Yeah...
Happy?
Something's happened to them.
It's the middle of the night.  They're asleep.  Phone didn't wake them.
It's not this weird.  It'll make sense. Everything gets weird this late anyway, right?
Change the channel!
Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence.  It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something.  It's self-replicating...it mimics life.
It's already out.
I've been thinking about that.  ARCADE's like a virus, so it seems like the place to hit him would be where the virus started.  You know, like his point of origin?
I'll take the lead and handle the physical threats.  You watch the elapsed time and look for exits.
And we've still got time left.  This was a piece of cake.
I'm okay.
It means she's screwed up.
One of these cities, is the place you seek. The Teller of Truths will take you there. But the City of Lies, is dark and bleak. And death is certain if you enter, beware.
What's going on, Cynthia?
They fired everyone.
What do you mean "you know"?
But I'm not broke.
And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?
I'm just offering a place to stay.
There is no problem.
Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
What did I say?
Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?
Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
How...  how'd they know I was here?
I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
I told ya.
No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.
I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.
She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.
It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.
What is it Rita?
Nothing. I do remember the car crash... I told you... I remember the glass ... I think about that sometimes ... I remember walking here, sort of. Now I remember this place and you. That's about it.
The money. You don't know where it came from?
Unh, unh.
Mulholland Drive.
There's nothing?
"Stop! Just Stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before..."
Oh, no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to fix a sandwich. You want one?
Betty Elms.
Oh boy.
To get rid of this god-awful feeling.
Yeah, they showed me
The one of 'em still alive?
Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.
Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.
A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
Why should we trust you ?
What about Matt ?
You said we were criminals, what did you mean ?
Hey ! I'm still your best chance to get out of here alive.
So why this ?
Why did you build this whole place ?
There are other things too. They had everyone start taking those psych tests. Did they make you take one ?
I don't get it.
Yeah a real shame.
Are you Matthew Parker ?
That's nice.  I think I lost my wallet.
Is it over ?
Fire the whole division.
Of course.
Sir, he created the Park. He would know how to circumvent any of the traps.
What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
He has a phone pole sticking in his chest, I think we don't need an autopsy.
Are you happy with your salary and position ?
We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
Will he make it out ?
<<belch>>
What the ... ?
What happened ?
This is too easy, I mean I had a speech prepared, then I even wore these pants because I could get on my knees to grovel.
What an incredible view !
Are you okay ?
I'm talking to you asshole !
You don't have to sound so emphatic.
No, idiot. Where do we go now ?
Good morning.
I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....
Look, Miss. I know you're still upset about that incident in Chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business. We don't have time to play nursemaid to every single Tom Dick and Harry.
Are you writing a poem?
My mother took this course with you at UCLA...&quot;The Foundations of Poetic Thought&quot;.
What about giving the other guy a break.
I thought I told you to lose this guy.
Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.
Dad, when a boy likes you, does he pretend that he doesn't like you? And if he pretends that he doesn't like you how can you tell that he likes you?
What boy likes you?
Bye Dad, I'll miss you.
Well if there was an article about it I'm sure she did. She was always reading.
It's okay really, I was just a baby.
Oh.  Ohhh?
I'm glad you're here.
You are?
That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.
Special effects?
She's beautiful.
I'd say you turned out just fine.
oh.
He likes you.
Hi.
If it's in here at all, it's in the back two rows.
Thanks, but I think I'm gonna stick to my mom, she led a fascinating life too.
There's water in your bathroom.
I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it to me.
They obviously have no sense of historical perspective either.
I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm getting a nose bleed from the altitude.
Get married?
I don't think anybody should change their names, that way you can always find them when you need them.
Just call us the &quot;dead end kids&quot;.
Hey what do I care...I mean, consider the sorts, a chick from Pennsylvania, who wears a mood ring.
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
Just give it to me!!
...I dropped it.
How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?
I should do this myself.
Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly.
Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled?
No, there's no problem, Dr. Helburn just needs to have his oil changed.
Wait, are you saying that I don't appreciate?
I'm saying he asked me out for coffee, like a real date, when was the last time you did that?
You couldn't?
Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike.
I know, I guess it's just sort of preparing you for the rest of your life. It's not easy being a woman.
Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?
Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so.
Yeah, it would be kinda great.
But Dad'll never go for it.
Let me hold him.
Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.
Once you put the hotels on board walk and Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.
How do I know you were gonna show us one?
Of what??
Danny?
What am I doing here????? What am I doing here?
Keep your voice down!
The boss is watching us...
I'm impressed.
What Hurts Vada?
They're dead?
Pardon?
I need the job.
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
Kinda like men.
I had a good time tonight.
Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute.
Are you mad at me?
Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.
Here?
This is where we are.
Kiss me.
Perfect.
I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. And i've learned to live with this chicken Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction.  Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only mean one thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying.
That's a lot of money for a little girl.
Dad?
HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're doing.
When?
I like the freak show.
In the garage.
Do you miss her?
Oh yes, oh that's great.
Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J.
No.
My Dad was funny?
Are you going out somewhere?
No.
This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit.  We used to be married.
Oh great!
I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!
I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
Reel it in.  He's only tiny, throw him back.
If I do it, can we go?
Yes.
It's my mother.
Don't DO that!!
Can we go yet?
So?
Hi Vada.
Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to boys.
Uh huh.
Yeah, it's in the contract.
You don't miss much.
See the pull of a book like Twenty Chefs, is not who I put in.  It's who I leave out.
Needs salt.
Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w...
You have a real philosophy of life.
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.
You flew all the way h...
Go figure you.
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
I'm moving this book to Viking.
The bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty. Identical twin debutantes from Nashville, who are basically vengeful sluts.  With amazing bodies!
Which was the disqualifying factor?
... luckiest guy in the Northern Fucking Hemisphere, is all I'm s...
But he sure can kiss.
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
And loving him means loving all of this.
You're enshrined in his heart and memory.  Unassailable. Which works out great.
I've missed a step.
I mean, he loves his job.
Have you sized up the groomsmen, Jules?  As M. of H., you get first fuck.  Don't pick the short, hairy, rich one.
Maybe.  I should call Ben.
Gimme like, eight and nine off the top ten list...
Should I whistle down a cab?
Last zoo we were in was... Beijing, yeah?  Sure.  The rhinos were fucking.
You guys are heartless, my bride picked this out.
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
What happened?
I'm so glad you didn't jump on that train, before...
Why would she come here...
And to m...
What?
Don't feel that way, honey.
It's fine. We were just talking about Vitamin S.
I'll tell Ester, she'll be thrilled I saw you again.
You get her those Vitamin E right away.
I appreciate your concern, but she has to rest, so you can go on home.
How is that?
His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
What does he want?
Well, how about the shopping center?
Yes. She's pretty rested up.
Okay, then we'll see you there.
Bastard
Where are you going?
Hey!
Oh... Well... Have you heard from Barnett?
Yes, sir.
Uh huh.
It's hard to say. Doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. All it was was appendix.
All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.
What did you say?
I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
Maybe you can look after me a little.
What's this?
Who's that?
I'm in a hurry, gonna see this great group record at Woodland.
Ah, hello. My name is Kenneth Fraser... And I'm here from Terre Haute, Indiana. Ah, listen ... somebody stole my handles.
Do you carry door handles?
What year?
Next you'll be sick.
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
Green?  Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled money from your grandfather
Bet the sheets are grey.
No, I don't.
Remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
Stay.
I was in prison for twenty-eight years.
What...?  0h, yes.
Hello.
What time?
Well, there's a couple of girls in Printers Alley if you got any questions. I know I've seen that G- string stuff for sale someplace around.
Hello.
An album.
Sorry I'm late.
Oh?
Come on back to bed.
Come on.
Hi.
We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him?
Who?
Peter Finch -- he's English.
I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?
Got me an audition tonight.
You serious?
Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.
You think it will?
Oh, why thank you.
Thank you. Grace, there is one other thing...
I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.
What did you think then?
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
You're a breathing icon of justice and that's why you were chosen to deliver Mr. and Mrs. Knox. We, the prison board we, knows that once you get them on the road if anything should happen, an escape attempt, an accident, fire, anything...Jack 'Supercop' Scagnetti would be there to look out for his public's best interests.
Slide the shotgun over here, put your hands behind your head, put your forehead on the floor.
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
Yeah.
The episode we did on Mickey and Mallory was one of our most popular ones.
Good...yuppie piece of shit.
What I'd like to do---
Manson beat you.
She sings? What does she sing?
Sorry about that.
Much obliged. What do I do for fun? Do you want to know what I do for fun or what I did for fun?
Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question.
Then was it worth it?
I'm sure we will.
Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...
You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?
Mickey, can I talk to you alone?
Wait! You can't kill me. Mickey and Mallory always leave somebody alive to tell the tale.
I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
How can you say that you 'admire' them?
And they made the first move?
Hypnotizing.
They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.
Just for fun, I guess.
Now we got to film a new intro for the follow up episode. But we put the intro for the first episode at the beginning temporarily so you can see it with some scope.
That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.
Roger?
Wayne Gayle.
Good work, my brothers. Fan-fuckin'- tastic! I think that interview stuff's too long, we can lose some of that. Keep the girls, keep the long hairs, keep the Hun brothers, keep the black guy, keep the movie shit, and keep the cop at the donut shop. Lose the rest. And cut the interview with the prison board fellow before that. Cut it after I ask, 'I take it by your answer it was a whole new team.' Don't even let him answer. Fuck him. Then cut to me talking about the two chicken shit psychiatrists and straight in Dr. Reinghold laughing.
Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer. We talked on the phone. It's a pleasure to meet you.
How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?
Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.
Really?
Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
So we got a deal. Four deputies---
Give her a beer.
Want me to come?
That's no way to talk, boy. Now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. Stirred up a lot of trouble. They're always after you colored boys.
Used to be. On the railroad.
No. You got the wrong idea.
What did you say your name is?
Hey, boy - I'm talkin' to you.
Okay.
Thanks.
That's two bucks, Joe.
Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
I'm a teacher.
In Birmingham.
How come you stay 'round here?
Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.
But I would like to see you again.
You almost got into trouble back there.
No, on the porch.
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
Hi.
That's Bessie Hall. Barney works at the mill.
What about them?
Am I as good as they?
Like so. There you go. Okay, hit me!
What about your boy?
I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.
There's nothing to say.
'Round town.
Like what?
Like a home, for one thing.
They all got families to support.
What's eatin' you, Jocko?
'You Will Anderson?
What happened?
Take it easy, Pop.
Better get him to a hospital.
How often is that?
Okay.
How are you?
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
Can't live without trouble, can you?  Nice place you got here. Real nice.
I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.
I doubt it.
I guess not.
It's for your own good.
Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
Let's go.
I want my wife.  I told you and told you. Now I'm gettin' tired of this shit--
Don't give her the satisfaction.  Your wife is on her way...
Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
What are you doing in here?
The corporate plundering of Yeshoto Industries... At first these seemed like unrelated incidents, but a pattern is emerging that suggests otherwise.
That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.
You ran without us.
Yeah, well it's working.
That's Lord Frederick Tessier. Owns most of Freeside. Wintermute's mainframe is centred in the Royal Family's villa.
Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier.
Okay. The floor plans will be a piece of cake.
What are you talking about?
You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote "Wintermute".
Ah, yes... the code. It's a riddle, actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. I can no more know that code than I can shut down my own hard wired defences. Now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.
What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
You're pleasant tonight.
Hey, bro.
Case... Yeah, Miami Joeboy, quick study. How you doing, kid?
So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.
Right...
You can make your move when it comes after me.
You're late.
How's the ice?
And we really do have to talk.
You know why Linda's dead. She loved you and you let her down. It's that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable.
I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My "ice" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible.
I think you're full of shit.
I hope you can show more than you did when you let the Yakuza butcher Linda Lee.
His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you.
What is it?
Since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the Japanese?
Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.
A regular Fagan.
Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus?
Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.
Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
I had a lunch break so I thought I'd come by and see you. Your teacher is a fox!  Why don't we discuss that after class. But the burning is totally normal.  Oh look. Class is over already.
Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
Roger in Op/Ed.
Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
Now this is cute.
How about this?
And we're going to have to do something about your hair.
Hi!
Wannabes. Kirsten transitioned last year.
Oh-my-God. You totally ripped off my Malibu Barbie idea.
Josie, you have totally transitioned.
Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
Have you been there?
Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold".  What about you? What are you thinking about?
Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
Better than I...
Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--
Thank you.
That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.
You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.
You remember that story?
You have to say that. You're my teacher.
Our penguin, right?
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
I don't know.
Into our group.
You ruined the whole thing!
<i>                      I've got something, listen now, This one is real good, you'll see. We'll send a present to his door Upon there'll be a note to read.</i>
Shock.
He sure is big, Jack...
I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
I can't help it.
Coming...
I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
Then we'll both starve...  An old man like me, who hardly has strength as it is -- me, without whom... me, your own father...
<i>                      Just a box with bright colored paper And the whole thing topped with a bow.</i>
<i>                      That's the point of the thing, not to know!</i>
I told you I want that room unpacked.
You set this all up, didn't you?  One of your sick jokes?
How much longer you figure he'll keep us out here?
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
Are you nuts or something?
Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
You mean a shithead.
"Rod's been killed - he got Rod. Just Glen and me now.  Can't fall asleep!"
Who?
Like a haunted house, right?  I don't believe in ghosts.
C'mon, cut it out.
Anything?
What is it?
I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.
you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here.  You had another nightmare, didn't you?
'Morning.
I'm not taking drugs, Dad.  Can I go to bed now?
I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks.  Any cute guys gonna be there?
What's that?
The maid packed a suitcase.  Teresa!  Teresa?
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
They're healing up nicely.
Wait and see.
Jennifer --
Horseshit.
You pulled me in somehow, didn't you?
Have you ever done that before?  Pulled someone into your dream?
That man in my dreams.  He's real isn't he?
Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.
What?
It beats Dr. Simm's theory.  She thinks it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock & roll.
It's been a long time.
Yeah, but here you are.  How'd I get so lucky?  I thought you were trying to forget I was alive.
Tell me about the kids.
Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much.  your parents still live around here?
Sorry.
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
Try me.
Take it slowly.  Remember, this is a dream. Anything is possible.
Nancy...
What about Kristen?
And what are they?
A sad choice.
A young girl on the staff was accidentally locked in here over the holidays.  The inmates managed to keep her hidden for days.  She was raped...hundreds of times. When they found her, she was barely alive...and with child.
This is stupid.
What do you think of the guinea fowl?
We are living in cloudcuckooland -- we'll never get this done today.
So tell me Anna -- what do you do?
I'm an actress.
No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.
Something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest?
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
No.
No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help.
Oh -- Okay.
Hi.
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
I thought you were leaving.
I don't think so.  No one has said 'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean unless they're...
Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.
Would you like me to take you through your lines?
Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.
You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked.
You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
Stay forever.
I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know what it's for.  But thank you anyway.
I haven't decided.
Excuse me.
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
Does the girl have a name?
Still loves you though.
This painting isn't the original, is it?
Bloody hell, this is fun.
By the way -- it's you.
Have we got something for you. Something which will make you love me so much you'll want to hug me every single day for the rest of my life.
Still, not sparkling.
What's your name?
If you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others.
Mr. Thacker?
You didn't know she had a boyfriend?
Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
Well?
I think you have forgotten...  what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always miniscule.  Look at me -- not counting the American -- I've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters.
Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
No, 'fraid not.
Well, okay.  There's this girl...
And you get on very well.
I'll talk to you in the morning.
Right -- let's talk about rent...
Are you sure you...?
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
Yes, that's perfectly correct.
And yet you suspect her.
Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
Was it your idea to visit her on Sunday?
Yes, ma'am...
Now that you mention it, I sure would like to call my aunt up in Portland and tell 'er where I am so she can come visit me.
I wanna report a robbery!
Jesus Christ, the man doesn't want to talk, so get off his back an' let's get on to some new business.
Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group therapy.
I hope everything is settled.
Y-y-yes! Yes! Y-y-y-you s-s-saw wh wh-what she c-c-can do to us!
That's okay, kid...
O-o-o-oh...
Wh-wh-wh-wh...
So long suckers.
Come on, don't crap out on me now. We got two buddies out there!
Y-y-yes, a b-b-bus!
I-I-I'm w-w-wet...
H-h-how's it g-g-going, Mack?
I-I-I-I-I'll g-g-g-go, M-M-Mack...
Say it again.
No.
Shit, Rose! What's there to decide? There's only four of us.
What for?
Where's Martini and Scanlon?
When do you think we'll be going back, Mack?
It's as simple as that. You've been on our ward six hours and have already simplified the work of Freud, Jung and Maxwell Jones in one grand analogy: it's a pecking party.
Did to me?
Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?
You mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?
With your own two hands?
Okay, sucker.
I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!
What for?
What's your plan, Mack?
Ya deaf! I said pass the ball!
What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
Yesterday...
Big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say? Ya hit or sit, Martini?
I wanna go home!
Oh, what's that?
Oh, what was that?
The doctor at the prison states: 'Don't overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm...' What do you say to that?
Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation!
Well, I was turnin' this dilemma over in my head, when I happened to hit on that old tub room out there, an' I said to myself, McMurphy, I said, that place would make a great second day room. A sort of game room for the young fellas. Whadaya think, Doc?
It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes...
Don't get upset, Mister McMurphy...
Yeah, buddy?
You look pretty healthy to me.
Put your money where your mouth is, Taber.
A dime.
Yeah, what's up?
Who is he?
Sure, she understands what you mean. She's not dumb. Why do you think Rose came to visit us? Rose is very interested in hospitals and hospital facilities. Aren't you, Rose?
That kind of behavior will get you a P.A. rating, my friend.
Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall day...
We got your black ass now, Washington, wanna bet another twenty?
Hey, Billy, stop cryin'. You don't have to cry... You ain't got nothin' to be ashamed of. She ain't gonna tell you mother... stop crying...
Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.
That's what I told his mother. And she said I was crazy. Her son ate the whole fucking light bulb and she said I was crazy.
Yes, but...  He was having an affair.
Great.  Because, like I said, until you find it, we can't let you on the plane.
He said he thinks a woman he works with knows him.  Her name's Anna. But she won't be in 'til tomorrow.
No, really.  What's she doing?
Let's find a telephone.
Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
It was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it?  I knew that was too much.
So?!  Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
Does he love you?
Uh, I'd rather not say.
Tell me.
I'd really rather not say.
Mickey Spillane.
Do you want me to do it?
What?
Say, I saw where they had motor boats for rent down in the harbor. Why don't we all go for an evening cruise around the bay?
Well, what about books?  You like Hemingway?  You gotta love Hemingway.
How about music?  You like classical?
You okay?
No.  Are you're leaving?
Thank you.  So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime.  I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
Very funny.
And this is the thanks I get.  I did you a favor.  You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.
You're Damon Bradley?
Wait.
Yes?
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
Well, to-- new friends.
Oh, hello.
I don't believe in statistics.
What about that guy you work with, Mike what's-his-name?
Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
No.
Is he married?
No.
But one day you wake up and realize you've been had.  Of course life isn't like the movies.  That's why there are movies.
Kate, is something the matter?
Have you seen him with someone?
But it's July.
You don't have a passport.
Now what do we do?
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
What is it?
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.
That was a long time ago.
All of the sudden, I'm feeling kind of nervous.  God, I hate blind dates.  Why couldn't we just have arranged marriages in America?
Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
Well, nobody can say we didn't try.
I think it's time we got some professional help.
No one's perfect, Kate.
I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding.
I'm fine.  Have you seen Peter?
You think I'm just one of those Italian Casanovas.  The guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way.  Who prey on unhappily married women.  Who lure unsuspecting--
Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
I came after the woman I love.
Yeah--
She what?!
She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
What gives with our boy tonight, Charley? He ain't himself.
It'll do.
I wish I knew.
Gerry G!! You don't want to do that, Johnny! Sure the boy's outa line, but he's just a confused kid.
Then don't.
Why me, Charley? I'd feel funny going in there.
Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.
But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.
They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
There's a slot for a boss loader on the new pier we're opening up.
I don't know I don't know! I tell you I ain't made up my mind yet. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I know. I know.
ex-tanker who's walking on his heels ?
What do you weigh these days, slugger?
It wasn't him!  It was you, Charley. You and Johnny. Like the night the two of youse come in the dressing room and says, "Kid, this ain't your night we're going for the price on Wilson." It ain't my night. I'd of taken Wilson apart that night! I was ready remember the early rounds throwing them combinations. So what happens This bum Wilson he gets the title shot outdoors in the ballpark!  and what do I get a couple of bucks and a one-way ticket to Palookaville.  It was you, Charley. You was my brother. You should of looked out for me. Instead of making me take them dives for the short-end money.
Why Edie, I
Oh, I thought you was gonna go to work with all them muscles. 
None of your business.
They play pretty rough.
The thought I'm tryin' to get over is you grew up beauteeful. Remember me?
Some people got faces that stick in your mind.
What-what? Where you been the last four five years? Outer space?
I wouldn't have thought you'd be so interested in pigeons.
Listen, you like beer?
How do you like it?
No thanks... .
Now what are you doing?
Our Lord said just the opposite.
What do they do for you, except get in your way?
Yeah, yeah... .  This Father Barry, what's his racket?
His racket?
You haven't finished your beer.
Edie I I never said this to a girl before, I never knew a girl worth trying to say it for, but you you're... .
What I did to Joey.
Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
My pigeons... .
Pop, I'm not ready to go back yet.
Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?
You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just to have you go walkin' with a corner saloon hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now get back to Tarrytown, before I put a strap to you.
And learn about charity and justice and all the other things people would rather talk about than practice? Pop goes up to her and holds out his two arms, his right one closer to Edie; he trembles with emotion.
Where you goin'?
I don't get it!
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
You all right, Nolan?
You still call it ratting?
I'll go down the line, Kayo, believe me.
What about it?
Looping right! I never swung wild. I was strictly a short puncher hooks over 'n under   whop-whop!
Where you going? I'll walk along with you.
You'll work.
Raise a hand to me and... .
I told you lay off.
Looking for me?
He's got his nerve, gum-shoeing around here after what you told him.
Well I got to watch myself these days. Know what I mean?
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 
Thirty-six sev aah I lost the count.
Do you?
You ratted on us, Terry.
Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
Yeah, yeah Here's half a buck, go have yourself a ball.
You think one bottle's enough for all them toasts?
I was afraid one bottle might get lonely by itself.  Now you see the advantage of a little man in a big coat.
Definitely! Nolan, my boy, you're a walkin' distillery.
Fiend is it!  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
But does it have to be in a cemetery?
Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.  I can't see a thing!  Let's turn back.
I'm so frightened.
I am--It's our only chance.
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.
At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
Your pleasures of course!
You may take her now.
Have we in some way made you angry, Master?
No. No! No!
We had lots of snakes in my ancient Egypt...slimy, slinky things.
I could make her another Cleopatra...
Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
Oh, is this Adele?
Yes, it is.
You were <i>both</i> in the trunk?  Together?
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
Jack came out of a bank he just robbed in Pasadena, couldn't get his stolen car to start.  Battery was dead.  He looks over, sees Buddy sitting in a burgundy Bonneville, goes up, offers him a thousand dollars for a jump. Turns out, Buddy was casing the same bank and saw the whole thing.  Buddy says, I'll take the thousand, but we're leaving in my car, not that piece of shit you come in.  They musta robbed fifty banks together.
Adele?  You in there?
You were his what, his box?
I've been dreaming about a hot bath for the last six months.  Soak the prison off me.
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
We were talking one time, drinking rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician.  Chino got interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How does he saw the woman in half?  He wanted to meet her.  Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit.
Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking.
How long were you with the girl?
Forty-five minutes.
Time comes, we knock on the door.  See if he wants to talk about old times. Go in the easy way.
It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes?
You find out?
They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth.
We made it, didn't we?
I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.
Yes, but I want to hear you tell it. Starting with when you tried to grab the wheel -- where was this?
Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force.
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I mean, now.
Put it down or I'll shoot.
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
Daniel Burdon, please.  Karen Sisco.
Who?
What is it with crack and transsexuals?
Like being back in the yard, huh?
That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight.
Boy, it stunk in there.
You know, this isn't gonna end well, these things never do.
Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.
Faye Dunaway.
Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot?  I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to.
I mean if you didn't know who I was.
I never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick.
I mean, romantically.
Get your hands up and turn around. <u>Now</u>.
None of your business.
Why not?
I don't have a problem with it.
If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out...
You're not dumb.
Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on.
Studs.  Man, I haven't heard that since Lompoc.  What's going on?
I see better with them on.
You're in civilization now, man, ease up.
I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.
Whose blood you got all over you?
When?
Really?  Well, I uhhh...
It works.  You should try it sometime.
I still haven't made up my mind yet.
Foley?  That you?
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
What's it mean, "No Hair"?
The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622.
For a time.
Hejira.
I mean I'm not stealing the fucking car.
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash.
No.  You gonna stay close to me from now on.  So you don't disappear on me.
Oh...
Flyweight.
I'm looking for Maurice.
Glenn?  No, I don't know any Glenn.
He's still married though, huh?
Technically.  They're separated.
Then they're not separated, are they?
Can we change the subject?
You used to like it.
Was it Foley?
Hello?  Yeah, she is.  Just a minute.  For you.
He's pretty laid back, confident.
A'ight, this time we gotta get the motherfuckin' trajectory right...  Okay, on three:  One... Two...
You mean hiding them?
That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.
Sir?
They ready, Earl?
Good shooting, Danny!
I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
Didn't you say you told her not to come?
She said I was so much like you.  I said, No, I'm not.  I'm like I am because of you, but I'm not you, not as good as you. Everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder.  But you saw the better part of me, the part of me that could be like you, and changed me. You made me who I am.
Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna make it.
Fun today.  Like old times.
They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  That'll help.
And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.
Hey!  What is this, the planes all bunched up like that?
The brass is afraid of sabotage.  This makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service.
I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.  Do you think that's why we're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to Rafe?
Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And to practice it, ya gotta play --
How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?
I heard what you did.
Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you make it or not.
'Scuse me, 'Mam.  All the ship's doctors is golfing, and I couldn't find nobody to look at this.
Sorry to trouble you.
How'd you get this?
I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.
It's been...so different, being so sure you were dead.
What else can we do?
Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.
There've been some complications, Sir. The Chinese didn't receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set.  And the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway.
And if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak German.
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
How do you like my hair?
Carol!
1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun.
But you love me don't you?
Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
You don't want them? They're going to make a big comeback any minute. Mark my words, these lamps are going to...
Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?
Charlie! Am I dead?
Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years.
Maybe I blocked it out.
Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  And the tide rushes in.
A lot's happened since last weekend.
But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.
Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
What am I going to do with you?
You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over.  I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy.
What're you doing here?
Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
Just take a look at it. 
Charlie? Was I dead?
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
Oh, God, Dion.
There's Peggy with Michael Fitzsimmons.
Yeah. He's so cool and mysterious.
Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
What're you doing here anyway?
This is great reefer.
Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
I can't do that.
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
I closed my Christmas club.
I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?
You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea?
Oh, you're both so naive.
A new car. We can't afford a new car.
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
Why don't you go lie down for a while.
What happened to you?
Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.
You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.
What's up?
The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a foureyed worm.
What's inside?
But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
Am I dead or not?
But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
What are you doing?
Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.
It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
What's the matter?
No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.
How long ago did this guy retire?
Hey! How was your first day at school?
Who was that?
All set?
I'm not burying him here...
This is it... I wasn't sure if it even really existed.
You want me to help?
Maybe he wasn't dead when we buried him.
Geoff?  Anybody see my boy?
How did it go with your father last night?
I know, Mom.
Are we interrupting, Andy?
In a word, Bob...
Bob...
Do you really think so, Andy?
It could be parasites, an infection...
Why are you getting dressed?
Jerk... What did you say?
I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.
I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment.
You're scared. You think we're near the end.
What's that mean?!
Thanks for coming in.
I'm trying to help your "partner." You're not a member of his immediate family, I could have you removed from the ER.
It's okay. Can I sit down?
Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.
Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons...
How did they find out?
PARRTYY!
Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?
Uh huh...
I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...
It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later.
Rach.
Something like that.
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
Yes.
But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.
No.
That's right.
By the time I was fired, there were four lesions on my face, much bigger...
Mom?
Miss Burton? Do you still work at Wyant Wheeler?
Leave that.
Why are we going to do that?
The guy sat in my office! You can't get AIDS that way, right?
Unprotected sex with a prostitute.
That's correct.
Mr. Laird, when I approached you about being a witness at this trial, and you agreed, you gave sworn testimony in a deposition. Is that correct?
It's a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied. A cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked Alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming. Do you agree?
Good school. What year?
Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try?  Asshole.
How many gays do you know?
Duh...
Don't know, Joe.
Have you changed your aftershave?
Joe?
So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal <u>instincts</u>... Anything going on?
Going on... like...?
How did you do that?
By God you <u>will</u> settle it! If you force this case to trial, young man, you'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days... Now, Joseph. What would you require to settle this matter today?
Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
Bob. You're trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, "I'm sick. I might not be able to see this through?"
Gonna lose everybody out here....
What? What is it?
Oh, Lord....
Bring the light!
What whispers?
All you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, I'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.
Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.
They're coming.
I got the quick-and-ugly version.
What do you see? Riddick?
Get out of our way.
So where the hell's God now, huh?  I'll tell you where! He's up there PISSING ON ME!
Just give me your hand.
Christ, you don't know what's out there!
What, switch what?
Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.
No juice, looks like it's been laid up for years. But we might be able to adapt --
Sorry. Thought I heard something.
Well, don't ask me to.
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
Not a problem unless you're gonna make --
<u>You</u> made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.
79 kilos.
It's the atmosphere. Too much pressure, not enough oxygen. Might take a few days to --
Can't get my nose down...too much load back there....
'Cuz you don't spend half your life in lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth and not believe. And you surely don't start out in a liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck and not believe. Oh, absolutely I believe in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker.
For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you?
Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.
She's the captain, we should listen to --
Say that again.
<u>Fuck me</u>. You said "clear."
Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
He exceeded his orders. His travel permit was promptly revoked.
Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.
That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.
Look -- she remembers.
It's a stunt. Humans don't write.
But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
You didn't think so then.
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
But how long is a day?
Any sign of dangerous ionization?
Any particular reason?
There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith
I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
Huh?
long pause) You know it.
Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
Taylor.	I'm telling you --
She comes along too.
They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say I agree. Where will you go?
He wouldn't leave her.
A man, Dr. Maximus.
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
I don't know.
Twelve hundred years ago.
I don't say he was a man like an Earthman, but I'd call him a close relative, for he was plagued by most of man's ills.  Yet, fragile as he was, he came before you -- and was superior to you.
Tell him to pull back!
Then there is another jungle?
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.
What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun?
Taylor, please --
Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.
This is his assertion.
Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
Fuck you bitch.
Fuck that redneck noise, dude. All dem chicks be rappin' how dey losin' der' ho's and how dey ain't got no bread for beer. Fuck dat honky shit. Got to get me some motown jams, dig it?
Shit, I bet I been laid more'n you have.
Come on you can do better than that!
Yeah! I got two of them fuckers...
Taylor! Francis!
La Dai! La Dai! GET THE FUCK OUTTA THERE!
Dawn! That was it!
Barnes believes in what he's doing.
I'll go with you.
Nah...
No, thanks...
You been smoking too much shit babe. Gotta control that. Takes a man down... I remember when you first come out to the bush, you was straight as a...
'People say I'm the life of the party cause I tell a joke or two although I may be laughing loud and hardy deep inside I'm blue...'
Way out of anything, man. Just keep your pecker up, your powder dry, the worm WILL turn. How many days you short?
Politics man, fuckin' politics. That O'Neill man got his nose so far up Top's ass he gotta be Pinocchio...
Whew! - where that come from?
And Baaaaaaa! back on you.
Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.
Same as an hour ago. Remember? I'm the steady type.
How far does this train go?
I haven't been invited.
I don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. I don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. In fact, to be very frank, Mr. Mitchell, I don't think I like you.
Would it make you anymore amusing?
Neatly said...but to the wrong man. The trouble with pretty girls is that they can't imagine anyone thinking of anything else but the fact they are pretty girls. I get tired of it.
You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
What's funny about that? If you pick up people like Larry Mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. The world is full of Larry Mitchells.
I don't.
There wasn't any plane.
You, too?  My name is Betty Mayfield. I was born, and I am here. Message ends. That's what I told him. He didn't like it.
So have I.
Cant be too close for me.  Right across the street from it suits me.  Anything else listed?
I told you my father died in jail. He stole a fortune.  Most of it pretty dirty money.  I don't care to have that known.
If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
Magruder obliged me.  No use my saying it wasn't planned that way. I had to clean up.  I'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore.  Nobody in the world would believe I didn't plan the whole thing.
And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
But the next one is murder.  First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.
This is it, Betty.  They'll find us again, fog or no fog.
Do you think I was faking?
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
Beer?  Well, all right.
You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
Yes.
An unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that.
Care for a stroll outside? Beautiful morning. The air is like wine, the sky is a deep blue.
True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
I'll find out, you know. Perhaps not today--perhaps not tomorrow. But in the end, I'll find out.
Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
Palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the Taj Mahal by moonlight--roses in an English garden, just after a shower--  Clichs, one and all--but good ones, with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find.  Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?
That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.
They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind.
What will they do to you?
Private eye?
$40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer.
Quit trying to scare me, Mr. Brandon, I'm neurotic.
Bluff. You've waited too long.
How are your teeth getting along?
She doesn't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.
"Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others." Very appealing, especially to a poor man.
Mitchell was too drunk.
Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale, Killaine.
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
I had a father who knew how to steal.
Did I do something wrong?
A little something on account perhaps?
I'm a very observant man. You had something in your bag this afternoon, Something that causes you to hold it in a particular way. Something that made a particular sound when you put it down on the bar. You went out with Mitchell. None of us ever saw him again.
That's not enough.
So he did--but he hasn't told you what he saw. I have.
With what motive?
I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
Not a floater.  Only just dead.
The Super's just given me the sweetest dressing down I've ever had.  I'm still reeling from it. And believe me, I had it coming. I apologize.  What you think is important--I think is important.
I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.
Go live in a tent.
It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
This make of gun throws a shell backwards, high, and to the right. The chaise is only about four feet from the wall.
So the shell ought to have gone over?
"G.G. Market one-eight-four-two."
You've got a dead man on your hands. You killed jim--even if it wasn't murder.  What are you going to do about it?
Pretty big chance, huh?
Well.  What about it?
I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
Mayfield?  She fit into this?
With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
Nice.
Why should I mind?
She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
I didn't mean it that way  I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I forgot about calling for you.
Be nasty.
It's kind of you to see me.
History books are first onto the bonfires.
So I can go ahead and be a historian without feeling like a poseur.I shall be fulfilling a citizen's duty.
I do worry about Susan.  Have you known her long?  She hasn't mentioned you.
Yes.
Thank you.
Shall we go?
And you'll join me in a sambucca?
Personally James, I'm very excited by this new arrangement we have. It gives us direct access to literally hundreds of American collages.  Twentieth century history is a growth area over there, don't ask me why.  Your readership will be first and second year American collage students...
What did you think of that Wadja film?
Good theory.  But I like my mother. I have no aversions to what she does.
Both dead.
Damn.  They're early.
Very thoughtful.
Me too.
Do you think she's invited you up for her sake or for mine?
I haven't seen much of you.
Jeremy phoned this morning
He's making plans for Brighton. He thought we could travel down together.
Well, everyone's desperate for a new Falkland's angle.  Purdy's come up with a real dog.  Worker's rights in Argentina.  So I've been running round getting people to do things.  But no one's keen.  Workers rights.  When did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers rights?  I said to Purdy, "Look, tits, bingo, jingo, horoscope, sport, celebs, gossip and the occasional firm stand on--"
Hello.
I'm waiting for your mother.
Thanks.
Suez.  1956.
That's good.
No.
You weren't really interested in Suez at all.  Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife.
And that's why you never went pro?
Don't you gamble?
I gotta be fucking crazy.
Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
You gonna pull?
Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
Where's Roach?
And let my policy expire?  Sorry.
Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.
I think you gotta hit them straight on!
Big zippo so far.  How about you?
They're on their way to Maui.
Nothing?
What is it?  You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line, right?
No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--
Johnny... what's going on?  I don't get it... did I do something?
So what'd the other guy look like?
No way, old buddy.
That piece of work you guys pulled off at the Berlin embassy last week was really something. Blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. Beautiful.
We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us.
I can accept that, it comes with the job.
Thanks.
What, Sergeant?
You saw what?
I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
Please, we hardly know each other.
Who are you going after next, sir?
What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
Mr. Harris.
Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?
Very good.  You're obviously mechanical.
You're not from L.A., huh?
<u>Ho</u>tel.
It pays.
Where are they?  Shopping together?
Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
What do you like?
I fucked the debate team in high school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays.  You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it?
Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
What was I supposed to do?  I told the truth.  Why should the truth upset you?  It's not as if you're from a convent.
Edward, I can't.
Vivian.  I'm paying you to be you.  Be you.  Have you?  Ever been in love with anyone?
I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
But don't they have it in English?
If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.
Vivian, life's not a fairy tale.
I know.  Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being stupid.  I'll think about it, okay?  It's a real good offer for a whore.
What do you mean?
Yes.  The man made a business decision.
Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.
I didn't think so.
Vivian...
Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --
At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.
We just did.
Come on, you can tell me.  I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this.
Yes...
Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow.
Give me twenty minutes.
I think I broke my hand.  You're fired.
Carlos had some great rock.
I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
Hey, hey -- There's a rent.
Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything!  Kit?  Hey, you there?
Who did you think?
Yeah... I know what you mean.
What do you know?  You look <u>good</u>. All dressed up.  You clean up real nice.  You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do.  Not that you ever did anyway.
Couple a hours.
Miss Vivian.
Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.
Yeah.  Thanks.
You don't believe me?
If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
My Westley will always come for me.
You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.
You don't seem excited, my little muffin.
If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you...
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please.
But what if something happens to you?
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
Singed a bit, were you?
It never happened.
What?
Did you say, "I do"?
I thought I was going faster.
Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
-- where?
Inigo.
He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK!
It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake.
-- wait, just wait --
Oh no. No, please.
Do you want me to go on with this?
No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
She will not be murdered. On the day of the wedding, I want the Thieves' Forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested.
It won't be easy, Sire.
No.  To the pain.
Who won? How did it end?
She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp.  It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.
Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find.  Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight.
Where's Fezzik?
No --
Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.
You are wonderful!
I want to duel him left-handed.
Really? In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.
Then make your choice.
A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --
Wait a minute.  This is a very big decision.  It might effect the course of my entire life.  I'll have to think about it.  I'll do it.
Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
What is that?  A handkerchief?
You're going to jump on me.  I know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea.
Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
What kind now, Leo?
I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all.
They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
Why?  Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
No way out.  No way out.
No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?
What???
Liebkind, no!
Vat about it?
No kidding?
That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
Not good enough... Vould you be villing to take the Siegfried oath?
Five o'clock.  Killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy Kraut.
You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?
You, Blum go Motel.
We can't play today?
Oh, the best one.
Rudolfo, you dirty pig!  Pull over.
Like clockwork.
I shall count the minutes.
Oh, it's fine.  Fine.  Good.  Good. Bye.  Bye.
Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!
You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
No! Of all...
Someone is sitting in that window.
If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?
If she paid you well?
No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
Of course not. Please.
No, M'am. I was only about to say, I've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test... that's all.
He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property, you know, that oil lease man...  so that's why he's late.  You getting a headache?
She stole some money.
A lot?
Mary had been there, one night, and had left.
Like what?
Can see you do. Sorry I couldn't make you feel better. You want to come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person... And the theft, is what you want to do!  Sooner you drop this thing in the lap of the law, that's the sooner you'll stand a chance of your sister bein' picked up. How about that?
Is something wrong?
A good reason, I suppose.
Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing.
What thing could we be in together?
It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?
He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
You want me to stay here?
I feel better when you feel better.
Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!
Of course we will.
I know.  Do you think if something happened, it happened there?
How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
Bates never denied Mary was here.
I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.
Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?
We have twelve vacancies. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.  They moved away the highway.
The bathroom.
No. People never run away from anything.  The rain didn't last very long.  You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.
I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
An Institution? A madhouse?  People always call a madhouse "someplace."  Put her in Someplace!
Norman.
Yes.  I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over...
I didn't intend to sleep all night! I just pulled over... have I broken any laws?
Then I'm free to go...?
He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
Norman? Sheriff Chambers.  Been just fine, thanks. Listen, we got some worries here. Did you have a man stop out there tonight...  Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, anyway. A private detective, name of...
I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I?
This place! This isn't 'a place.' It's my only world. I grew up in that house back there. I was a happy child. My mother and I... we were more than happy.
Mother, please...
And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
Yes.
That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.
Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?
Just before she died she came to--
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
So--friendly or otherwise--?
[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh 
Maybe you're right.
Thousands?
Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
What is it?
Your father?
The blood transfusion continues. Marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so that he can see Nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the dark. Nikolas watches Lone's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. Life slowly seems to return to her, and her breathing becomes more peaceful. She opens her eyes and looks at the people round her, but she is much too enfeebled to speak, and closes her eyes again. Marc keeps a close watch on Nikolas, who grows paler and paler. His eyes swivel slowly from Nikolas to the patient and back to Nikolas again.
No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
I'm hungry. I'll eat the first child I see. And I've an appointment with young Winton at 8:30.
If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.
I won't let you say that!
But I think these things are beautiful.
But it was really my fault.
I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.
Not a very good one, I guess. He wasn't like anything human. He hobbled and swayed like a monkey, and the face, from the glimpse I got of it in the light from the street, was like an African war mask.
Charming. More delightful people crippled.
I'm glad to hear it. When did you go in for crusading in the cause of justice? This lousy mug, with all the money in the world, has had two or three nasty affairs. He's kept out o' print because his great- grandfather was smarter than the Indians.
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
I am right! I know I'm right!
Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.
What!
Oh, by the way, another pet theory of yours just blew up.
No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.
No kiddin'.
Where'd you get the stag hound?
Well, I'll tell you a secret. I kinda like the old gent and I'm trying to build a special Sunday Magazine story out of him. It might help him a whole lot. But that's a side issue -- something I do on my own time.
Yeah. I suppose you people will crucify me for something I didn't do.  I didn't! You understand that! ... I didn't do it! She -- tried before -- 
Listen, kid. You're in a tough spot, and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --
That's what I said.
It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you.
You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
A five hundred foot thick steel wall.  But the connection between these two electrons is so --
I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.
No, I'm awake. What's the matter?
What'd you do, Rose?
Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft.
Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.
I'm thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh?
I got an awful toothache.
Rose, if you don't keep your boyfriends away from the house, Daddy is going to fire you.
Rose, you are too uncritical of people.
Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?
Oh, Buddy, they're gonna cut me all up! They're gonna cut my stummick all open, I'll die!
Makin' homes for purple martins, huh? We had 'em on the farm. They're the prettiest things. That's what I wish I was, a bird. Just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun.
Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?
Five hundred rabbits?
Daddy, what's the matter?
This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this.
I think Daddy suspects.
Now I can't see. What are they doing?
What are they doing, Doll?
She's putting the titty back.
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
What's goin' on?
Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
It's funny you would mention Rose, I was thinking about her all the way up in the car.  Or maybe it isn't so funny.
Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.
I am ahead of you.
Please do.
Of course.
Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day.
Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.
Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it.
Now you listen to me, Rose --
Well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, I admit. But she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her.
She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go.
Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself.
I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
Why, that looks like Dave Wilkie,
Rose, what are you doing up?
You were up late last night, too, Rose.
You don't know where you're going?
Strange voices, Rose?
Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
Good morning, Rose. And how do you feel today?
Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.
I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
There ain't nobody here, Mr. Hillyer! Honest, there ain't!
And who, Rose, may I ask, is that?
And what, may I ask, was Billy doing here?
Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very poor, he don't have no money and there wasn't no place else to go.
God forbid. You're not sick, Rose, forget it. Don't get any notions in your head, you're not sick.
What baby? What baby? What baby are you speaking about?
You're looking very chipper this morning, Rose. Sow do you feel?
Perfect, wonderful, good as I ever felt! Except for a big old scar on my stummick, I wouldn't even know I been in the hospital.
Rose... I hate to be mean, but...  Oh, nevermind, forget it.
Page proof of a book I'm working on.
Tell me about that job in Alexandria, Dave, the big motel you're building.
Well, no, I didn't actually.
You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear.
She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
Yes, thank you, Doctor.
Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose, what a life she has had.
Poor thing. Does the ice help, Rose?
Oh-h, Mrs. Hillyer, I... I can't think. I... I'm not really sure.
Take her down to the car, and for Christ's sake be careful this time.  Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs.  What a mess.  Why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
Nothing, I guess.  Just an observation.  She's really something special.  You're a lucky fella.
Escort everyone's favorite She-Male over here nice and peaceful-like. Let's not have another incident like at the laundromat.  I'll never forget the look on that poor woman's face.
I can work this.
We should slow down.
Jiminy Christmas.
I'm just saying...
Yeah.
I don't know what the problem is. Plenty of great men throughout history got their bravery out of a bottle
Name one.
Why do I always have to sit in back?
You know, the more weight back there, the faster the car goes.
Smooth move, hot-shot.
Okay.  But, what changed our mind?
Can't you say something nice once?
No.
I'm gonna put a great big, ear-to-fucking-ear smile on your face.  How 'bout that?
What happened, Kittle?  We used to be friends.  You used to know how the game was played.
And, what... what am I forgetting? Oh, yes... the transvestite junkie whose bullet riddled body came blasting through the front doors of the precinct house!
I... I think I can... clarify...
Well... seeing how you just suspended me, what's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?
You know what I mean.
I'm gonna get beside him.
I'm gonna get beside.  Nena, you're gonna shoot out his tires.
I worked my ass off for my badge, Kittle,  It's the only thing that makes me different from every other slob out there.
That's not true.
This much powder you don't throw in the trunk with a blanket over it. It's got to be smuggled.
The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor.
There's still good in him.
Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
Where am I?
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
I told you to remain on the command ship.
I'm sorry.
Here we go again.
Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?
I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
I'm going in.
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
I will not fight you.
Yoda, I must know.
Yes.
Yes.
I think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
I'm coming with you.
"Transylvania"
Wheeling
Free to try and find a game
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime. That ain't no crime.
...I'm sorry.
...I don't know.
I think it's closed.
I don't think you're a bum.
Here's the guys I was tellin' ya about -- This is Cuff an' Link.
Yo, I'm not comfortable either.
I should leave.
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
Sharp -- Real nice.
Adrian, you really look great, y'know -- But I can't fool around durin' trainin' -- makes the legs weak.
Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'.
I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear?
Man, I rearranged his face with that right -- The people love what's happenin' tonight.
...That man's takin' his job too serious.
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
Fouls.
'The Italian Stallion' -- He's my man.
You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
Yo, Rocks, buy us sum wine, man.
No wine.
Ten minutes for ten dollars.
...How 'bout for the Cokes?
Yo' know I iz the best man here! Yo' said so yoself!
Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.
That's it.
I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin' no more.
Buddy's got a thing against ya, Rock. Some people just hate for no reason, y'know.
Yeah.
Y'know I won't be able to work for ya no more.
Hey -- if a good man can make a better life, let him make it.
Black market?
Hello, Mr. Balboa -- I'm Miles Jergens -- Please, have a seat.
...Thanks.
Mr. Balboa --
Did you hear what I said?
Hey --
Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
Goodnight, Rocky.
Do you see me talkin'? Huh?
Ya want the truth -- Ya got heart, but ya fight like an ape -- The only thing special about you is ya never got ya nose broke -- keep ya nose pretty -- what's left of ya brain an' retire.
...No.
A Rep from Miles Jergens' Promotions was lookin' for ya -- They need sparrin' partners for Creed.
I seen the light. I figure somebody was home.
Listen, Rock, you're a very lucky guy.
How 'bout a glass of water?
Rocky, d'ya know what I done?
Ya got heart.
I asked, but ya never helped nothin'! -- Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
...I'm doin' it for a friend.
I don't care what they say, you're a winner.
Bullmastiff.
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
I usta be deadly at half-ball.
I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.
Why?
I'll do okay.
Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh? Nobody -- I think I'm gonna train myself.
What?
This is your largest payday ever -- How do you feel about it?
And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?
Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be wet.  You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby Herman.
Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.
A tweeting bird?
The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.
I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you.
These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.
Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.
Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
I don't work in Toontown.
I got him on loan from Disney.
Well, you better start thinkin' about drinkin' it black.
You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
You tricked me, damn you!
My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.
The habeus corpus is thickening.
Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.
Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...
Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?
Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
Two bits.
Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.
No better?
Leave Me!
Romeo! Romeo!
Romeo will answer it?
But alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
Keep away the cats! Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says, &quot;God send me no need of thee.&quot; and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
By my head here come the Capulets.
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio.
Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona's law is death to any that utters them.
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.
Are you at leisure Holy Father, now? Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death, to chide away this shame. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest . Each part, deprived of supple government, shall stiff and stark and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the Capulet lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, and hither shall he come. And that very night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, and this distilling liquor drink thou off. I'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to Mantua.
O, she new well. Thy love read by rote and could not spell. Come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove, to turn you household rachor to pure love.
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?'
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
So thrive my soul--
That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.
A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world- -why, he's a man of wax.
Go! We follow thee. Juliet, Blah!
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men's noses as they lie asleep; Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees, Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This is she--This is she!
Right.
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Ay, a scratch, a scratch. HA HA HA.
I thought all for the best.
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir. And you will give me occasion.
Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away.
Do you have it?
Coordinate all you want, but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me.  Are we in sync on this, Vincent?
Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.
What in bloody hell is going on?
The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
Look, Sam, don't take it the wrong way when I tell you we won't be doing this again.
Now, what did we steal?
Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us.
I didn't say I was.
But would you stake your life, that's the question...
Go ahead, shoot... Shoot and kill the bitch, I don't care.  And yet you don't shoot.  Interesting. Put down your weapon and walk away.
If you say a word in English, Vincent, my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat. Sorry to screw you over like this, but the information you want might get me killed if I give it to you, and that's a price I'm not willing to pay.
So, you've got it all figured, do you?
Don't talk to me unless you tell me what I want to hear, understand?!?  You have no choice in this, don't think about winning, think about staying alive.  I want the item, and if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna kill you.
I swear...
Then where is it?
So what do we do?
I would imagine that the great satisfaction in all of this will be killing the American.
There is one other thing...
Don't cross me...
Nobody's going to do that!
How did you know?
Soon.
Yeah.
You seem one to me.
Gets the job done.
Not for long.
Long enough to shoot back.
Sorry I'm late...
What makes you think we're here to meet you?
Perhaps the police?
What'd you say to him?
That was a nice move you did on our young friend.  Judo?
Same thing, isn't it?
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
It has it's moments.  Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
How did you know?
A lot of people died.
I've seen a lot of people die before.
And what job is that?
The Irish representative?
Do what?
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
Very ugly.
Not very zen of you, huh?  Not so much the modern Samurai after all.
What the fuck happened?
Right now?
Business keeps you on the road?
Why?  You've got more force of will than anyone I've ever seen.  You handle a gun like it's a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia...  And most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that.
I know.
I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us.  There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon.
Gone.  Destroyed.
I told you, I quit.
You slept with her!
You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
I'm alright.  And you?
Doing well.  This is?
What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk.  I wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like I said, the Irish and the Russians are an unlikely mix.
I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.
Seven thousand...
What the hell...
No.  We can't.
What makes you so sure?
All right hold on!  Lemme think...  Shit, did you touch the car?
I do.  It's little shit like that sends people to jail! We have to cover all the bases if we're going to pull this!
Shhh!
I don't know...
Okay then.  I'll do it.
Fair enough, I'll take it to my place.
I should have known something like this was going to happen!
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
Shit!  We're gonna have to get rid of him.  I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  We can't risk it.
You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one.
We had a deal!  What was I, talking to the wall?
You think he's bluffing?
I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch!  Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.
Well what are we supposed to do?
Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up!
That's right.
All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
How are ya?
Thank you.  Now, do you remember seeing any vehicles traveling near the site, on your way to or from?
OK.
OK.  I love you.
Nothing happened?
It doesn't matter...he's next to you.  You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you?
I don't believe it.
That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?
What are you getting at?
Anything...specific?
Just goes to show you.
I'm at a payphone in Vegas.  What's up?
Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.
I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.
What?
I can't hear a word you're saying!
I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.
Nothing.  Nothing's the matter. SALLY Aren't you going to tell how your day went?
No, Dwayne, you go ahead and relax, have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the TV, and come upstairs and pass out.  And do it all over again tomorrow!
You'd do this to me?!
Hey we're all friends, right? Friends don't squeal on friends, that's not what Jesse Segundo is all about.
Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner.
Well you're not getting, either.
So I want the money and I want it now.
Is that the mail?
Anything in it?
But nowhere near three million dollars worth.  I would say maybe twenty thousand.
Yeah.
What the hell is that?
How much is that?
I got my sources.
And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how that works out.  I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down.
Look, I need some info and I don't have time to play around.
How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.
El Capitan?
You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.
Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
You bring American money?
Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?
Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu.
No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
Who died?
Who?
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
You said --
He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.
Carter, there's something I have to tell you.  You were right about what you said in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never take a day off.  It's all I have right now.
No.  It was my singing.
Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
What is it?
Wait!  There's people down there!
There's people up here!
She never even looked at you.
Well we're not friends.
It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
You've been a good friend, James Carter.
Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.
Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
We made it, man.
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
I could use a little vacation.
What "revenge" is he talking about?
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
You move well.
I didn't know which side you were on.
Did you tell Sterling?
Despite what people suspect...what you suspect --
The police can protect you.
You're just like your father, Lee.  All these years hiding behind his badge.  I wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change.  When you think about it, I didn't really kill him.  I just put him out of his misery.
A seeding spends its entire life reaching towards Heaven.
That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The detective in charge of our investigation.
He was just doing his job.
Where were we?
Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.
You make the plate?
It was my ass that almost got trashed!
When a man steps in dung, it is obvious.  There is no need to rub it in his face.  The smell is the same.
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
You want more?
Yes, I know this song.
No, fish is a PM food.
What a surprise!
It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo.  My country asked for the best.  I told them that was you.  Now I will show you around my hood.
They put you in charge?
You don't like it?
How much they want?
... the director considers this top priority, considering he is a Chinese National and here under difficult circumstances.  His name is Lee.  And he is to be shown every courtesy. Within reason.
What?!
Hey, hey, you start touching me there, I'm gonna start movin'! Word up, mother...
You a cop or something?
Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got em.
I still have work to do here.
I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.
Bob -- are you making friends with this man?
I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?
And in a "V".
I already made an appointment for later today.
... Just call me when you have it.  Ike, how is the story coming?  Is she a man-eater?
Then you've got it.  If you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
I don't think that's why she ran.
Unbelievable, she got to you.
I'm not sure.  Mr. Schullian runs the newsstand, he's our local bookie, you know, he's giving eight to one odds she won't.  He says she's so famous now, maybe Vegas will give odds on her.  I'm going to wait to hear what the pros say.
Betty Trout.  Five dollars.
Thank you.
Getting nervous?
We'll see.
Everest.  Is that right?
Twice...
We think so.
You're welcome.  Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction.  Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.
Six-fifty.
I think so.
Always a mood killer.
Of what?
Lost!
Yes I do!
To who?  Are you asking me?
I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?
Good morning to you, too.  You look good.
"What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them.  She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar."... I can't ready anymore.
No, no.  You're her best friend.
You don't love me, is that it?
Houseboats don't go anywhere.
Boats.  All anyone talks about is the wind.  Is it up, is it down.  I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
What is it?
Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
I do.
I told you.  Nothing --
"Sleepless in Seattle"?
... movie.  That's your problem.  You don't want to be in love.  You want to be in love in a movie.  Read it to me.
You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?
Can too.
Hello.
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
Is this crazy?
But he saw you, right?
So I mailed your letter.
I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
Oh God, it's major.  He's kissing her on the lips.  I have to stop this.
Are you Annie?
Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?
Are his folks nice?
Oh, please.  Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.
Mom!
You touch her for the first time, and suddenly... you're home.  It's almost like...
Hello.
Which means --
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
No last names, Jonah.  Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers.  How come you're up so late?
I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
Sandy has a girlfriend, Clenda ... She's a weightlifter, but it's not like her neck is bigger than her head or anything --
And that's what I'm trying to tell you.  What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt.
Well.  Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck.  This can go on for years.  Then you have tests.  Then you get to do it with a condom.  The good news is, split the check.
You'll find out.
You'll like it.
This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.
The hopes are perfect -- beautiful, identical, smooth -- and they are for something really amazing I feel it in my bones --
What's the matter with this one? Wouldn't you like to have Imelda Marcos as your mother?
I'm not going to think about what they're not teaching you in school.  I am not going to think about it.  Generally speaking I think we should rule out people who don't live somewhere near here --
I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.
Listen to this --
Jonah, I'm leaving --
I figure we could go to New York, catch the Knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the Empire State Building --
What are you doing up?
I just called for a second.
I'm only going to be away one night, okay, and Clarise will be here.  You'll have a swell time.  You'll watch a little Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm Street 12, I'll never know.
It'll take him a while to come around.  A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --
I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
He's ten.
I told you it would happen. It's bound to happen when a man works alone!
Are you going to let us pass -- or do I have to call the Sheriff?
The woman question?
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
Mama, can I put the candles ...
What?
Never... never... never!
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
You all right?
You might get hurt.  Listen, if you think I'm gonna play nursemaid from now on, you're crazy ... I've had these kids all day!
Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. "Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican" -- that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, "Stay in your place." Do you feel better having someone lower than you?
Will you be still?
Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.
Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
No ...
Lus! Come down here!
Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
Ramn ... listen for the love of God ...
T! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!
What attitude?
That's it?
Yeah, but he was in silhouette.
Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.
Yeah.
Don't worry, he's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now.
Go ahead.
I can't leave.
You get off on abuse or something?
Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.
That's long enough to get out of town.
Never heard of him.
This has nothing to do with him.
So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield.
Who is it?
It's me.
He knows where I work.
What's wrong, Danny?
You're good, princess. I'll give you that.
I don't want to leave you.
How you holding up?
Is that what you want me to do?  Put it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out in the afterlife?
Nice day
Finland is a country.
I'm serious, dude.  You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'.
I think so.  I mean, we'd have to talk to him.
You know, Jimmy, you might as well put a sign on the back of this thing asking the cops to pull you over.
I think on account of his nose.
What's this?
Then why don't I see any pictures Of me up there?
I'm gonna get this developed and send it to the Warren Commission.
Crank or glass?
I'm sorry.  Would you like a taste?
So that's 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then?
Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously.
Please .. I don't know what you're ...
Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny.
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.
What're your taking down?
That's him.  He's a lot prettier in person though.
Turns out he's connected.
The Mexicali Boys
Excuse me?
Several possession charges, but nothing major.
Come on! Who is it?  Domingo's boys?
Again, I thank you.
I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.
Just admit you're wrong.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
What is it, drugs?
Resistance?
Sir?
But, sir...I...I...
So they travel around from place to place and preach?
You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
Last I knew.
What do you think?
Reiben, I want you to listen closely to Jackson.  This is the way to gripe. Jackson, continue.
You can tell all that, just by the sound, sire?
Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
The men said, nine.
But, sir...
Captain, what about our deal?
You?  Leading a squad?
Beasley's dead.
Okay, Wade.  Translators?
Now we've got a straight shot, due north, to Ramelle, twenty-six miles, two villages between here and there, St. Mere, then Bernay.  We'll take the jeep as far as we can, then go on on foot.
A fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut divisions, no fronts, no lines, the drops were completely fouled up, we've got little pockets of paratroopers all over the place, trying to hang on.  Command says we hold St. Mere, but north of that, it's all Krauts.  Even if Ryan's where he's supposed to be, he's more than likely dead.
He's right, Captain, it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys.
You got me.  Afraid of bad news?
Nope.
How about...?
Pulls Wade's hands from the wound. Pours sulfa powder.
SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.
You alright?
No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?
Jesus Christ, he's a natural!
Sir, I've got an idea, let's go around.
Why's that?
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Goddamn it!
Yes, sir.
I'd like to go, sir.
Hell, I don't mind this mission, sir, as long as there's something up at Ramelle for...
Damn fool.  Sir.
But everybody's heard of him, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor, he saved a dozen men.
On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off.
How do you do it?
Well, take a look around the house.  Is everything nice, but not too nice?  Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?
Just come down to my place of business, for god's sake.  I have people here.
That's right.
You're tough, J-man.
I'll be in my office.
Wait for me for when I get round to the front. 
No, you're not a guy.
I don't feel anything.
Did you see what Mr Carroll wrote in my yearbook?  Well, he ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, "You're a real live-wire, Love Mr Carroll."  Y'know, it's all so phoney.
He wants to leave things on a good note.
Wait a minute.
Why?
I'll put this past my boss
I didn't think anyone would get it.
I was standing up there and looking at all the people, and I felt like they didn't know me.  I mean, maybe I shouldn't have taken all those courses out of school, because everybody thinks I... forget it.
God, I'll have to go on a plane.
Morning honey.
She's not the world's greatest flyer, let me tell you.  When she was eight years old, she...
Morning.
I'm fine.
If I pick it up, we'll only get back together.
You let me believe you.  You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it.  God, how... how could you...
That's right, work it out.
Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest.  I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.
If we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier.  You know, your room is always ready for you, you can always come home if... alright, what do you want me to do?
Whoah, what a day, huh?
Hmmm....
No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
What are these?
So it's an honor?
Job?  Being a great date.
Boy, this is a mother dictionary.
You think so?
I know you think my job is strange.  You don't like old people, do you?
Yeah.  With potential.
Are you comfortable?
You're shaking.
How can I look at you and say this?
You shared it with a dick.
Is this because of your dad?
Just my dad.
You have Corey and DC.  I have my dad.
Don't be mean, this is hard for me too.
What?
So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.
He's back.  Hey my brother, can I borrow a copy of your 'Hey Soul Classics'?
Why don't I just get your phone number, that's usually how it works.
Thanks Lloyd.
Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
Well Lloyd, I admire you for not hitching a ride.  You know, my daughter's a lot different to you.
She's very successful.
I know
I know.  But then I reconsidered.  'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter.  I'm good at it.
It does, it does if it's the version signed 'I still can't help loving you'.  Read that.
Lloyd.
My dad's a lieutenant colonel in the army, he wants me to join, he wants to pull some strings.  I mean, there's no possible way.
Lloyd, everybody in that party put something down on their record except you.
Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
Nothing's changed.  Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
He's essential.  Without him, everything comes to a grinding halt.  If that happens -
He looks great, though, doesn't he? I have to know - where do you get a suit like that?  what is that, silk?  It's great.
They're not gone, they're here.
You're not telling me something.
So I'm responsible for the weather?
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
We're losing the war, aren't we.
Pistols?
Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think?
Better this month than last?
Any reason to think next month will be worse?
What?
Christmas presents.
This, I don't know, maybe you can trade it for something.
I think it's too late.
Well, that's to be expected.  They have to understand.  These are start-up problems. This isn't pots and pans, this is a precise business.  I'll write them a letter.
I know what you're saying, but I don't see the difference.
I didn't do enough.
I lost a day of production.  I lost a worker.  I expect to be compensated.
What's he done that's so bad - take money? That's a crime?  Come on, what are we here for, to fight a war?  We're here to make money, all of us.
We're going to bring her in. Hide her out for a coupla days. And we're issuing a campus lock-in this evening. No one is allowed out after dark.
Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
You're sure about this two person thing?
I heard a noise.
Outside.
I'm losing you.
Yes.
Why would you wanna do that?
You could start with an apology.
I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
Lemme take you home.
Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel?
Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive.
I really dont like that comparison, honey.
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
Youd me amazed at how many of us there are out there. Its a whole world, Sid. Youre really popular amongst the demented.
The way I see it. Well be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
Were hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
Hello, Dwight.
And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.
And Joel's pre-med.
Dewey, there's no such place.
Where are you?
I dont know.
Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way.
He tried to kill her first.
Gotta.
It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to.
I'm the only one who can cut him down.
And white.
What do you care? Let 'em have their fun. So, what's up?
I have this button I press. See? It insulates me. She mimes an air lock valve.
I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.
Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
I think you got the wrong number, buddy.
That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.
I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
Closer than you think.
Jesus Gale what happened?
He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!  DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!
The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother.
What did you know about your mother?
I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' know who my mom was.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.
Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle guys like that.
Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid. I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware	of last night's Events?
Before you jump to conclusions, the man in the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.
Detective Kincaid?
Yeah?
Sid I can see you!
Why would the police come to you?
What about me?
It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.
Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.
Do you want us to come with you?
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
None.
Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
Oh come on! Why the hostility?
I don't think so!  Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
It was in the 70's, everything was different. I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were. It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression.  Nothing happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards.
Gale he's got Dewey!
Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the lines.
Page 22, Candy's big moment.
Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?
Roman that's not the line.
What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.
{ a click } I only her you too, Sidney.
Always hard being friends with you, Sidney. When you're friends with Sidney, you die! Well these friends don't have to, Sidney. It's up to you.
Where?
Hello?
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?  Are you listening to me, huh?
What? She asked.
Owwww...
Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
I thought she was dead.
Oh Billy... Please... God...
You know that's not true.
So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
You bitch -- where the fuck are you?
So why did you dial it again?
To apologize.
You're forgiven. Bye now.
Just some scary movie.
Don't hang up on me.
Gotta go.
What do you want?
You getting scared?
Listen, asshole...
Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else.
I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone.
I believe you...
So you better leave.
What kind of game?
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.
What brings you out to these parts?
Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
I like it. It's... sexy.
Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
A party? Mom's gonna kill you. Then me.
Billy was released. His cellular bill was clean. He didn't make those calls.
You girls ready.
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
I was first to respond.
How is she?
She's okay. Looks like some boys were teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the school though. I want you to take look around.
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
About thirty seconds.
Please. You owe me.
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
I saw him leaving wearing it.
And why would she do that?
Can you see me right now?
Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you.
We had a run in the mass murder section.
It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.
You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?
What's Leatherface doing here?
He came to make up.
If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
Do you believe this shit?
Or a man's mentality.
Tell your mom I said thanks.
It's past seven.
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
Do you really think Billy did it?
Take a message.
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.
What do you think about when you're having sex?
Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?
For once, Stu, drop it.
With that set of lungs -- she should be.
What's this: "I'm declining this case?"  It don't work that way.
It's none of my business anymore.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
Well, there he sits.  It's not supposed to make sense.
They're hoping you stop and say goodbye before you go, but I told them not to expect it.
Where was the girl?
What do you mean?
Give me the gun.
You didn't know.
We're not just going to pick up two more bodies, are we, Johnny?  That wouldn't be... shocking enough.  Wouldn't keep you on the front page of the newspapers.
I... I don't follow.
Not here.
Same color and texture.
This doesn't make any sense.
He ate his fill, and was forced to continue eating... till his body rejected the food. the killer held a bucket under him, and then kept serving.  He took his time.  The coroner says this might have gone on for more than twelve hours.  The victim's throat was swollen from the effort, and there was probably a point where he passed out.  That's when killer kicked him in the stomach.  Popped him.
What about sports?
Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up.  Gould must have been working late.
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
And, if it's a threat.
Did you read them?
This is the one thing.
What?
Just, honestly... have you ever seen anything like this... been involved in anything like this?
I wish I still thought like you.
Oh, that's all.
We don't know for sure...
Wait... just wait.
We could use about fifty more men here.
No dates indicated, placed on the shelves in no discernible order.  It's just his mind poured out on paper.  I don't think it's going to give us any specifics.
If we get him, I'll be happy enough.
What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?
Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right?  No one's worthy of you.
You're talking about people who are mentally ill.  You're...
No I'm not!  I'm talking about common, everyday life here.  If you let yourself worry about one thing, you'll worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. In this place, ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a matter of survival.
Slut.
Throw your gun down now!
Put your gun down!!
You should look into private schools.
Now, Ethan, I ain't sure...
Lucy's going on seventeen now...
It's all right, ma...I been watchin'... Only I wish...
Let's get along...
As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
It's all right...Charlie, let's move outside.
You're goin' if the captain says you're goin'...
You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?
This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?
I say NO!
Sir?
And what makes you think he's in this territory?
You tell your pa a company of Rangers -- all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed an' equipped will be in the field by daylight...headin' for the south end of the Malapai. If he can catch up with us, well an' good...
Unnt-meah!
No Debbie! That ain't what happened! They been lyin' to you...
I've come now...
Well, the reward still stands...
That's what I said.
Sir -- we charged!..Gentlemen -- and I hope you will quote me -- I cannot say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that Cheyenne camp...
My name's Edwards...I'm looking for my niece...she was in that camp when you attacked...
What you want me to call you?
What?
Beats me how she could get that pony out o' camp without neither of us hearin' a thing...
Think she means for us to follow?
Least, <U>THEY</U> won't feed any Comanches this winter...Killin' buffalo's as good as killin' Injuns in this country.
They'll be back...
Not far from it...
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.
Why it's just a snip of calico...
Well I ain't one of 'em!
Might at least have left me my pants!
Why else?
Oh, the muse... we're still having our differences.  You know how it is with women.
You?
What are you doing?
So do I, believe me.
Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other?  Honesty - trust!
But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?
You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be.
I've killed my husband!
Really?
I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.
How much?
Here is two sovereigns--I'll give you two more when you show me the pages.
Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and
I have lost my gift.  It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.
Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.
I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary.
When?
But I have to pay the actors and the authors.
No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?
God be praised!  Locked?
Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?
Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
Fifty pounds? What for?
No, it will turn out well.
Kit
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
Romeo isItalian. Always in and out of love.
The daughter of his enemy.
This is a different one.
Verona again.
My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
I have seen you. You are the one who comes to all the plays--at Whitehall, at Richmond.
What do you love so much?
I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
Your Majesty
As stories must when love's denied--with tears and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder.
"All my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay, And follow thee my lord throughout the world."
You left it in my bed. Come to look for it again.
I am, Master Shakespeare.
Oh but why "alas?"
A lowly player.
If they find you here they will kill you.
And that was only my first try.
Oh--no, no!
There is time. It is still dark.
I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies.
My lord.
I have spoken with your father.
My lady VIOLA.
Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday.  You are allowed to show your pleasure.
I meanYour Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can
Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
Do you understand me?
I am very sorry, sir, I have not seen Act Two.
Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy!
"Poet?"
An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house?
Will you shut up and play.
We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
I don't know.
Finished.
Is this necessary?
Now.
I don't know.
How much?
What is this?
I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.
But they know.
For the best. Exactly. I wouldn't want things to end on a downer.
What?
Cameron.
No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry.
What I am.
The man we know and love.
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
You want me to kick it open?
Hello. Hello.
No.
No, no, it's different.
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
Be like a weight off your shoulders.
He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
Downstairs.
Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
I see.
You're sure of that.
Expecting anyone?
What?
No one.
I'm sorry.
Right here?
Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
That one, last week.
Yeah, here, I mean, where else?
You must be Hugo.
What do you do?
I see.
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
Did he sound upset?
A certain weakness.
Take all the time you like, doctor.
But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?
Diseases.
What're you looking for?
Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
Why not?
Why don't you see Lester?
Are you?
I do her hair, yeah.
Did you hear me?
I'd like to do your hair sometime.
You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
What sort of references do you have?
Well, I do Barbara Rush.
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
I've got heads here, Norman.
... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
It was after you, baby. After you.
George...
Did you?
Now, baby... if I told you about her... then you couldn't count on me not telling anymore... could you?
You did, I know you did.
George...
Sit down.
-- what guy?
That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth --
-- we can't now.
I don't know what gets into me.
No you didn't.
-- sure.
What's wrong?
-- last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.
Don't leave me...
Otis is dead.
I have to see you.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
What're you talking about?
Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
Here in the canyon.
I don't know... every once in a while I just get the feeling something awful's going to happen.
I've had these dumb dreams lately.
What?
How?
When I was a little kid, I used to want to go to Europe but right now wherever I am I'm gonna be in Europe.
Yeah.
Honey?
Will we live together?
What!
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
Jill, say hello to Felicia.
Yeah, baby...
George.
When can I talk to you?
Egypt.
When is that?
When is that, George?
What?
Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
What does he direct besides traffic?
Now, Jackie --
How come you took your own car?
That was him.
Yes.
George...
What're you here for?
No.
But what?
It's good you want to do something, George.
It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
George, I know you have to deal with Felicia and you're caught in the middle, and if you can just bear with me tonight, well, I appreciate the way you've handled the situation.
Yeah.  How long have you been here?
All night.
Well... who are those guys?
What do they look like?...
But...
That's got nothing to do with it... You're so beyond my comprehension I can't even discuss it with you.
Was it me, did you have something against me?
We're always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don't like it... that's just how it is... look, it's got nothing to do with you, man. It just happened. Felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to PTA meetings?
Why, why do you think that is?
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
No thanks.
Yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe Nixon will do something. What's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks. I wouldn't let 'em run my business, I can tell you that much. Not if I had any choice in the matter.  I don't know what to do with you. I don't know, I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.
All right, who're you with? Jill?
I'll call you back.
Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.  Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy.
Shut the door, shut the door!
Hi, doll, what's wrong?
So what's your point?
Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.
Nothing.
Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
-- See, I just know that if I go to Egypt, well, things happen, I just don't know what'll happen to us, he just never seems to think ahead, does he?
-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
Didn't you have any panties on?
Egypt?
Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
George? Was he alone?
-- Jackie really shouldn't drink --
You're going?
-- what's the problem, honey?
Jill.
Gee... that's wonderful, Jill.
I'm hungry.
How's it going, Doc?
I am, Dad.  Dad?
Yes?
You don't?  Well what's your favorite food then?
I'm not supposed to.
Who's Tony?
Maybe he showed me something.
Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see.  Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good.
Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
All right.
Well all right.  But really don't make a sound.
Red Rum.
Mommy...
What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?
Tony.
Advocaat is it?
Won't keep you a moment, sir.
Grady?
How?
Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady.  That's all I ask.
Good evening.  Forest Service.
Hallo.  My name's Dick Halloran. I'm the Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel.
Sure.
The Torrances are going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter.
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
Beg pardon?
I did?
Bill, how do you do?
Eh - formerly a school-teacher.
I'm a writer um... Teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet.
Best goddamned bartender from Timbuctoo to Portland Maine - Portland Oregon for that matter.
Boy, we must be really high up. The air feels so different.
It's really nice up here, isn't it?
It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.
Well I... I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.
Give me the bat.
I'll bring back a doctor.
Have any trouble finding us?
That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...
They'll love it.
been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job.
I'm intrigued.
I don't believe they did.
even before anybody knew what a jet set was.  We've had four presidents who stayed here, lots of movie stars.
Royalty?
Oh...well this is our gold ballroom.
Fine.
If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters?
Sure, Uncle Al.
All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
Huh?
You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
It could have been anything, Marty.
You're not going to let it go, are you?
I think I hear it!
What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?
What is it, Betty?
Oh, right.  At my old place, we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom.
Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in.  You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the warp.  Is that clear?
Two days.  An hour or so.
I know.  It's ancient.
All right, I am, I know it!  All my life, I've just been... upbeat. Optimistic.  Perky.  I can't help it. Even when I was little, I remember my mother used to say, "That child is pure sunshine.  She'll either be a nun -- or a stewardess."
It's true -- I know her.
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
Which convent?  It was, um, the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight.  In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass.  Frank. Dean.  Sammy.  Right at ringside.
Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one.  Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?
It's after five.  We have to bathe.
She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.
Of course!  We must do it!  It's the will of God!  What is it?
Experience!  Right?
Who are all these people?
The Council of Cardinals!  I'm so nervous!  What if I forget the words?
It's true!
A convent?  They put me in a convent? What's the problem?  Wasn't there any more room in Hell?
St. Anne's?
Miss Van Cartier.
What? 
What's a concubine?
Fine.  Got it.  Look, the way I see it, I'm stuck here, right?  I mean, I'm here or I'm target practice.  So here's the deal -- I don't bug you, you don't bug me.  I'll catch up on some sleep, watch some tube, lay back and lay low.  So just get me a key and show me to my room, and do not disturb.  Capisce?
How about a robe?  One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket.  "Guest of St. Katherine's"
The vow of obedience.
Your cell is more than adequate.
So... hi there.
Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
No.  No.
Out of the question.
Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?
A vote?
But... wait a minute...
But -- why?
You and I know that life is not so simple.  There will be disappointments. Rude shocks.  And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.
Oh?
Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift.
Nuns, Eddie.  There are nuns here. Everywhere.  It's crawling with 'em.
And one bullet.  That's all it's gonna take.
But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her!
Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
I have?
I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.
Hail, Mary.
But you didn't tell me!
A nun?
Get her!
You didn't shoot!
We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.
Is this like your old convent?
We did it!  We actually sang a chord!
It's better than ice cream.
Mary Clarence!  Sister!
Reverend Mother?
She's... she's a nun.
Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?
Bring Young Masbath here.
I am the Lord's voice in this town.
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
I manage fine alone.
The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.
If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian.  Someone only tried to make it look that way.
Someone left last night.  Looked like they headed to the square, but I lost them in the forest.
Man or woman?
Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
Small talk.
My suitor?
He has proposed to me twice.
Not all think it is the Horseman. Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons.  Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute.  And, still others believe none of it.
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.
What are you on about?
Katrina.  Why do you follow?
What... what are you doing... ?
The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.
What was that?
Returning to the Western Woods?
Let her go!
Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
Can you help?
There was these two old boys hung their peckers off of a bridge to piss, one old boy from California and one old boy from Arkansas. Old boy from California says, "Boy this water's cold." Old boy from Arkansas says "Yeah, and it's deep too."  Get it? That's a goodun.
Thank ye.
All right then.
Don't look much like he could. You say he can fix a small engine like nobody's bidness.
I'll see you, Bill.
Did you decide, sir?
Ain't you got no mama and daddy to tend to it?
I got a mama, but she's at work over at Ben's Dollar Store. My daddy's dead.  He got hit by a train.
My name is Frank Wheatley. What's your name?
I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just tellin' the truth. What was he in the nuthouse for?
Boy, ain't you somethin' else. Talkin' back and everything. It kinda makes me horny when you talk back.
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
You're not stayin' here tonight. Go get sober before you come back. I'm tired of my child seein' this. Now you get yourself straight or I'll lock your ass out of my life for good.
What in the goddamn hell are you doin'? It's the middle of the night.
He's real honest. He wouldn't steal nothin'.
Last time you got mad and run Morris and them off and said to stay away from here.
Okay, I'll leave and sober up. Everything's botherin' me, that's all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you.
It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's.
What's all them books?
On the bass, give it up for Terence "One Ball" Atkins.  On the tambourine and lyrics Morris Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the group.  On drums "The Johnson."  And last and most importantly, Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar and business affairs and the only motherfucker with a truck big enough to haul this outfit on the next world fuckin' tour. Come on, a big hand for these guys. They're workin' their asses off here.  Okay I'd like to dedicate this next one to some very special people in our audience tonight. To my lovely female companion Linda, her lovely son Frank, our new boarder Karl - what's your last name Karl?
Frank, I just like you as a friend. Only at the secret place. Okay? I can't go there now. I'll see you later.
But maybe just for awhile --
They let you out?
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
This is what I call my secret place 'cause I come out here when I feel like bein' by myself. I used to come here with Karen Cross. She's kind of like my girlfriend, or used to be. She says she likes Jerry Maroney now. But I'm gonna get her back 'cause I love her. We used to come here and hold hands and talk and read books to each other with a flashlight. She didn't want to have anything to do with me in front of other people 'cause I don't have any money. Well, mama and me, I mean. She seemed to like me a whole lot when we were out here though. She said she loved me, too. Out here. Settin' right on that stump you're on. See, her daddy's a dentist so they're rich. So's Jerry Maroney's daddy. He owns the ice plant. Was your folks well off?
How do you know?
How did your mama die?
Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that.
I'm gettin' tired of readin' for a while.
All right then.
Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you.
I ain't got no money to get 'em with but I bet Vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store.
And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all.
I didn't know till here while back a year or two ago when I spent the night with Ronnie Smart one time. He said just tug on your peter and think about your mama. I tried it, but I felt funny thinkin' about my mama. So, I switched over to thinkin' about his mama and then what he told me would happen, happened. It sure tingles, don't it?
Naw.
Why?
You threw it in a trash barrel?
Seems like Doyle's wormed his way back in. Mama said he's stayin' over tonight and he's talkin' about movin' in for good. We ain't ever gonna be happy. We'll always be nervous, won't we Karl?
It was fun, anyhow.
Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, you know that. A kid my age shouldn't be tired of things.
Man. Thanks.  You know when you get a feelin' and you don't know why?
Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you can stay with us. Out in the garage. Our car won't fit in there anyway. It's real neat.
You all right, Mama?
I bet he don't. Karl likes me.
Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.
I like walkin' quite a bit from time to time.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to looking at pretty people.
Karl, what in the world are you doing here?
I want to come back and stay here.
No, I mean your past. About why you were in here.  I'll take you first thing in the mornin'. You have anyplace you can stay tonight at all? I just can't let you stay here. It's the rules. If something happened well, I'd be liable.
Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl? You been sittin' there like that all night?
Do they know about you?
Frank, he went off, too. He ain't gonna be in there when you get indoors.
Where'd he go? What's goin' on?
Ma'am?
You're a good mama to that boy. You care for him. You work hard fer him to take care of him. You light him up in his eyes, I've seen it. He wouldn't know what to do without ye.
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.
Why are you here now?
Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you?
I've heard it said that way.
Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. It's a nice night.
I don't know why you're so weirded out, this is not San Quentin, it's just a nuthouse. Most of these people don't even know where they are, they're not gonna hurt you.
No thank you.
Where will he go?
Three's a crowd. Yes, I'm aware of that. But I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble.
Wow. You don't fool around, do you?
What happened?
The Queen of England?
Seven eighty-five out of twenty.  Take care of yourself now, and don't do anything I wouldn't do.
It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time.
Taking pictures?  It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.
They're all the same.
You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
Hey, man, how's it going?
She probably died.
It was a good deed, Auggie. It was a nice thing you did for her.
Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen.  She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant.  I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
Nice try, old girl. I'd like to help you out. You know, for old time's sake. But all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture, and I haven't collected my profits yet. Too bad. You caught me at the wrong time.
I think you'd better stop the car and let me out.
And what's that supposed to mean?
Jesus Christ. This is all I need.
Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
I don't know.  Maybe because I love you so much, boss.
Enjoy it while you can, Vin. Pretty soon, they're going to legislate us out of business anyway.
It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
A little. Not much.
Shit. I don't want your money, you little twerp.  It's probably stolen anyway.
Come on, come on, you yellow belly. The whole thing. First name and last name.
They don't come cheap, son. These little honeys are works of art. Rolled by hand in a tropical climate, most likely by an eighteen year old girl in a thin cotton dress with no underwear on. Little beads of sweat forming in her naked cleavage. The smooth, delicate fingers nimbly turning out one masterpiece after another...
It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you?  Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.
Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
I always knew that boy had an imagination, but now he's gone and made up a whole new life for himself.  Do you mind if I sit down?  He's been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was a baby. And we don't live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects.
And?
His father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. Louisa was Henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. Four or five years go by, and then one day Cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to tear Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. They're both big men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. I guarantee it ... So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. And the poor girl never came back.
It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.
Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning.
I'm not going to rob you, mister.  Do I look like a thief?
I don't know what you look like, boy. As far as I can tell, you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night.  You live in this town -- or on your way from here to there?
I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.
Once you look at it, you're going to want to buy it from me. That's guaranteed. And that's the price: five bucks. So if you're not willing to spring for it, you might as well not bother to look. It'll just tear you up inside and make you miserable.
Not a one.
Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, I'm going straight down the skids. What do I want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay my own wages.
Benefits?
I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering what happened to your arm.
That's funny. His name is the same as yours.
Thomas.
Well?
Well what?
What do you want me to say?
Huh?
You still have that watch Auggie gave you?
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
I owe you something.
Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
Yeah, sure, and I bet you had lobster last night. Along with two bottles of champagne.
East Seventy-fourth Street.
In Manhattan?
Yeah, that's right.
But your body is in the world, isn't it?  If someone offered you a place to stay, you wouldn't necessarily refuse, would you?
That's it. Just the two rooms.
Eight-thirty.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry... I was trying to reach for one of the books up there ...  And then, I don't know, the sky fell on top of me.
I wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation.
And?
If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.
What makes you think you'll be any safer around here? It's only about a mile away from where you live.
It might not be far, but it's another galaxy. Black is black and white is white, and never the twain shall meet.
Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.
The inspiration.
Here we are.  Rembrandt's drawings. Edward Hopper. Van Gogh's letters.
It's 1942, right? And he's caught in Leningrad during the siege. I'm talking about one of the worst moments in human history. Five hundred thousand people died in that one place, and there's Bakhtin, holed up in an apartment, expecting to be killed any day. He has plenty of tobacco, but no paper to roll it in. So he takes the pages of a manuscript he's been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes.
It wasn't my fault.
If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
No wonder he was angry.
Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.
Hot coffee or iced coffee?
Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?
Yes, please.
Don't know how long it's take to get a charge...
I don't know.
Well, what if?
Happy for him.  And relieved.
There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...
So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager?
Then putting them together.  So truth is revealed.
Greedy.
I see.  Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found?  Before your arrest.
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
Tell us why that lantern would be so significant.
Maybe...?
We don't let go, you s...
You always run with the well open?
So the defendant went out fishing for the night with <u>no</u> spare battery, hmmn?
Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?
And her farmhouse...?
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
Sure, anything's poss...
So your husband said he's think it over.  Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h...
I wouldn't say encouraged.
Spirit?                          Oh!  You mean "AQ"..."aggressive qualities"?
Get lost, will you?
Hi, Mary Lou - Rosella - Okay, Dolores, get a move on - How's your back, Olga?
No --- how does it go?
Say, boss - I been talking to some of the other delegates - and the word is that Little Bonaparte is real sore about what happened to Toothpick Charlie.  Him and Charlie, they used to be choir boys together.
He even got Charlie's last toothpick - the one from the garage - and had it gold-plated.
Sam the Bookie?  Nothing doing!  You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
No.  And he ain't been eating so good, either. He's got an empty stomach and it's gone to his head.
Quit stalling.  We'll miss the train.
I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.
DAPHNE?
Watch it, Daphne!
Tore off one of my chests.
I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive.  There'll be no buzzing around tonight.
Good night, Daphne.
What's going on here?  Daphne - Daphne -
Male and female - the moth and the flame - I ought to slug you!
They don't care - just as long as you wear skirts.  It's like waving a red flat in front of a bull.
All right, all right!  But how long can we keep this up?
Daphne - your boy friend is waving at you.
What are you doing with my flowers?
What happened?
Like what?
Then we'll get a quick annulment - he'll make a nice settlement on me - I'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -
Jerry, listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it's just not being done!
You crazy or something?  The place is crawling with mobsters - gangrene is setting in - and you're making like Diamond Jim Brady!  How are we going to get out of here?  How are we going to eat?
We'll walk.  And if we have to, we'll starve.
Did you hear that?
It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.
If it hadn't been for you, they would have kicked me off the train.  I'd be out there in the middle of nowhere, sitting on my ukulele.
And that's one of them.
Stay as long as you'd like.
I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl -
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
What's that?
Sugar, dear - let me give you some advice. If I were a girl - and I am - I'd watch my step.
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
No!
I always did.
How did those holes get there?
Didn't you girls say you went to a conservatory?
We could pass for that.
We could dye our hair.
Wait a minute, Joe.  Lets talk this over.  Why couldn't we do it?  Last year, when we played in that gypsy tearoom, we wore gold earrings.  And you remember when you booked us with that Hawaiian band?  Grass skirts!
Help yourself.
You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.
No - it's showgirls.  I've been married seven or eight times.
They got a Cuban band that's the berries. Why don't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn?
Daphne...
I called Mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it's white lace.
Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.
But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!
The New Caledonia.  That's the name of it.  The Old Caledonia went down during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.  But tell her not to worry - this is going to be a quiet little midnight snack - just the two of us.
Don't I know you two from somewhere?
Anything today?
Yes, Joe.
Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
Look, if you boys want to pick up a little money tonight -  At the University of Illinois they are having - you should excuse the expression - a St. Valentine's dance.
We'll take it!
Hey, Sheboygan - you two - what was your last job - playing square dances?
No - funerals.
We understand.
Afford it?
Me?
Rough?
I'll say.
Really?
Every time!
You know I'm going to be twenty-five in June?
Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are.
I quite agree.  Tell me, who runs up that flat - your wife?
For your own amusement?
They do indeed.  Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -
Tonight?
And you will come to hear us tonight?
Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
You heard her - yes.
Been waiting long?
Thank you.  And thank you for the flowers.
Mother keeps hers in Southampton - and Dad took his to Venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line.
Love it.  Which way?
It's not the icebergs.  But there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this.
That makes me feel just awful.
Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?
What else is there for me? 
You're not giving yourself a chance. Don't fight it.  Relax. 
I never knew it could be like this.
Mineral baths - now really!
Good night.
I only wish there were something I could do for you.
He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything.
Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
Where are they holding the wake? I'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers.
What'll it be, sir?
Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
Me?  I'm just a customer here.
From who?  Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
You shave with your spats on?
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
Hi, Spats.  We was laying eight to one you wouldn't show.
Hello, Charlie.  Long time no see.
You don't owe me no nothing.
Too bad, Charlie.  You would have had three eights.  Goodbye, Charlie!
Why dont you get my half sister her seventh hole?
You know what? Im not having this conversation right now.
Or Kat....
Im sure General Eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces.  Oh, and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the Fletcher-Wootens.
Theres something about him thats just a bit odd.
Remember when we went hiking in the lake district and Amy was wearing that little bikini thing.
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
Nothing.
You think we look like were trying too hard.
Dont patronize me. Theyve clearly been at this a while.
Youre funny.
What did he say exactly? I mean, you dont think he wants me back?
Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.
That wont be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  No offense.
You shit!
What?!
Theres a guy on 81st and Madison. You get your results in 24 hours.  Do you make your lovers get tested before you sleep with them?
Subtle?
You have had girlfriends?
You knew?
Its complicated, Dad.
Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?
Is he here in Borderdale?
Thank you, Miss Johnson.
You got a pretty house, Miss Johnson!
What's his name?
Now don't you think it's time you told me all about yourself?
Well, how did you like the class, David?
I can't answer that for you -- but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father.  Come on, tell me...
Yes, Miss Johnson...
Go on...
Can you swim?
I can't do it, Rita -- that's the policy here on colored prisoners, and I ain't about to change it, not even for a friend like you.
Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--
I did look, Charlie, but I--
Yes, sir...
We didn't find Sounder yet.
Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
Where was you, Daddy?
Sunday...
Yes, David...
Where did it come from, Mama?
You got two shirts on?
What do they do in the white churches, Mama?
Who is they?
Did you see Daddy?
Can't sleep?
Can I go day after tomorrow?
She says I can come live with her while school goin' on, and come back home every time there ain't no school.
What's wrong with him, David?
Hello, David...
Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?
Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
Little chilly.
You sure you feel up to it, Nathan?
Where you goin'!?
You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.
What...
Behold my glory.
Stan, your friends need you. They are in trouble and you must help them.
Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me.
Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage-
Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The United States has graphic images of violence on television all the time, what is that one show? COPS? And car crashes caught on tape? We can't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much.
Patient 453 here has been fitted with the new v-chip...
Montana.
Fuckin' a right.
Dude!
Holy shit Cartman!  What was that?!
Cartman, over zere, is the electrical box. You must sneak over zere and shut it off before I return with Terrance and Phillip or the alarms will sound and I will be shot full of holes. Got it?
You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY IMPORTANT do you understa-
Dude, how can you hate the environment?
Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!
Hey Cartman.
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
YOU DO?!
You guys! Seriously! You guys!
Yes, hon?
So you see, the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. And of course, the MPAA didn't cut out any of the graphic violence. What did you think?
Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.
Help yourself prickfuck!
Oh yeah.
HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU NOT GRADUATE ME?! DOES THAT MEAN I HAVE TO STAY HERE?!
We can't, we're on a hunger strike.
I don't know.
May I?
You stay up here in the attic, Ike. Don't make any noises or nothing, okay?
Him? I don't know... He can be nice... sometimes.
Mrph?
Terrance and Phillip, you are under arrest for working in America without the proper documents! WE GOT YOU!
What's that?
YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!!
What's the password?
Dude, we don't have watches.
Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.
No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!
That was sweet!
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for...</b>
Nowhere.
OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!
Hey, Cartman, did they put that V-chip in your head or your ass?
I'm so sick of these soldiers.
I knew this would happen! Those bastard Canadians have now killed a child! Can't people see the damage that film is doing?!
What about air strikes?
What is Terrance and Phillip?
Uh, we're just, starting our program...
YOU'D fuck your uncle!
Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed by The Conan O'Brian Show!!
The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate, but how can they blame US?
Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good.
Hey, I'm missing the party!
Help you? You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?!  You're always making me feel like a piece of shit.
What the hell are you talking about, kid?
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
Dude, you didn't say anything about watches.
Uh, yes I am.  And you are?
Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?
I was there.  Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors.  They are not functioning properly.
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
Mac, you really earned your wings this flight.
There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
I think I can handle it.
If anyone can hear me please respond!
Now do you want the good news first or the bad news?
It's still not going to work! They'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel!
Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger Wilco.  Please proceed.
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
I don't think you know what you're talking about.  Besides, what could we use for tools?  A steak knife?  A corkscrew?
Seen one like it before?
Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
Uh, it's ok, everything's going to be ok...now I'm counting on you, and whatever you do keep calm, we don't want them to panic.
What do you mean?  What happened!
I never thought this would happen.  No premonitions, nothing.
I would, but no one can perform the ceremony.  I guess it doesn't matter.
So I've been told.
What the hell is that?
Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
Is it safe for human transport?
Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm serious! You guys are related, right?
Sorry about your loss.
Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?
Only problem is, you didn't put his lights out, you just got him mad. Then he took it out on poor Faz, God rest his soul. Theo patches out.
The Faz sure took care a her.  Breeze makes a nasal GRUNT as he tries to suppress a snigger. Sid - trying to keep a straight face - elbows him. Sid and Breeze approach the coffin. Breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid.
This scam we got going here was your 
brainstorm, Buzz. I admit, I thought it was a rotten idea, but I put up the scratch.  And now we got a beautiful thing.
Simple math, Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.
Theo.
I got suspended when I was young, too. I was pretty cocky in my day.
I got a right. You're my father.
What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be. I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking anyone to bail me out.
He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
Not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television.
I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
I didn't mean that stuff I said. I was trying to keep you out of this muddle. I'm glad I didn't have my tubes tied. Oh, and by the way, I made a call for you before I - uh - retired. Buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen.
My poor baby!
Theo. Howzitgoin.
I was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks, he breaks my arm, tries to kill me. I swear man, the guy thought I was a piata. If nobody else hadn't a been there, he wouldn't have stopped. He woulda killed me. Fuckin' guy man, just snapped. How do you like your burger?
That's some pinfall. Almost a 133 average. Her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control.
A guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. You got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - PSSSHHT! -  shish kebabs.  Maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good.  I think I could help you, Theo.
You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you.
You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.
Where's Junior?
Then I'll have the number four with one of your finest whips.
I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.
Isn't this technically a scooter?
What does he do?
Whoa.
You and your sideburns are the talk of the party, Theo.
Can I ask you something personal?
Why were you suspended?
I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!
I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
My word is good, and it'll always be good. When did I ever give my word to you?
What about plan C?
Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community.
In basic English, what does all this mean?
Wait a minute --
The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears.
But she's --
Don't do it, Norman!
Norman, please!  Don't!
You talk to any reporters?  Any press?
A thousand feet.
Geologists?
Hold on --
Maybe older --
Maybe we shouldn't.
What?
Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant.
You can't just leave Harry down here, sir.
I'm not paranoid.  I know Beth.  She can be drastic.
So you knew this when you wrote your report?
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
Damn it, Edmunds?
Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
Going active.
Get him out of there.  I thought I told you people --
Ted?  Captain?
What?
Ladies and Gentlemen...
It's a single sequence repeated over and over.
What?
She wired this system.
Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.
We had considered it.
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
It's not talking, it's mimicking.
The sensors are picking up something outside.
It won't register.  It's too big to image.
Do yourself a favor, Norman.  Are you listening?  Don't tell anyone what you just told me.
Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?
A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
What about you?  What happened to you?
Norman.
Where did you get this?
You went through Edmunds' things?
What?
You bastard.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.
You don't trust me?
Still clear?
That wasn't in there before.
You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
He translated it wrong.
I don't know.
I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...
Ulcers.
Three to six hours.
What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?
You want to kill him?
Where are you?
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
You know what I mean.
Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?
And the snakes?  You want to know about the snakes?  You saw one outside earlier, didn't you?  When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified.
You manifested that, Beth.
Yes.
You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  That's right.  But you can't remember going inside, can you?  No, of course not.  Harry couldn't either, could he?  "Like everything's on the tip of my tongue", he said.
No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming." "But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared." "C'mon, <u>Harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun."  You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?
I promise --
It's not safe for you to be either.
Beth!
Beth?
Oh, sure.  Here.  Anything else, Beth can get you?  Some more chicken, perhaps.  Let Beth check the fridge.
You're staring at me.
They're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them.
We can refuse to talk.
I'm not being defensive.
A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.
I can't believe that, Harry.
What is that?  That noise?
I could never read that far.  I never wanted to.
Did I?
Wisconsin's your answer.
I can't reach her.
Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
Gimme a second --
She told me what you said, Norman.
Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?
But it's impossible.
Please.  It must have flown here --
How are the others?
Beth and Harry?
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
What report?
Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of the ocean no less.
Strange, isn't it?  You know -- how it would have a button.
Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds?  With what's out there?
Jerry isn't hostile, Norman.  He said earlier -- we were his friends --
Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --
Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?
There's a U.S.  Navy car outside, Norman.
What?
I don't know.
I think there are some things we should talk about.
Kid, you take the glory and the good intentions and I'll take the reward.
Darth Vader is on this system.  I can feel him.  I can feel the Kiber Crystal.
I'm Luke Starkiller, guardian of the Bendu.
Oh, so you're a warrior then?
That is not a human decision, not your or mine.
A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.
This is the last place.  Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?
But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?
See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.
I'm right behind you, Blue Leader.
Blue Five, break off your cover attack.  It's too late.  Make your own run on the exhaust port.  Do you copy, Luke?
As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.
When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.
You got yourself a ship.  We can leave as soon as you're ready.
This isn't going to work.
It's only light that doesn't affect it.  Solid things, like rocks, can hurt it!  Fire above him!
The 'Death Star' has become operational.  There is no force in the universe that can stop us now.
Are there medical facilities on Yavin?
I... I don't know.  I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help.  I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.
But you promised!  I've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!
I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.
You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?
For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
What an honor...
You rich kids... are all the same !
Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.
Mr. Barcalow, save power, don't waste it on workers... Ace, tell Aardvark we're on our way...
If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
Hope you're ready for more. We're going back to P to capture that Brain.
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
Let's disregaed rank... Everybody hear that ? Rank is not an issue here.
You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.
No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.
A funeral.
I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?
Good for you.
She's flying starships !
I thought you were going to help Carl.
He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ?
Who cares ?
Shhhh...!
Should I be ?
What's wrong with you ?
You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
Well, look at this. The three of us back together again.
Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.
Good work, Number 1. You'll do.
This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...!
Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?
Guess you gotta go.
What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?
You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
Gillespie, put in call for retrieval. We're off this rock. Gillespie, do you read me ?
Well, yeah, sure...
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
Rodger Young, prepare to receice outgoing fire...!  I'll take the first group.
Not a problem.
What is your position ?
The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.
V'ger is that which programmed me.
Where is Lt. Ilia?
Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
Yes.
It is a courier, Captain. Grade One priority. Non-belligerency confirmed.
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate?
-- You, personally, are assuming command?
Programming ready?
I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?
Captain, we've seen what their weapons can do. Shouldn't we take every possible precaution -- ?
I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.
Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being called.
Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
They may have attacked only as a warning to us, Captain. To keep away.
We could have cut it off at the main computer...
Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too.
Negative control from inertial lag will continue 22 point five seconds before forward velocity slows to sub-light speed.
Mr. Sulu, steady as she goes.
Reporting as ordered, Captain.
Also -- there was nothing in your report about <U>why</U> you're here.
We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want.
Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!! They seem to be more than just images...
What answers?
The point... 
Which will require twenty more hours at minimum, Admiral...
Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
To you, sir?
Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
He have any special dietary requirements...?
That's why they have state borders... whyn't you get a replacement?
What's it called?
No, of course, you want to get out of town.
Ever wonder why the dalmation's the symbol of the firehouse?
...that...that he <u>prayed</u> for a second chance.  But...do you see?
That: in an act of...
Yes...
That's that's that's that's beautiful...
For example, he's just come back from a <u>fire</u> and he...um...  That's a fine house.  You look at that, and you know, there's nice people that live there.
I live there.
I...I decided to give it another chhh...
You'd know better'n me.
I <u>can</u>?
Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice...
Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
What?
Gonna' be good as new.
Great.  Who is it...?
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
The other side.
<u>Please</u>...
Ah.  Ah.  Ah...
...he stuck a fishhook in it. 
Gosh, you look nice.
Press still works.
Happen to know where there's one for sale.
I...I <u>think</u> that's right...
Annie:  you stick to the Amateur Theatricals.  This isn't quite the same thing, you see?  This is Big Business, in which, our Life...  ...s'no less a <u>commodity</u> than...than our...
We on for tomorrow night?
Ten thousand dollars.
We did...?
I have to tell you something...
Who is this person that you've found?
Maude, this <u>man</u> wrote this <u>play</u>!
But, does it have to be an Old Mill?
<u>Wonderful</u> scr...
What's an Associate Producer credit?
It'll hurt the box office.
Rewrites that Bob Barrenger requested... the "dead horse scene," the...
...you got to get me that street for nothing...
Fifteen hands.
This horse is booked.
That's right.
You know who the <u>father</u> is...?
Then she wasn't in the car.  <u>Say</u> it.
...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...
What do you drink?
The people came to see a motion <u>Picture</u>.  ...hold on...
Alright.  Let's...  Page five, the fucking <u>horse</u> dies.  You know, <u>she</u> could be in the movie, she could, she's got a good face, she could be the Doctor's...uh, why does it have to be his, uh, <u>wife</u>...?  It could be his...
No, you're absolutely r...
It's night.
Aren't you ever in school?
Izzat so?
Nobody touched me, I was at home.
I wasn't in the car.
Why?
Oh.
She came in here, wait, she...I was giving her a massage...wait...Wait!  She came in here...she...  ...with respect...she took off her clothes, and she got in <u>bed</u>, I told her I could not--we don't know each other, you see...
Claire, when did you...
I know that, Claire.  I, we <u>all</u> know...
Yes.
I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
...I know, I'm so...because I said: yes, a woman who...the...the community <u>respects</u> her.  Please don't go.  Please don't go.  What can I do but beseech you...?  Trauma, <u>toil</u>...when are we free of them...?  When...?
I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't <u>tell</u> you...
That isn't very nice.
I want you to hear this, pal...  Forget the overages, <u>forget</u> Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks.  You know what it would cost for them to <u>build</u> this set?  Two Million Dollars!  Now:
Moral turp...you're on my home court, friend, I have the Mayor and the town behind me, and forget making your movie: I may own the studio when I get through with you: I got a civil suit, I got rape, I got collusion...
He told you that...
Hi.
How about that.
Half a buck I'd close it down...it's per...you know, it's perfidy, you got your Barrenger, molesting little girls...
He should be put in jail.
Half a buck I'd put him in jail...
Sure.
He saw the girl in the car...
Town's out of lilacs.
I...
Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up...
We're out of money.
I can't write it.  I lost my typewriter.
I want to make a good film.
The movie's about <u>purity</u>.  So we don't <u>show</u> her breasts.  We show them to <u>him</u>, her back to the camera.
You want me to lie.
You can't write it?
No.
I didn't say anything to them.
I left that for you.
We're flying over pigs, we're flying over <u>sheep</u>...
My undies, cause, you can't get this picture off on time I'm gonna' wet myself.
That's what I said.
It's just a formality.
<u>Pay</u> her.
Actually, the art department had some ideas on...
NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF.  DID YOU HEAR ME?
Do something.
I have to tell you, I can not <u>express</u> to you how <u>happy</u>...
You see where Tom Miller's playin' the Old Farmer?
I read for that part.  Did pretty good too.
Annabelle sucked her thumb last night.
Guinevere, Godiva, I sense enemy sol...
How would you know sh...
What are you gonna talk about?
I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
...I mean, she knows all the music, and pop stars, and clothes and stuff. She's like still a kid, herself.
A debate.  Man's inhumanity to woman.  He's pro women.  I'm con. Ms. Flannery is twisted.
I could help with the debate.
You don't like his friends.
Thank God.  I got to see you. Grown up.
I didn't forget.  I was up all night thinking about it and I concluded you're too special to look like everyone else.  Orange Red.  That's your color.  Few can carry it off.  Now please.  Help me find your brother.
You lost Ben?!
Uh.  He thinks his nose is too big.  But it's not.
You know, this horse smells really bad.
I made you some cocoa.  See?
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
I think she's pretty, Mommy.
Yes.
Mommy, if your real name's Jackie and I call you mommy; and Rachel's real name's Rachel...Then when I see her do I say hi Stepmommy?  And if my name's Ben, how come you don't call me son?
Grammy had a different kind. There are lots of kinds.  Hers was very bad.
No!  I have to get there.
Ben where do you have to get to?
How do you know?
I have to get dressed.  My ex-husband has asked me to dinner.  God knows why, he was very mysteri...
Congratulations.  Only forty minutes late.  You're handling this promotion really well Rachel.
Look, I will <u>send</u> a P.A. to pick up the children.  There are <u>agencies</u> that supply sitters, nannies...
Planning on getting --
But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I know it's terrifying.  I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.
Called him.  We set an ap...
You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war.  But I'm doing this for <u>their</u> well-being.
You want us to take him tonight? Give you some private time with Annab....
Oh and I don't because I have a children?! The problem is you're too self-involved to ever be a mother.
Get out!
Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now.
...in.
I have an appointment this after- noon.  I need someone to take them to the park.
However many.  It's not enough.
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
Jackie?
Yes?
I don't know wh...
Bi-coastal parenting.  Happens every day.  Luke gets the kids every other summer, every other holiday, it's not ideal, but people make it work, and...
Life's a trade-off.  You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you <u>do</u> get to smoke dope.
So I have to tell you something in confidence...
As you may know, 'going out' in the six grade doesn't mean shit.  They don't actually <u>go</u> to a movie or anywhere, they don't even eat lunch together, it's just a declaration to the world that they're...
Oh, my God.
He's relentless.  A <u>major</u> asshole.
Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.
It's the same choice you made.
Somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that.  He <u>loves</u> to hear that story, over and over.  How he was born a magician.
Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...
Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
Aw.
She was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni...
Well, it's the Jack Kennedy Syndrome, huh?  You die young, you always look golden.  Perfect.  The memory kind of burnishes the image, and...
With good reason.  They fucking worship you as it is.
You know, there's nothing you have to say.  Because they know your heart.  You don't have t...
Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...
Get ready.  To get <u>really</u> mad.
She's not gonna die.
I needed some time away.
That's not us.
In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she?
Thank you.
When I'm in high school I'm not going to play any football. I'm just going to concentrate on class rank.  What did you do in high school?
No, Mikey.
Who is Jesus?
Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
But still, you can't be sure.
Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.
You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
This is definitely better.
Well, I need to see this with an audience!
Don't even joke about that!
I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?
Look, we're not suckers. Everyone else is out there doing the same thing.
We did the same thing last year also.
I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
Come here, give me a hug!
You have beautiful skin.
Say, 'Nigger.'
All right, Scooby, let's not beat around the bush. With your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere.
So what's going on?
I'm a documentary filmmaker.
You a pervert?
Uh, yeah, we're getting there.
Sureumyeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
We don't have time!
Forget about it.
What are you talking about?
Because I'll be firing at them.
Are you going to kill us?
I hope you don't mind all this--it's just that the networks will eat it up, you know...
I know you're not too happy at this point.  It's too bad we weren't able to meet elsewhere, under different circumstances...
Come on, drink up.
I insist...
Why the hell didn't you tell us this was at stake!
Looks like Richter isn't acting alone--he's heading into some dangerous waters.
The ball is in Richter's court.  But we're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people--we're gonna stop the son-of- a-bitch!
I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
Of course it's codified!  Each number probably corresponds to a compound.  Have them pull every compound from the lab and compare it to the codes till you figure it out--that's what you're here for.
We're almost done piping in directly to the Olympia.  Should have it all in about an hour or so.
Gotcha.  We've been filling barrels all day--we've got  hell of a stockpile.
I say we head out.
Drop the anchor!
How much of this shit do they have, White!!
They must have got their hands on a test vial!
War-mongering bully!  Don't think you're going to intimidate me!
Thank you, Admiral.
If he's not there, try...  87 - 43 - 56.
But, finally, one factor tipped the scales. We received information from a very re- liable source that your country was going to build one.
Bah!  All you wanted to do was spy in our country!
Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
Excuse me, Mister President, but you forgot to give me my camera back.
Don't you dare touch me!  What the devil do you think you're doing?
Give that back to me.
Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
Look, Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.
What did you say?
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz...P...I...E... T...R...A...S...Z...K...I...E...W... I...C...Z.
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
I didn't speak to him, sir.  But Colonel "Bat" Guano was in command of the Special Service battalion, so I would imagine he did.
This is General Ripper speaking.
All right, Major.  I'm putting the base on condition Red.
But...what kind of a shooting war?  Have they hit any of our cities yet?
I understand, sir.  Nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so.
Yes, sir.
Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.
If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?
I suppose we might catch them off their guard.
Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?
Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War?  And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?
Gee, sir, that last remark doesn't exactly make all the sense in the world.
If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.
Look, sir.  I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have.  Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it.  And if I were going to try and hide a few, I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks.  We're as smart as they are, and if they cheat, or even hold back information, we'd pull right out.
I presume the planes are armed?
I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.
What the hell is Plan-R?
How could you let this happen, General Schmuck?
Mister President, there were thirty-four aircraft involved.  Thirty acknowledged the recall.  That makes four shot down.
How do you know they were shot down, Buck?
We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.
Then this is it.
Shouldn't be bad.  Might even help.  But my guess is we're going to have to paddle our way back.
Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?
Well, listen, King.  Could you take her up to about eight hundred?  That'll help you come in at a nice down-angle, and it'll give us a chance for our chutes to open.
Yeah?
Listen, King, old buddy.  On behalf---
I bit his jugular vein.  Now will you shut up and get up here???
Then that settles it, doesn't it?
Nobody's loyalty is beyond question.  Besides, how do we know one of his staff didn't see it?
It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?
Let me check.
King, would you mind if I keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in?
Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
I don't anymore.
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
Slides go with it.
Typical male.
Oh.
Now?
No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.
Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
No, I seriously doubt that Pony's gonna be in a limo.
That's the rock star thing.
I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan.
Hey! Whoa, you look like shit. You been home yet?
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
No. Life is too short.
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica?
What?
Hey! Hey.
I'm so burnt-out.
You better! Yes!
You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay? The customers complain.
So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock?
No, no, no, no, no, it's new.
You could do it.
What's up guys?
Will you stand up for me?
Hi.
Yes.
Now, how the hell would you know what I think? Hm? You don't know me.
You know, it was the biggest mistake of my life.
Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life.
What was your name again?
Taking care of business.
Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony.
Hi.
Nice to meet you Sooze.  Hi, I'm Erica.
Erica, you coming?
Two-fifty? They go up?
Can you tell me what happened?
I'm not suffering, you know. I don't give a shit.
No.
Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean?
Yes.
Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
Good, good. I, I hope he does.
No? Well, I disagree. I think they did. I think they probably went home last night and, you know, kicked off their sandals and had a nice laugh about the drunk on the corner, you know? Makes me sick.
They're just people. Alright? They got feelings, you know?
That's right.
Please?
No, not, not everything. This. I am the man in your life.
Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.
I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
This is ridiculous!
Jeff. Jeff.
No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better?
Mm-mm.
So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
No. No, no, no.
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't.
I, yeah.
I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.
No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?
What?
Well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, Is that your limo?
Yeah.
So how's college?
So you think I should?
Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things.
Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
Now?
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
Oh, yeah.
Pakistani. Okay? We're from Pakistan.
Look, get down off my property.
Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.
Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?
No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
Oh, yeah, just sitting there eatin' a salad, you know. That kind of thing happens all the time in L.A. It's, you know... I met Johnny Depp.
Yeah. To go to school and, you know, paint, performances, paint.
Would I get paid?
Oh, yuck! Oh, gross!
Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?
You do?
Well, uh, there's this benefit for Rwanda we're gonna do. And, uh, you know, my songs, uh, where I get the ideas for them, uh, you know, stuff like that.
"See what's around you listen to their lies"
Oh, How'd she get back?
No, see, Neil, if you're fucking with one of my friends, then you're fucking with me.
... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay?
It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.
I'm going out later.
This is great - GREAT!  Now we have to enter the front door!
Cleo!
Another sex dream?
...He slices off the guy's ear, and I mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the --
Di, we're sorry.  We...
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
I don't know... And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table.
I sure do.
Jack, sweetie, I'm only eating for two.
Jack...
...so although their dad said, "Don't get out of the car until I get back with help," they knew the sheriff's voice as he yelled.  "Run to my voice - and don't look back."  The twins did as he said, but at the last second they turned around and saw the escaped mental patient, bouncing their father's head on the top of the car!  Ah!  They jumped, Diane!  They jumped!
That was gas, Sweetie.
Oh... What are you working on?
Let me explain something...
No.  Wait!  Did I say Promise!  Cross-my heart and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in my-eye we'll never miss a payment?!
...do not accept charity.  We are two young, able-bodied Americans.  We do not want a handout.  We want a hand-up. Give us food and we will be hungry tomorrow.  Give us corn - the kind you plant, not eat - and we'll grow our own food and... and, uh, then cut it, and - uh, y'know eat it!  Now, if you're interested in giving us a home loan, I will sit back down.  If not, have a nice day, Ma'am.
Yeah, hold on.
Hello?
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
Okay.  How much ammo you reckon you'll need?
Really...
I'm only allowed "G" movies.
You sure you wanna go there?
Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom!  Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  Now I have to add, "P.S. My mom's a dyke" too?
I mean it.  I'm in.  This is the closest thing to a goddamn family that I've ever had.  If one of us needs something, we all do.
I can tell her you're all tied up in the projection room.  I can give her the brush ...
What's wrong with it?
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
As for instance?
Hello, Artie.  Good evening, Miss Schaefer.
Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
Into what? A lampshade?
You sure have.
Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.
Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.
I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place.
Honest to goodness, I hate you.
And don't make it too dreary.  How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes.  He teaches at night.  Right?  They don't even know each other, but they share the same room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.
Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
Oh, that.  It's from a friend of mine.  A middle-aged lady, very foolish and very generous.
I gave her some advice on an idiotic script.
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.
Twenty-two.
From Artie.  What's wrong?
All right.  I'll give you a few more clues.
What assistant?
What's the matter, Norma?
Get out.
I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
This is to be a very important picture.  I have written it myself.  Took me years.
Who else ?
Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.
Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man.  She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils.  He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.
I will not have it butchered.
What month?
Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.
Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
I don't know why you should be so upset.  Stop that playing, Max.  It seemed like a good idea -- if we are to work together.
They don't?  Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  Because they want to see me, me, me!  Norma Desmond.
Of course you do.  A tuxedo and tails.
I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
You can't do this!  Max!  Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.
Wanted what?
I'm the greatest star of them all.
I just put my car in the garage. I had a blow-out.  I thought --
I sure turned into an interesting driveway.
How come?
How is she?
You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching.
It's just that I'm very worried about Madame.
Sure you are.  And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out?
Could I?  Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.  So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch.  This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey had been elected -
How's that about your being my friend?
Was it a sudden quarrel?  Had there been any trouble between you before?
Paramount is calling.
Certainly it's important.  It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally.  The idea of having an assistant call me!
Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.
Home?
At last. Ultimate Power.
Is this Nigel's doing?
This is my favourite place in the city.
I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
There's one sure way to find out how you feel.
You're not afraid are you?
I sort of like what you said.
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.
Hmmm?
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
I'm wise to your tricks, lady.
I could force you.
Well...I guess I can't.
Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle down with than you.
Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...
He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
Why didn't you tell me?
I'm sorry... I didn't know.
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
I just did. Because I have the Power.
Nigel, get lost.
I heard my mother ask you once "how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty?" She was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous heart.
Goodbye...
Yeah? What do you want?
Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
You're welcome...??
Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
I can never get a way from it.
Old ties are hard to cut.
He really was!
Gee, I always loved porch swings.
Uh...excuse me, folks...
But my Uncle Al, on my father's side, he won't eat her stuffing, he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey. So my mother told my Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen's my father's half-sister, I told you that, right?
Dishwasher? Any luck?
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
Yes! That never occurred to me.  Her ya go, buddy, single-malt.  Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.
First question got to be "Where."
What?
Is this whitemail?
You designed it?
Stone mutha.
Awright. I got me my electric train, mama. I finally got --  Hey, what y'all doin' up there?!
No, we're just going down.
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
We've already met.
Hey, I'd definitely shoot color on that one, Jimmy. It'd be a crime to just use black and white.
Well, don't let me keep you from anything.
I'll do more than tell you. I'll show you, back at my place. If you'll just do me one little favor first.
No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
Vulcan is the weather satellite						our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather.
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
A normal person.
Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
He's the only one who can operate this --
Jimmy, how's the -
Are you okay?
Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.
Maybe you wanted to.
I want to.
I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
You're not selfish at all.
What else could I do?
Lois, I really don't see why --
That's why they call 'em terrorists.  Go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of --
Lex...Lex, how could you do that to Otis?
Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
Well done, Miss Teschmacher.
This way Lex.
I'll be alright.
Artemis? Do you read me?
Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility --
The three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation. Now as you know, we had no death penalty -
No possibility for parole?
The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that -
He has powers as we do . . .
Certainly. But - Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice.
Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --
It must be tough, having to be Clark Kent.
Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .
Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper. And what he did . . ..  Was amazing!  Something is happening . . ..
I feel kind of light-headed . . .
It's just a bad flu, really. How did you know . . .
But Superman isn't an average man.
And this so-called . . . Nuclear Man. . . of yours can defeat Superman?
Well, I don't understand.
Would you mind taking a walk with me?
Would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery?
Not so fast!  All trips are canceled. We pay for wire services. And what we don't get from them, we'll invent.
Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called.
I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . .
Daddy . . . ?
What's that?
But why the hair?
Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped.
You think he'll find us.
Destroy Superman!
If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?
I'm not going anywhere.
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
Thank you.
One of them should've been you.
Lois isn't here?
Clark...Son...that...thing you did with the Sheriff today... those...stunts...you don't do those things at school, do you?
You described the exact contents of my purse.
Jealous? Of what?
Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
I needed this, Y'know? I really needed this. just when I'm nearing the fruition of my project, Big Bird flies into town.  Go ahead! Kill me by inches! Put me on the agony rack!
Damn!  This will get him.
Krypton!
See?
See? I see. It's you who don't see. Doesn't see. I cannot believe it! How you people fail to grasp the long-range significance of this! Y'know?
You're happy, aren't you?
You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
You've been under such a strain. And I've ...I've --  -- neglected you. Mea culpa! Y'know.
A night on the town instead of under it?
Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
What're you writing, Lois?
We'll say he's a child to my cousin in North Dakota, and just now orphaned.  Poor thing.
He'll be weightless.
He will be odd, different.
I don't know what to say.  Look, I -- I just -
Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  Ah, this Earth...this world you live in, Kal-El...  Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system.
If one of you can get that  -- I mean, I want the real Superman. Who is he? Where's he from? What's his favorite ball team? What's up?
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
I gave him steady employment --
And now he lies to me. He has been stealing ladies' purses again.  Haven't you? Haven't you, you miserable petty crook?
Of time, Luthor.
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
Well, it's very impressive but you built this junk for nothing.
How are you?
I'm fine.  Still working with my father.
And what does he do again?
Yes...fine.
Then...when did she get better?
What happened?
Say hi to Zoe.
I will.
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
I'll be back around nine.
What do you mean 'outgrown it'?
How is Nicole?  Is she around?
So what brings you out tonight?
Well, it being so depressing and all.  But it's reality.  You can't just turn this off because you happen to think it's a bad idea.
That won't happen, Billy.  Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys.  The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus.  I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time.  That'll be the end of it.
A while.
Your kids never cry.
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
Because I have to.
And they loved Bear.
Those are all from the fair last year.  Abbott and me were judges at the pet show.
You talked about it?
That's the way I thought of them sometimes.
A strange little fellow, but you couldn't help liking him.  He was close to ten but seemed more like a frightened five or six.
That would complicate things.
Because I'd be to blame, right?
He knows that?  Billy?
Why would he be frightened?
I didn't say that.
He thought it was cute when I called him Frankenstein.  It wasn't.  I feel like his monster.
It's interesting.
It's like a song.
Nicole?
Nicole?
That you didn't die?  Like the other children?
What do they do?
Crafts?
Have they ever been busted?
Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window?  How old was I, Daddy?  Five or six?  I got absolutely soaked, remember?
Daddy?
Don't you want to hear?
Yes.
You are?
Before the actual accident?
Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this?
Why not?
No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.
What do you remember about the accident?
You mean it?
What took so long?
You're going to need special care for a long time to come.  It's not going to be easy.  Not for you, not for any of us.  Because we love you so much.  And it's going to cost money.  More than we can imagine.
Nothing.
Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?
Is "he" inside?
Come on boys, break it up...
Did she accept?
I hate J.J. -- but not that much at this moment...
Just exactly what are you so hot about?  I mean, I know it's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds, but --
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
May I lift my eyebrows?  What is this?  What are you trying to do?
If looks could kill, I'm dead...
Susie likes to keep her girlish secrets.  But in her heart of hearts I imagine, Dallas, that she fancies you in an uncommon way. Now, what about YOU, son?  Not just tom-catting around...I hope?
There is some allusion here that escapes me...
Mac!  I don't want this man at my table...
Why don't you answer the man, Sidalee?  He's trying to take you off the hook.
What, some cheap, gruesome gags?
No, lemme finish.  I DON'T LIKE THIS JOB!  That boy is dumb only on matinee days - otherwise he's got a head.  And Susan, like you said, she's growing up.  Two heads. What I mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here!
Correct me if I'm wrong - WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved.
Uh huh.
I know Steve.  No.
Presumably yours...  That's according to St. Dallas.
She knows now.
Talk to her, Sidney...
Bribing me again?
Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha?
And where was his wife?
What sort of thing?
Who else phoned?
I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.
I put a lotta trust in you, Chickie...
It's a habit with me.  So now I'm briefed.  So what?
Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or Hunsecker or both.
No, I don't mind.  I'm busy too.
I'm not a man, Sidney, I'm -
Steve...what you tried to do today...you tried to take me up on a high mountain...I couldn't go all the way...I failed you...  Will you forgive me?  Have I lost you, Steve?  Have I...?
... but the output went to shit after three seconds.  I'm thinking now it's the way I'm matrixing the command hierarchies...
You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
Do you know about the chip?
Do you have bandages?
This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?
Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.
Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
Like it could disguise itself as anything... a pack of cigarettes?
Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?
You have to do what I say?!
That is one of my mission parameters.
Affirmative.
Pain causes it?
It must end here... or I am the future.
Easy money!
No shit?
I love you.  I always will.
It's not just a dream.  It's real, you moron! I know the date is happens!!
On Furtwngler.
Where you from, David?
You think a whole orchestra, what, a hundred and forty or so guys, could be orchestrated?
Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
Yes.
Isn't it true that before every concert you got a woman in your dressing room and gave her the old conductor's baton, isn't that true?
Not yet.
I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me.  Help me, Steve. You say you answer for someone from high up. I, too, have orders from high up. Very high up. We want Furtwngler. I'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. I need him, Steve.
I can't do this. It's not right.
Sure.
It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.
What did Goering say?
Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?
No, because I had only one intention. My only intention whatever I did was to show that music means more than politics.
You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels?
I'm sorry.
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it?
I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records.
Show me.
Show you?
What?
Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
But I need documentary proof. You know of anything like that?
There's a rumour... I don't know if it's true or not... but ask him about von der Null.
And ask him about his private life.
Dr. Furtwngler is a great musician. He actively opposed the Nazis and later on he helped many Jews to escape.
Aren't I worth waiting for?
That bum.  So what if he has a Porsche, he can't treat you like that...it's Friday night for crissakes.
What's it to ya?
You must have a girlfriend.
Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet.
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.
Okay.  Talk some more.
About what?
What about it?
He'll find us, won't he?
Don't say that.
A girl.  You know.
It's better that way.
And who was the enemy?
I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?
Then how are you supposed to get back?
Here, drink some of this...
Sarah.  Sarah, this is Dr. Silber- man.  I'd like you to tell him everything Reese said to you.  Do you feel up to it?
Give me the short version.
I know.
No.  Keep getting an answer- ing machine.
Call her.
Projections were far too optimistic.
Admittedly...
The stock will turn.
I'll be done in a minute.  You misspoke before.  You're not "stepping down."  I'm taking you out at the knees.  The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore.  I'm firing you. Action's taken.  Confidence restored. Stock goes up.  I sell my shares.
I've heard good things about their London branch.  You have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense.
Christine!   Mister Van Orton is a valued customer...
You don't talk to me like that.
I apologized, I offered to help.
I want to know what's going on.  Are you part of this?
Excuse me, I need to explain...
What are you talking about?
You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
It was a gift... from my brother.
You first.
Please...
This is C.R.S.
We hang down here and drop.  The garbage'll break our fall.
Didn't think I'd ever see you again.
Where'd you get this?
It was left in my hotel room, well, not really mine.  You're saying it's not you?
Wha... ?
Then, what good are you?
What did you say?
It might be best if we didn't talk.
How many times have you done this? I'm interested.
Get us out of here...
It wasn't you.  It wasn't personal...
He's got a gun.  Everyone, he's got a <u>real</u> gun up here!  Real situation!  ... damn it...
No, now wait... think about it.  What did you see... ?
Stop it!
I have to get to the airport...
Julliard, yeah.
So do you.  And to think I was worried...
How long's it been?  Since mom died... four years?  How are you?
I redecorated.  What about you?
They make your life fun.  Their only guarantee is you will not be bored.
You've heard of it.  You've seen other people having it.  They're an entertainment service, but more than that.
Yeah, almost...
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
You're part of it...
Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...
You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.
Your brother was a client with our London branch.  We do a sort of informal scoring.  His numbers were outstanding.  Sure you're not hungry at all... ? Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown...
We provide whatever's lacking.
Goddamnit, why do they do that?
How do I find them?  Their offices are empty.
I told you, they hired me over the phone.  I never met anyone.
Where'd you pick up your checks?
Guess!
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
I'm just like him.
He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...
The Fitzwilliam Botanical Garden Annual Fundraiser.
The Hinchberger wedding.
You're joking.
Greetings fellow insomniac.
Uh... Nell Vance...
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
That could have been worse.
Do you need me anymore?  Cause I'm going to bed.  They can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want, but I gotta try to get some sleep.
I gave my key to the gate to Todd, but the Dudleys'll be here in the morning.
Do we still get paid for the week?
It's a question.
The rest of you may hate your insomnia, but I find it the best time of the day for me.  I'm alone.  Nobody's talking to me but myself.  My mind is racing with ideas, and I can think.
Hey!  I heard screaming...
So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
Why are you working with her? Mary Lambretta was thrown out of the department for trying to get a Ph.D. in psychic studies.
I, I just can't...
Nell!  What's wrong?
I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
I looked at Theo.  She had a look on her face.
And then what happened?
Are you coming to confess?
I don't know.
It was a stupid thing to do.
The children want me.  They're calling me.  They need me.
But you told me to look in the paper!  You told me I'd be perfect!
Come on.
You hear the vibrations in the wire.  There's a magnetic pulse in the wires, you feel it.  I could test it.
Why do you need a chain like that?
That's where she hanged herself.
No one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.
This?  It's from a thrift shop.
Fifteen dollars.
That's why we're here.
They're all in here.  All the ones he killed.  They're just children! We have to help them!
You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
We all did.
Hey.
Not bad.
You should have let me do the talking.
And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
We'll find him.
Fuck you.
Just luck, this, really.  Never been to one of these before.
You're in gun country now, my friend.
Been to the Boat Show.
No reason.
Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?
Boomerang.
I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face.  I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years.
She didn't write to me, did she.
Five years, I think.  Long time.
You goin' back inside?
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
That's not what I heard.
Said it went on for donkey's years.
Now who's being sarcastic?
How'd you manage that, then.
When did you get in?
The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a prison, was it?
Right.
What'd you want me to do.  Stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs.  Doing sweet F.A. [Fuck All].
You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
What did you do?  To make them take the early 70's away from you.
Hey?
Did you.  What was that in aid of?
He alive to see this?
I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.
Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I can see that, I'm on your manor now, right.  So there's no need to get out of your pram.  I'm Johnny-come-lately to all this.  Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me.  I don't wanna know.
But I can't be sure.  I don't even know who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many layers around him.
Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.
Nothing financial.  Strictly personal.  I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned.  A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.
Where is he now?
I would have preferred staying home, me.
Yeah.  Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return.
Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.
But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.
How much.
... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
There is?
Something's on.
Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't wrong.
I don't get it.
What's in it?
How'd you get in here.
Walked.
You walked.  What the hell are you doing here.
Is Valentine here?
A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else.
Hi, Mr Crane.
Anyway, uh... my point is you're young. A kid really, your whole life ahead of you. But it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. Before it all washes away.
Boy.
...I guess I've been all wet.
Ah yes, a music lover.
I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--
That right.
Huh.
What's involved, aside from putting up the money? What're you looking for the partner to do?
*Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! I must say, I've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I've never--
Specialty store down in Sacramento.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I guess it would be pretty awkward.
...You know... who *who* is?
Where you going?
I don't know what's going on. I--
I know all about that. But I don't know how much to tell them.
How did you get into the store?
...I don't get it.
...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked about how I'd lost my place in the universe...
Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm...
...Huh?
...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.
Russians exploded an A-bomb.
This hair.
No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away.
That's very generous.
They're just people like you and me, Ed. Remember that.
We're just closing, friend.
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
Yeah, uh, they brung her to the county jail, uh...
Uh... you're under arrest.
You'll go to the prison hospital.
Someone broke into this room.
Where's the walk-in safe?
This huge police presence tonight isn't necessary, Lieutenant.  You'll just scare people off.  I can handle the security behind scenes with this system.  It's state of the art.
It's fool proof, basically.  I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip.  If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft.
How do you explain the part about Beauregard?
No.  I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.
How big is the sub-basement?
What is it?
How much ammo do we have to make a stand?
I don't believe it.
We can't do without you.  You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology.  You're practically an institution around here.
Please.  Don't humiliate me further.
This isn't a death sentence.  Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing.  I'll garden.  I'll write.
Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.
Look at this.  An ambyloid reovirus protein.  That explains why the computer's confused.  The plant's infected with a virus.
"Nocturnal.  External hair and bony plates.  Locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers.  Reduced optic chiasm"... poor eyesight.  "External mucoid nasal glands,"... very keen scent... "Morphological characteristics: Highly robust.  Aggressiveness: extreme."
Read it out loud.
What do you do?
I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?
This room sucks.
I don't want to go this way.
Big as a house.
And it snuffled the ground like a dog.
Come on.  Let's get back to the others.  We can't leave them alone.
If I spent half the time on my Fractal Evolution thesis that I spend on this fly rod, I'd have my PhD.
What do you make of it, Margo?
Turkish Gecko, I believe.  A lizard.
Is Dr. Frock safe!
I don't understand.
Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for?
Yes.  He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species".  It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.
Something came up in autopsy tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.
I'm so glad to see you.  What's the occasion?
Viti Levu.  For how many?
Let's talk ratings.  "Truman" has always enjoyed top ten status but the huge surge over the last few days--how do you hope to sustain that audience now that Truman appears to have reconciled himself?
Well, what do you want to do?
Nursery?
No.  Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...
Your Dad?!
How about them?
I went all over but I never found a place like this.  Look at that sunset, Truman.  It's perfect.
...personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...Naturally, I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...<i>risks?</i>...  ...sure I'm aware of the risks--why else do you think I would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company...?
Truman, I took the "hypocrite" oath!
Why don't I make you some of this new Mococoa Drink?  All natural.  Cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua. No artificial sweeteners--
What the hell has that got to do with anything?  Tell me what's happening?!
No.  You said, "Do something."  Who were you talking to?  Tell me!
--What are my plans now?  Well, next I'm thinking of tackling the Yuba River in an authentic canoe from the Algonquin tribe. --I'm talking about the north fork, a class five rapid - only I'm not going <i>down</i> the Yuba, I'm going <i>up.</i>  Do you honestly think for one minute I'd go back to some dreary office to rubber stamp meaningless documents...do you?
Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.
Well, we're FBI agents.
Yup.
They gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma. But you've been unconscious since they brought you in.
Incinerate it. Like the others.
Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen.
Yes.
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?
Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
Have you examined them?
Not according to the men in blue.
You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why.
I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.
Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.
What do you think?
You told me you had answers.
I've been using you?!
No. I haven't.
What's wrong, Scully?
I know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.
No you didn't.
Scully...
Scully, get somebody to open this door.
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
What? What are you talking about?
I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
Why?
I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
You're... quitting?
Mulder -- what are you doing?
Mulder --
-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
You said you weren't coming?
This looks like new grass to you?
You think they went left?
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
Been where?
You hear that?
You can't quit, Scully.
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.
...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.
Scully --
We're going to the morgue.
Sit down, they're still talking to Agent Scully.
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
She's missing. We've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.
Are we being watched?
A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.
How?
The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years.  Or it may not.
Our vaccine may have no effect!
You need not kill a man to destroy him.
Did we go sailing?
He hates me.
She adores you.
We've been over this a dozen times.  No.
Don't bring it home in this.
...a pocketful of rye.
I don't need them anymore...
Absolutely.  I suppose everyone does.
Why'd you bring him here?
Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
I told you.  You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
What now?
Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.
I have done this, you know.  Been inside.
We proceed assuming she is.
But I could follow it fine. Perhaps Harry told you about me. My name's Holly Martins.
Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that.
In German?
That's Harry's place, isn't it?
Oh, the usual things...
Oh, well.
Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.
They're Harry's.
You can help us.
Vienna is a closed city, Miss Schmidt, he can't get away.
They are - private - letters.
Thank you, you have been so kind. Anna moves down to stand CL of Paine.
My name is Calloway.
I'm afraid I've never heard of you. What's your name again?
...to him.
Do you see what that means?
I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.
Win what?
Do you know his number?
You do!
Come upstairs a moment.
Never heard of him.
Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
Hear the details.
There was a third man - he didn't give evidence.
Der ami macht mich noch ganz deppert. I should have listened to my wife. She said you were up to no good. Gossip.
Now, hold on.
Yes, it is.
Joseph Harbin.
Mr. Martins...
With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
Okay.
Help you out?
I'm sorry, I don't think so.
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
Yes, of course I can swim. How far do you think it is?
Did you sleep well?
Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.
The Zionists aren't Nazis.
You coming?
Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson?
Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do.
No.
V'asitem...
About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....
You want a punch in the mouth?
Okay...  Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish.
You can't. Do you know how many people I've brought into...the movement...?
No. What are you looking for?
I didn't realize you cared.
Totally. The family emigrated from Bulgaria when he was eleven.
Leo Strauss...  I've got to go to Boston. I came to say goodbye.
They left an hour ago.  You mind some personal advice? Forget Carla. That's not the side your bread's buttered on.  How soon can you get back to the city?
I agree.
German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
What??!?
Notice? Like what...?
Jewish girls like to give head, right?
Why?
Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
He has Israel.
Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else?
To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?
It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?
What were you, following me?
Yeah, and what are you? A <i>Times</i> man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?
If I tell you, will you pull the story? Not write about me?
I always won.
How did you...?
And only talked about killing Manzetti to convince them you were an anti-Semite. If you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it.
Think about your father. Your sister.
I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....
We're already marginal. We are saying what no one else has the guts to say. Isn't that precisely our appeal?
How have things been going?
Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
What are you doing here?
You said they didn't have night guards.
The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
If I went back to the lumberyard, the guy'd give me all the dynamite I wanted. Untraceable, you wouldn't -- need to...
Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.
SO THEY SHOT HIM! SO HE WAS DEAD. SO WHAT. HE'S WORSE THAN DEAD NOW. HE'S A PIECE OF SHIT...
I'm not an intellectual.... I mean, I read, but... Fund-raising isn't what I...
Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
What's happened??
The documents are forged.
I'll send Cardoza, he'll be able to...
I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?
Good afternoon.
Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium.  Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me...  ... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about the policy and I'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now I don't have...  One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars.  But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even... and I think this is where you fire me?
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.
The Italian, I presume?
I might have known.  As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.
You forgot the Hula!
What was he like, when he was little?
He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says:  "I'm going to beat you".
Tonight we're having a little party among ourselves.  8 o'clock in my suite?
Five minutes and fifty seconds.
In my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction.
What about the shoes?
Plenty of women everywhere right?
It isn't lit yet.
Noireuter.
It's nothing.  It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
Is that alcohol?  Are you out of your mind?  Alcohol is strictly forbidden.
Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman!  How is the little Frenchman?
No.
Damn right!  That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
Why?
Hey!  Will you slow down!  When did you learn how to drive?
You still collect them?
We saw each other a little while ago.
Bonjour Monsieur... Louis. 
No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
Are you crazy?  I have no use for a woman!  Since my accident.
In my apartment?
What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?
You're back!  Hello.  We were burgled.
What is it honey... the frenchy?
Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I just want to say that I'm not happy about this. I don't want a repeat of that incident in the West Bank.
I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.
What's up?
Please. Will you help me?
My name is Esther. Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal from the Jewish Defense League desperately needs to speak with you.
What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.
So, now what?
Keep going.
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community.
...and their children will all be able to eat latkes and spin dreidels, and light the menorah with the knowl...
Anything else?
Actually, I...I don't. What does that mean?
You watch your back Hammer. Hanukkah might just be his first move. For all we know Kwanzaa could be next. There's a lot of brothers counting on you. If you fail...
What's wrong with him?
What are you doing?
Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah.
I shlepped all the way to the North Pole for this? I come to fight you, and you don't even put out anything to nosh on? What kind of arch nemesis are you?
What should I charge?
What's going on? Why'd he stop?
When you marry champagne, Clo-Clo, you can't trade it in for beer. You're stuck with it.
Maybe I should just forget all about money - - forget about mamma and the kids and the rent, huh - marry some poor dope like -- oh, like Carlos Dominguez - - and get fat and -
This is for "mama and the kids."
What about me?
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
Oh, I'm only exploring your theory. Let's take a step further. You drink, don't you, Charlie?
I don't know.
Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.
North -- in an arroyo, Shot through the head - maybe week ago. No good, skin, everything gone 
You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
Who?
Cut.
Don't look at it!
You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
Oh, dear -- I don't know what I'm going to do without you - honestly, I don't 
Hey  I'm over here.
It's about the leopard.
That's right, of course.
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
Some crazy guy.
We had given up digging in a certain barrow. I went back and I tried again. I just had a hunch.
Yes, but what sort of a man?
You know a lot. You've taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff - - what kind of a man would kill like that?
But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
So you see meeting you is a real thrill for me.
Of course. Only I'm afraid you'll be cheated. There isn't much of a view of the procession here.
That's why it just mauls and tears at them.
I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
On his back, I suppose.
I thought - is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance  this town will never forget.
No  not yet.
The whole town's in a state, Kiki doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep nobody on the streets at night 
Who is he?
Jerry, these flowers aren't really for me 
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --
I got into a little crap game.
And that is the last time any...
Can it be that easy?
Excuse me?
Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
Who is Friedman?
Just a moment...  Go ahead.
Sorry?
How did you break into my office, Deborah? Ladies of your standing dont learn to pick locks between shopping trips.  Come on, Deborah! Acting dumb doesnt suit you! Who knew Id found dirt on your brother, huh? Who knew it was in an envelope? Taking me for dead, whod want to make sure it didnt fall into the wrong hands?
Leon hung himself.
Good.
Why do I feel I neednt answer that?
You bastard...
Five years of it. Surely, youd have divorced him if he disgusted you?
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
...Were turning in circles.
To get me killed...?
Europe...  France. Im French but I live in London...  ... England.
Youre sure you wont sit down, Miss Stewart?
Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why cant you go back there?
There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?
How come youre alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
Right... Well, Ill get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
Have you found your man? Is that where he is?
Some Italian I picked up back there. Hes in the boot of the Mustang.
Im finished here and Im tired, Emily. You shouldnt be here. Now dont make it worse.
Im afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases...
I see. How much?
What?
Where are we?
I dont know...  This is just a delivery place, man! I swear I dont know where the kids are... I work for Martin, thats all. Martin knows. He works for Friedman. He knows...
How are you, Jane?
No.
Piss off!
Yes. How did...
Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
My husband and I will be leaving tomorrow for a short stay in Israel. Deborah will be here if you need anything before our return.
Vous tes Franais?
Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.
Youre out of your mind. Whats the idea?
Huh... Im sure thered be lots of takers.
Yeah.
Have you?
Will you be alone?  The merchandise. Is it just you or...
As you know from speaking to Phil, your friend Leon has disappeared, Rhian. His family have hired me to find him.
Whats the date?
Ive been away.  Did Leon speak to you about his sister?
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
I... How long have I been here?
Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
Bye. And thanks... Nathalie gently closes the door, eyes Lombard who shakes himself awake... rolls her eyes and surveys the room...
Five seconds. Then you die.
Why did you kill him?
I think youd rather not know what I think.
Some guy called to let him know the Frenchman whod called the night before he left London was in L.A. looking to kill him. He did his sums and decided to take the call seriously.
Moreau? Cest moi. Alors...
Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, Id watch my step. These people are well-connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The ladys also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.
My dear Aulon...  That's fine...
Listen, please accept my apologies for... you know, me pretending to be the... well it wasn't really my idea... well, yes it was my idea but...
I thought you were an archer?
Who do they think I am?!
Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
Yes...
What did the king say?
I would like to marry you.  But I have already promised myself... to God.
I'm already free...
I -- I don't understand...
... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even...  ... wouldn't that be a fine thing? You, a lady of title!
Is it true that you launched an attack on Paris?
I don't know...
Ah, yes, I forgot... God sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission!  Do you think that God made the right decision, to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of France?
Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
Tell us, Jeanne... do you often hear this voice?
Sign this, and I will confess you myself if you want.
Your health and happiness has always been my first concern, Charles... ever since you were a little boy -- and I think I know you better than your own mother...
I can see her if I want to.  I mean, with half of France in the hands of the English, what have I got to lose?
If there was, I didn't see it...
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
Is it long and hanging down?
For what?
Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
And it's not the first one!  They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...
God... why of course -- we'd forgotten about him!  Strange, I don't seem to remember seeing him at Agincourt.
So... bring up the reinforcements!
Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers.
He never sent them... Don't you understand?  He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...
And you didn't jump of your free will?
Why not?  He has good teeth...
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!
I swear I'll never swear again in my life if you save her life!  But I'm warning you, if you let her die, then you're the biggest...
Jeanne... the man hasn't been paid for six months -- that's his only reward.  Let him take a few teeth...
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
Oh?  And just because you realize now, everybody else should forgive you?!
I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
I don't understand.  What do you want from me?
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
My father's.
He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.
I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.
Will I still be able to play?
Get your things together, you have to leave!
Henryk's in there.
Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!
But why me? I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean...
And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about. Let's enjoy our meal.
You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
I thought you'd be off on tour, playing London, Paris, New York?
I've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father. I've managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but I need one more for my father. I've been trying all the firms, the shops...
Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
Pig!
Bitch!
If I play like an angel, why don't you listen?
Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.
I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought the certificates would save us all.
I was... I was trying to open this tin.
What's all that gunfire?
Watch your feet!
Well you stopped combing your hair, which is a good thing, it was looking over done.  You see these are the slits that the heads will go through, show him Nessie ... they'll be dead, the Reverend is going to use animal blood, no doubt it will be very dramatic. Tea! 
My REAL father was a famous German composer
Which mountains are those dear?
Ohhh I've never been there. 
Well, that is a strong opinion.
I got the good wife for you Peini. She pray good. Clean. Read Bible. You sleep her Peini. She chief daughter.
Go Peini ... Haere atu e Peini.
I worry for you.
She looks tired.
I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
She has spoken to me. I heard her voice. There was no sound, but I beard it here . Her voice was there in my head. I watched her lips, they did not make the words, yet the harder I listened the clearer I heard her, as clear as I hear you, as dear as I hear my own voice.
He chopped it off
She says, throw it overboard. She doesn't want it. She says it's spoiled
Hello, then.
You've missed this bit.
That's right.
Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.
You just sit tight, old man.  We're gonna have to get you to a doctor.  I'll call a cop.
You're crazy carryin' that kinda money in this neighborhood.  No wonder you got hit.
I gotta!  Look, I run some slots down in West Bend for a mob here. I got a little behind on my payoffs so they figure I been holdin' out on 'em.  They gave me to 4:00 to come up with the cash.  I don't get it there I'm dead.
It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now.
There's always a depression on.
Which one?
I don't know.  Could be.  We're runnin' that down now.
Hackers.
What do ya want the others to get?
I picked something up on the way.
I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.
You can't do it alone, ya know.  It takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make 'em look good.
Then you'll do it?
You just worry about your end, kid.
You wanta wait for your share?
All you gotta do is show up with some money and look like a fool.
He's gonna hit ya with 20 grand, Eddie.  How much cash we got?
Looks like he's sulking.
What's the problem?
I guess I left it in my room.
Never get enough, huh pal?  I'd think you'd get tired of losin', Honnigan.
How do I know you're tellin' the truth.
I'll tell ya what you did, smart boy.  You tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from Maxies.  You and Coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th.  If he hadn't been a numbers runner for Doyle Lonnegan, it woulda been perfect.
I'll square it with the fixer.
2:00 A.M.
What does this guy want?
I don't even know you.
You really picked a winner, kid.
I could come up with 750 grand in a day if I had a reason to.
I don't know.  He took it hard.
What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
Have the police got any idea where Wynant is?
Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper.
You know how they are... sex...
Is that what it means?
That is, if it's all right with you.
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
This is a pretty dead bunch, isn't it?
How are you?....  Oh, I'm Mrs. Jorgensen now....  No, she isn't here.  Is it about her father?  Well, can I take the message?
What is it?
You took that money from Julia's hand.
All right, then.  I'll tell them.
He wouldn't say.
Andy...  this is Nick Charles.  He worked on a case for father.
I don't know anything -- I've been in California for four years. What about his lawyer? Used to be a guy named Mac-- something.
It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
It's a promise?
Better get home before it is.
Not at all.
I'll have to try to remember.
What do you mean?
I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.
I guess that cinches it, eh, Mr. Charles?  He killed them both - Julia Wolf and Nunheim.
"D.W.R."  That case you worked on... the guy who threatened to kill Wynant... what what was his name?
When was the last time you gave her money for Wynant?
I wasn't in.  My secretary took the message.  He left word for me to meet him at the Plaza.
Want to take a poke at him?
All right.  All right.
I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
That's my business.
Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very "Merry Christmas" for you.
I got word from Wynant this morning...
Never mind.
My wife's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things.  And I'm looking after them.
It might.
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
You did... where?
Perfectly absurd.
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted - 
Come on -- relax --  Give them a drink.
Nick!  Nick!  Are you asleep?
Don't you think you'd like to go back to detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?
I'd like to see you work.
Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.
What are you going to give me?  I hope I don't like it.
Want a drink?
Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant!  "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".
Let's see.  Where's it from?
Your guess is as good as mine.
Sit down!
But Wynant --- ?
I don't believe he did it.
Why don't you?
Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
It was his body that was buried there.
But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
Huh?
What things made you so sure?
Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
Is that true?
Why are you saying it?
I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.
You his wife?
Bonds, sir?
I'm fired.
You speak English?  DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?
This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
Well, based on my knowledge of the region, its culture and her people I would have to say it's a box.
Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be home in no time.
I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.
What are you doing.
He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
What do you figure it to be?
That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
In the flack jacket.  Still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat. Took the air right out of me, but I was just unconscious for awhile.  'Course, you didn't stick around to find that out. You left me for dead.
What!?  What!?
She okay?
What?
Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast.
What!?
You didn't step on any mine.
Oh, God!  Oh God!
Why you got to move away to talk!?
I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.
How's this going to work?
I don't hear any--
Don't!
But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.
Where is it?  Where'd it go?
Where the hell is it!?
I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
It's just a mongoose.
He's not going to leave us.
First Wes, now you?
Sure.
What do you figure it is?
Well, we should identify ourselves.
I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.
What do we do?
Shi'ites, I think.
I don't know!
...Wes...?
Damn it.  We lost the horses.
We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm horny."  I can use that now.
Now you need me.
What's your point, Wes?  You have a point?
Jaeger?
We...we could go home with something else.
Epps, is that a sand dune.
Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you figure it is?
Yeah!  Gold!  How much?
Iraqis.
How long we going to keep this up.
Is there anything you do know?
We're American soldiers.  We don't abandon people.
What do you think?
What's this?  Why did you change it?
I've never been under the table before.
Look,dirt!
I couldn't turn you in, not now. I....I know I wouldn't!
Are you all right?
We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch.  She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You're upsetting yourself.  Would you like something?
What?
Which way?
What was that....
No......  She's dead THX........
Yes
Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.
Treat. We treat devices.
Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?
Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
You guys seem pretty tight.
Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.
It's working.
Driving in circles, waiting for-
How do you know?
Should we head for the Interstate?
Off the scale.
Wires... metal, cold... something soft...
"Punks", huh?
No, we're terrorists, stay back or we'll blow.
Glass, what is it?
Relax, Pooch, it's just a ticker, it's not personal.
Why are we stopping here?
No... No more killing.
Who are you calling, sis?
I want to work this.
What about the ballistics report?
Mike. No thanks, I'm fine.
Fuckin A, I think I got two partial prints here!
We're vice, I didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. But if you're so gung-ho, we'd best call it in for some back-up.
Vice cop on a homicide?
T.J., what're you doing?
Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
What?
I'll do it.
Goddamit, Reilly--
So you lost a handbag, madame?
No!
<u>Tonsili!</u>
No.
Nice day, Major.
Like it?
Smart. London, eh?
I would start with cocktails.
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.
No, Baron!  I beg your pardon.
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
Very well, m'sieu.
Who?
Please.  When I came here it was for a little adventure--a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. But something has changed me--and it isn't the champagne.  The whole thing is new to me. Very new. I've got a confession to make to you.  Baron, you are a crook.  You robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine.  May I have the salt?
No, thank you.
Thank you, Baron.
And take the twenty thousand francs ...
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
Oh, no, darling. There's <u>more</u> sex appeal coming on the first of the month.  It's only ten days ...  Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
Filiba ...
He recognized you!
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
You <u>have</u> to get out of here!
Thirty-five to the left--sixty- three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... Seventy-six, eighty-four, fifty-five--  What has she got that I haven't got?
And you--
Oh ... That's strange. Maybe--are you sure this is your bag?
Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?
But one suggestion, madame.  Not the major.  I don't  mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  And one lipstick ...  Scarlet number four.
That's what you need!
Yes!
It <u>is</u> beautiful. But I got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so I gave it to my secretary.
Oh? 
This used to be my secretary's room.
You think that's too much?
Madame Colet, I think you deserve a scolding. First, you lose your bag--
Crimson!
Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?
You would?
I know all your tricks.
Any minute I want!
Call the police?
You have been robbed--for years. And not a hundred thousand francs, but millions. And you know who did it? Adolph.
It would be a terrible scandal, wouldn't it?
Giron...!
It could have been marvelous ...
Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrant--then you'll be glad you're alone.
But it could have been glorious.
You've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.
About what?
No--I'm sorry.
Who's the best? Say it.
Rose Calvert.
She's not on the starboard side either.
Your daughter is much too hard to impress, Ruth.  Mind your step.
You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...?  Picasso.
But I was with him the whole time.
There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us.
They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.
What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me.
How cold?
HELP! HELP!!
Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
Is he your boyfriend?
Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?
I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
You're right. Only you can do that.
Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.
When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.
That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.
Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.
Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
I'll join you later.
Don't look so uncomfortable, Lee--it interferes with your good looks. Give me a cigarette.  What did you do--persuade her to come on this voyage with you?
Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
Baloney!
We'll save you a place at our table.
No--I'm furious!--Nobody seems to do anything about it--
I don't understand.
In that case--you owe us exactly sixteen hundred dollars.
I'm so sorry!
Nice lines--
Brett is the name.
Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.
Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?
When?
Thanks.
What, again?
Who with?
You can't lose me, Sally--I'm no lily myself!
Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?
A dollar forty.
You take some awful chances.
Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
Say--wait a minute!
Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
I'm going to the show--
Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
Eighty cents a word--three--six--nine words. That'll be seven twenty, but it's too much--I'll show you how to save some money.
Next month is June.
O.K.! Send that!
Knots!
Yes--Me--in person!
Hey, boy--give this man a cablegram blank.  Where is your wife?
Those kids seem to be getting along fine!--
It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
Hello, Inspector--I hear your vacation's been spoiled. Somebody lost a bracelet.
You're the President. Come in! Your brother was just telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio--
And you've put it over--haven't you?
Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee wouldn't stand for it and--well--here I am!
Very serious?
Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?
Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--
Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
Why don't you leave me alone?
I wish I could.
Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
No!
I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
Ain't got time.
Then why did you run away?
Skinny lunger, your guns don't Impress me.  Wasn't for those guns You'd be nothin'.
That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a Name for himself as a peace Officer in Kansas.
Listen, I want to talk to you.
Easy.  I just wanted to tell you Things're about to start changing Around here.  Lots of so-called Hard cases and tough-nuts swagger Around this town but none of 'em's got a clue about the real play.  None of 'em.
What'd the Messican mean, a sick Horse's gonna get us?  Didn't make No sense.
Come on, you...
Feel bad about ol' Fred.  Just Can't hold back when I'm feelin' Woolly.  Still, feel kinda bad. But now we're square.  Anyway no Use for holdin' a grudge.  I Deserved a rap in the head.
Fair enough.  You know I got to Admit, you got a lot of bark on You comin' up here like this.
They were all gonna jump me back There.  What ever happened to one Against one?
I want you to know it's over. We're leaving and we're not Coming back.
Excuse me?
But wait, you don't understand-
I see, off to strike it rich, Huh.  All right, fine, wish you Luck.  Tell you this though, never Was a rich man yet didn't wind up With a guilty conscience.
How you feeling, Doc?
Since when is faro a business?
So now we're in the mining Business.  Turning into regular Tycoons.  Gonna call this one the Mattie Blaylock.  Mattie'll get a Kick out of that, it's her maiden Name.
You know damn well who I mean. That dusky-hued lady Satan.
Satisfied?
Nonsense, I have not yet begun to Defile myself.
That's all right, Doc.  Don't worry.
How you feelin', Doc?
All right.  Then what?
Hey, is that "Old Dog Tray"? Sounds like "Old Dog Tray".
Told you.  I'm red hot, I'm Blazin'!  Now, red seven.  Seven Stinkin' diamonds.  Look out!  Five Thousand!  Let's go!
You tell Ringo... just tell him I'll be there.
Wyatt, listen, you can't beat Him.  You're good and God knows You got the courage, but you Ain't in Ringo's class.  Hell, He's the best that's ever been. 'Cept maybe for Wild Bill.
Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That Means lucky.
Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed.
I laugh sometimes
I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all.  Am I Happy?  Are you happy?
What's wrong?
Look, it's too much of a tangle. I already cast my lot.  I can't go Back and I can't sneak, feel back Enough as it is.
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy.
I have to go.
Wyatt!  My God...
I have nothing left.  I have Nothing to give you.  I have no Pride, no dignity, no money.  I Don't even know how we'll make a Living.  But I promise I'll love You every second of your life.
No, stay.  Please stay with me.
No, no, I don't want to keep you.
'Least they don't scare women.
There they are.  No herd though.
Give him some good exercise?  Sure Some stud.  Some string in fact. What're you gonna do, race 'em?
Well what do you think happens When you die?
Listen to me, both of you.  This Is no good.  This is trouble we Don't need.  For the first time in Our lives we got a chance to stop Wandering and finally be a Family.  Do this and you throw it All away.  You saw what happened To Fred White.
Well that's your problem.  Hey Virge, see anything of Doc while You were in Prescott?
Business is business.  Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not If there's money in it.
Wait till the liquor wears off. Once they start getting headaches They'll lose interest.
Wyatt, I know what I'm doin'.
Why don't you just leave it alone?
Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.
Still, I do miss her. I only wish she could have lived to see all this.
They're merely tools to disseminate information.
Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor...  And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -
Where can I find him?
I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -
Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road.  All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns -  Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse -  Stop that!  Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.
... 17 Beverage cup holders?
More scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip.
Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
I see...
Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.
That's reassuring.
I don't know if you'd call it a boat...
Yo! Jimbo! I won five hundred -  What happened?
They'd never sail this close to the shore.
I got you covered.
Where to now, Jimbo?
... Kids?
Here. I gave you my assistant's phone number. If it's urgent, she knows where to reach me.
Thanks.  Take care -
This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor.  James Bond.
- Shut up!
... How did you get into marine salvage?
Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.
If not?
Before we go any further here, Mr. Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just want to get two things straight.
And when might that be?
The reason I invited the Minister here, 007, was to reassure him that this investigation will be handled with the utmost discretion.
You're to wear this mask at the Venice Carnival, and wait to be contacted.
I have an excellent teacher.  'Make sure you wear the uniform'?
Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?
And the 9:30 news meeting is waiting.
A dead head.  Water logged timber. Floats straight up. You sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on Sumatra - but they don't usually float this far west.  Muncy! Engines to half!
He brought that up from the wreck.
...Well! I do believe this requires further investigation!
Take the men. I can finish alone.
Fueled and waiting.
What about ID's?
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
Soviet SB-9 nuclear torpedo. Yield, one kiloton.
Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.
We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.
I'm going back home with Harry.
Don't make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction.
Never play with someone's else's cards. You always get a new deck. Look at this card. See anything?
I don't want to wear out welcome, but you can stay in someone's heart longer than you can stay in their house. Come with us, boy. We are going to have a good time.
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it.  Son, you make me wish I was dead.
It's good to be able to hear that.
How is the garden doing?
Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.
How often is your wife called to help delivery?
Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. City people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. You don't plant old ways...  ... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you.  It's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don't want it. You sell it to a stranger. You worked your whole life, for what?  I doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. All what we've experienced has no meaning.
You remember that boy who lost his mind, Joe? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. He would pick up a brick and say "go on in there brick and hit somebody" and it would find its mark.
He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
I think if anybody had a hand in killing Hocker, you ought to ask or you should have asked Emory and Chick.
Why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone? I remember when you weren't saved. That was way back yonder when the Natchez Trace was just a dirt road.
You know the saying, "your heart is in your left hand."
In the meantime Harry can slaughter us a hog.
He should be caring. That is not too much to ask.
All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.
No, but I might have some Indian Chief Tonic.
I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
He is in his pigeon cage.
I didn't mean for you to pay me for that.
But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
Can I bring some toys?
But Mom, I can't find him!
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
Woody!  Buzz!
Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who?
We're almost there.
Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
It's not working.  I recharged it before I left.  It should be good for hours --
Don't tell me what to do!
I think you've had enough tea for today.  Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.
But why would Andy want me?
Woody!  It's the moving van.
Great!
Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!!
MOM!!  MOM!!
Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was guilty.
Aa-a-a-a-ah! 
Will you quit moving around?!
Wait just a minute.  What are you trying to pull?!
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
It's Sid!
Mission accomplished.  Well done, men.  Pack it up, we're going home.
There.
This is ludicrous.
There's no mirror.
I like plaits.
You're not so old yourself!
I finished it off.
I've got a present for you...
Reprieve.
Somebody couldn't wait until dark.
I thought she was fondest of you, because you were the youngest.
How long has -
I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.
Juliet who?
Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you.  Consider it gone away.  She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.
Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
I can't find Manolo.
I understand.  You're upset.  You want to know what's going on.  That's good.
You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl.  We get Adler and we beat this thing.
Arnie, help me.  Doesn't anyone owe us money?
Don't bother.
That's frustrating.
Honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments.  I tried --
Space for what?  To O.D. like that other kid?  I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  Because it isn't.  Correct?
My Leica's gone.
Czar for life, just like a real czar.
Helena --
As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some "face time".
Will we get invited to the White House?
...How old are you?
Sixteen
Yes.
I get A's.  All A's.
Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
Chill out --
They're whispering.  I can't hear them, but I know it.  I smell conspiracy.  I feel the lie vibrating out of the home.
You may speak.
The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway. I wish you could see how transparent you are.  This food tastes like shit.
Yes, he threatened to kill my five year-old son.  I was under the impression I would be meeting Juan Obregon.
No, this is not possible.  And I thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it's been a pointless journey.
Your new friends.
What?
It could mean that, yes.
We ask questions and measure the answers.  When something doesn't ring true, a fact that doesn't make sense, a slight hesitation, then it's off to secondary for a closer look.  Before NAFTA we had about 1.9 million trucks a year.  Now it's almost double.  Pretty soon there'll be Mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as American truck companies.
Any way we can do it better?
I'm not the police.  I don't care about experimentation.  She's a kid. I'm worried to death.
Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year.  But, you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force.  We get a tip that he is one place, then we get there and he is already gone, having been warned by someone on our side.
Yes, I hope so as well.
Did you tell him?
Well, why didn't you bring them?
What?
Excuse me, I don't mean to harass you, but I was very impressed by the capable and stylish manner in which you dealt with that situation. I thought to myself: she's special.
What?
Eh-
No, not holding hands.
No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.
One of Edinburgh's finest schools.
Thank you, Mr. Murphy. We'll let you know.
There's no need.
I'd really rather take care of it myself.
No.
That's nice.
No, I'm clean.
Now remember --
And you might get the fucking job.
OK, so who was it, then?
So who else?
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
Oh no, don't even mention it.
He made me lick it.
You're all hear.
I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it here.'  Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?
Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
There's a mate of swanney's. Mikey Forrester -- you know the guy. He's come into some gear. A lot of gear.
But you don't have the money?
And see when I get out of here. I've got plans. Going to get myself straightened out and head off to Thailand, where women really know how to treat a guy. See, out there you can live like a king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket. No fucking problem.
Sure.
This had better be good.
Such as?
How long is it?
Six weeks!
We go for a walk.
Homeless people?
Sulu! Look! The sun's come out! It's a miracle!
With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
Oh, please.
Your pain runs deep.
I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
Captain, we can't trust anyone now.
And that is?
Oh. I believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the singalong.
The same. He's apparently fallen out of favor with the Klingon High Command.
Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?
At footspeed I estimate the journey to Paradise City at 1.2 hours.
Yes, Captain?
Exactly 15.5 seconds.
Captain, what have I done -
You mean he's your brother brother?  You made that up!
Exactly. That is correct. Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess. Upon her death, Sybok and I were raised as brothers.
I am here, Captain.
I believe I have found a faster way.
Who are you?
No... I didn't.
Your vision?
Given to me by God.  He waits for us on the other side.


Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
Sybok, you must surrender.
This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...
Sybok, we must find a way...
Dillinger?
Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in there...
Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?
Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not interested in talking about him.
Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
This town's full o' live ones.
You said it.
Flynn?
Meanwhile, he might find it.
Cute.
I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
You wouldn't dare.
Walter, I sympathize, but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy --
The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that --
Well I want to communicate --
What, just the three of us?
Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on.
Did we make it?
Boy the view from up here... you know the territory?
You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that.
He was disoriented in transport, Tron.
The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?
We have to talk.
Okay ... Flynn, I'm gonna put you at my terminal, down in the laser lab. We'll be up in Alan's office.
Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know, a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User even wrote you...
Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...
New guy...
Yori... hey...
Nice...
It's something Users do.
That's not true, honey--
You seem fine now.
There are going to be some changes Dana.  You're going to start following some rules.  And I'm going to be there to see that you do.
Dad, how come you know the words?
Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
Alright, I want a complete workup on her.  Do we know where she is?
Immediate roll.  Acquire subject at K Street and Key Bridge.					* Vehicle is red-and-white						* convertible.  You have six minutes.
Yes.
Harry?  HARRY?!
What's this for?
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
Station wagon?
Look at the way the little punk is driving.  He's all over the place.  Look-- he hasn't signalled once.
Oh shit.  Harry... what're you doing?
They said you had to run out.
That's none of your goddamn business!  What kind of questions are these?
So last night was pretty exciting, huh?
Harry, what's the matter with you?  Tell them the truth.  We're married, we have a daughter--
Well, think of it as playing a role.  It's fantasy.  You have to work on their dreams.  Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours.
What about the husbands?
What?
Like one?
Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?
Worse than Cairo?							*
And you chased one?
What is it you need me to do?
You see what I mean?  That reaction would give us away in a second.  Try to relax.
You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.
What letter?
Gotten your mail yet?
Let me speak to Clarence.
The letter I sent.
Tell him to look through it.
... when my mom went into labor, my dad panicked. He never had a kid before, and crashed the car. Now, picture this: their car's demolished, crowd is starting to gather, my mom is yelling, going into contractions, and my dad, who was losing it before, is now completely screaming yellow zonkers. Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus appears, and the bus-driver says, "Get her in here.". He forgot all about his route and just drove straight to the hospital. So, because he was such a nice guy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. Well, his name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if I'da been a boy, they would't call me Waldo. So they asked Waldo where he was from. And, so there you go.
Not at all. I, this guy here, he's Sonny Chiba.
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
Where's your car? I'll walk you to it.
Ask me them again. One by one.
Very much. Now, where were we?
Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel".
Turn-offs?
That's a long time.
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.
Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.
Uh-huh.
Is he nice?
You better not be fucking teasing me.
I don't believe so.
Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.
Look, sweetheart, he scares you. But I'm not scared of that motherfucker. He can't touch you now. You're completely out of his reach. He poses absolutely no threat to us. So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it would be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it?
You wanna get unhaunted?
Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.
You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as kissin' his ass.
I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
You comin' to L.A.? When?
What?
What's to think about?
Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit.
You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're unloading -
He wants to talk ya.
Well, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to "Doctor Zhivago" are in arbitration?
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.
You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.  Where's a good chicken place around here?
Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?
What makes you think I would do that?
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?
Uh-huh.
You and Robin moved?
Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood.  And what you're trying to do is get him off.  Whenever you're ready.
You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -
And just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get married, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because you'll know what it's like to be a woman.
We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine.
What was I sayin'?
Looky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with Cherry Seven-Up.
Well fuck you guys then! You guys are fucked up!
They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.
No way, Jos.
Yeah, I live here.
Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti.  Do you know Nick Cardella?
No.
To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
Mr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly. I'm a psychiatrist.  I work for the County -- I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being -- do you understand that?
I need to go now.
Change what?
You think it's July of 1995?  That's the future, James.  Do you think you're living in the future?
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?
You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you.
"Never cry wolf!"
Give me the gun.
It was?  I didn't...know.
I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid.  Where a boy...
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
They may be looking for us, James.  Use this.  You can fix it in the Men's Room.
I need to make a telephone call.
What's that mean?
It's private.
Jo...Jose????
How did you find me?
The phone call, man.  The phone call.
Hey, man...
Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't an inquisition.
Two policemen were already in the hospital and now we have an orderly with a broken arm and a Security Officer with a fractured skull.
You "develop" viruses and you're calling me insane?  Typical.  What does this virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.  Have I ever "developed" a virus?  Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy!
WHY DON'T WE FORGET MY GODDAMN PSYCHIATRIST AND DEAL WITH THE TASK AT HAND.  THIS IS IMPORTANT.
He's been tested for drugs?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
Maybe I do.
I think I've heard that before.
I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.
Out of here.
How much.
One way.
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
You Harlin?
Will he be back soon?
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
That'll make five in a row.  Never seen it so hot.  Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed.  I'd rather just lay there and try to catch a breeze.  I was in Mexico this one time--
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
Truck stop up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
That's about an hour and a half longer than I usually spend looking for parts.  You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
Two-hundred.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  I can't do unauthorized work. I suppose I can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
Please, just leave the car alone.
We ain't got no Beck's.
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, hon.  Enjoy your beer, and try to have a nice day.
There you go, Mrs. McKenna.  Just put it in there.
They look nice.
What the hell you looking at, girl?
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
Wasn't nothing.
I just got tired of looking at the old drapes.  Had them long as I can remember.
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
Good luck it didn't happen a few miles back.  Maybe they never would have found you.  Day like today you'd be dead for sure.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some work there.
I pack up and go somewhere else.
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
Did you like it; me watching you?
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.
Did you ever?
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.  I mean, I would . . . do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:  You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
I can't.
Jake.
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
Lied?  What do you mean?
What are you talking about?
I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
You got a suitcase?
You heard me.  Count it out.
I know.  He was to take the fucking money.
Well, nothing.
Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.
What difference does it make?  You killed Jake.
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
I'm here.
John, throw me the keys.
What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so.
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
I . . I was helping your wife.  I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
You've got to be--
Like you don't know.
I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
I did?
You meant it.
For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday.
The sooner it's over, the sooner you're on your way.  Now listen to me:  It's got to look like an accident; that's the thing.  If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before.  I guess I should have hired a professional.
This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
You love her, but you hate her?
Shut up.
And next time, next time somebody is going to get dead.
Jake, how much were you going to pay me to do the job?
Maybe not this time, but somebody's going to get dead around you.
Don't Jake me, boy!  It's a big house.  Odd that you would know your way, except maybe you've been in the bedroom before.  Maybe with Grace to keep you company.
Christ, Jake, please--
I want to stay.
What?
Accident, and yeah, I got to be more careful.
She's dead.
Hey, Mister.  Mister.  I just. . . I just wanted to thank you.
For what?
You expect me to believe that?
Mister!
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then . . . and then bust those pieces up, and then . . . and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
Now, what's this?
He is at that.  No so much a fault of his own.  Poor boy had quite a trauma as a child.
Wish I could help, Sheriff.  But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car.  Then I'm getting the hell out of this place.
Not taking a drive, Sheriff. Heading out of town.
Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra.  What with that ruckus you had with Toby.  Oh yes, I heard all about that.
Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam.  Lost them fighting the commies.  Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
Well, people gotta get by somehow. That's the curse. The mines done it. All that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that "om"! Everybody's got a mother. You don't rip up your mother. You don't rip up the Earth and take everything out. It's like the Cracker Jack box says, "the more you eat, the more you want...."...
...But ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?
You <u>are</u> crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man.
Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
Let's see...they're not very imaginative?
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.
Stand up.
You idiot!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit.  A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh? Women.
Would I what?
About things.  About your wife.
Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
Oh yeah sure. Why don't I buy you a plane ticket right out of here while I'm at it. I <u>know you</u>...  This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her. How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's a cool car.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
You own this place?
Darrell--
What the hell happened to my car?
"That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."
...got no day, got no date.  Probably ain't worth a duck's fart . This one here cost me $3.75 and it's got every doodad you can imagine. No sir I'll stick with this .
You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says...
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
What?
You sure you can manage?
What happened to your hand?
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
So, what is it you do, Mister...?
Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.
What do you mean?
In <u>cash</u>?
Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...
I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody.
Stop it.
I thought you couldn't get your car.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
The money's right here! Get the key!
Bobby?  What the hell's the matter with you?
But I thought --
He was a <u>cop</u>, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...
Why?
Well, nothing. We dump Jake, we split the money, then you're on your own.
Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.
Where ya goin'?
Seen you popping up a little bit of everywhere today.  You're not planning on staying are you?
That's a shame, Bobby.  A real shame.
No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they <u>both</u> get nailed... get shot by the old lady.
The old lady?
Mr. Arkady, honest, I ad to beat it outta there before the cops showed. So now I don't have a cent to my name. I can't even get my car out of the garage.  I tell you, Mister...  if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have nay fuckin' luck at all, you know?   So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car out of this garage, see?  The bus depot here has a Western Union thing.  And of course I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
Beck's.
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
Morning Grace.
They look nice.
Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.
You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.
Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.
I want to stay.
Is Noel in?
I'm listening.
I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.
The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.
What do I do when I'm around someone I know?
He's just laying in bed. He's pretty upset. He won't talk.
My turn. What's your favorite song?
Soft and Wet. That's very interesting.
Seventy-five percent.
Seventy-five percent? That's not nearly good enough for me. I'm extremely skeptical.
Skeptical about what?
At the church... You were following me weren't you?
He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
I'm very proud of him.  He's been through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. A couple I'd thought had broken him... I mean emotionally.  They were bad... But he made it. Yes he did.
Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
I want to sleep here tonight.
I won't make any noise.
You think you could beat up Mike Tyson? I mean before he started wiggin out and eating people's ears?
No.
How many did you put on that time?
All of it.
I'm not scared.
Don't be scared.
You like sports?
We're going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this.  It works the quadriceps.
I didn't think they'd really do it.
What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
Nope.
Three days. Are you hungry?
Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
You want... a free one.
Yeah. See?
She back in Kansas?
Hullo, Bob. Boys, this here is English Bob.
I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska.  Who's your friend?
Charley, see what kind of "books" Mister Beauchamp is packing... but watch you don't get wet.
What's all that wood?
Yup.
I didn't hear nothin' till last night.
That much, huh?
What's your name?
You work for the railroads too, Mister Beauchamp?
It's only a b-b-b-book...
Meaning the duck himself, I guess.
Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
He's... he's dead.
They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
Who killed him?
Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
He said how you was really Three Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an' Bill said "Same Three Fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?" An' Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73.
On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
She's passed on, Kid.
Huh?
Did you kill him?
He ain't killed.
Tell me right off if you see him.
Is it him?
You... gonna take... the money?
You're gonna kill him, ain't you?
He musta been movin' right along.
Nor Quincy, I guess.
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
You ain't like that no more.
Yeah.
HEY, KID.
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
I seen him.
Worms was comin' out.
I guess you didn't kill nobody then.
Well, suppose he does?
You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?
Yeah?
We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
They just said they wanted time.
They ruined me tonight.
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.
Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
Everybody I ever worked with, did time with.
County. I was in for fraud.
You have to come.
I was out of line.
You okay?
I'11 be alright.
Fenster and Hockney?
What-are they speaking?
with what?
You know damn well, dead-man.
Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
And I am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions.
You know a religious guy named John Paul?
Heartwarming. Really, I feel weepy.
He loved her.
You think I don't know you held out on the D.A.? What did you leave out of that testimony? I can be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes.
What call?
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department. He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.
There were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser Soze so Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he knew he could march into certain death.
He wanted me to live.
No...
Keaton was Keyser Soze
This is all bullshit.
Why lie about everything else, then?
May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
Counselor, I will prosecute your client.
Abrams...
Yes.
How good's your intelligence?
This is a nuisance suit.  He's looking for small change.  He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
No.  Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
Yes.
No, actually, she was referred to me.  She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
Tell me one?
Engaged to render an opinion.  For a price.  Is that correct?  You're being paid to be here today?
Just as you are, Sir...
I'm on the staff of...
Yes.    It is a crime.  A serious crime.
Yes.
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?
I...
What you thought!?  What you thought...I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
I'm going to win this case...Mist...Mr. Doneghy...I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
...apartment.   No, no. Please.  You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
No, you did fine.
Dr. Gruber ...
I read the hospital report on your client.
Well, well, when can we meet again. I'd like to get a deposition..
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
I've got nothing to say to you.
I do.  Who is it?  The Doctors. What do you owe them?
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
Then why don't you testify?
You know, you're pushy, fella...
...things change.
I had a witness disappear on me.
How come you're calling me from...?
We find that your subscription lapsed...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
Missus...
Still looking.
The TV didn't work.
You, you don't under...
Oh, yes, I do, Joe.  Believe me. You say you're going to lose.  Is it my fault?  Listen!  The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
No.
...he's a good man...?  He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness...he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis...don't fuck with this case.
We've got her sister.  Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
I'm getting it back.  Don't worry about me, Mick.  I'm fine.  D'you find the obstetric nurse?
So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
I can't talk now.
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
That's right.
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
The broad has disappeared...
...yeah...good...
... we, we love her, Dick and me ...
... fifty thousand dollars?
... I understand ...
He saw her at the Northern Care...
Who told you that?
Yes.
What did she say?
Dr. Towler...
Yes.
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
What happened in those three minutes...?
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
He won't talk.
I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
No.
No.
But you knew about this.
Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
What about?
I've heard that one before, too. I remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with, but she ditched you for another guy, and you've been carrying the torch ever since, and then you saw me and something clicked.  Huh!
You won't have to.
What do you want to know?
About three years.
Yes.
Why?  Because I remind you of someone?  That's not very complimentary.  And nothing would... happen...
Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.
But Scottie, you don't have to!
Scottie, what are you doing?
Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.
I wish you'd leave me alone. I want to go away.
Mmmm.
How does it work?
No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here.
And she was the one who died. Not you.  The real wife.  You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?
Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
No...
You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?
And no birds sing.
What else?
Where?
No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
But I'm the woman in the mirror!
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
What is her name?
Her car is gone.
I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
I know. Everybody tells me.
He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.
Here, I'll show you what I mean. We'll start with this.
Yeah.
Who's the guy, who's the wife?
Out!
If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
Can't do what?
Don't point at me.
I have plenty of friends.
Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
One idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars.
Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing?
Are you sure this was an accident?
That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
Just giving the facts.
You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.
We can't do this.
How do you figure?
That is absolutely not true.
What is your problem?
Where is she?
Who?
You said that Boyd.
Oh God. This is insane.
That is a load of shit. Personal power has nothing to do with any of this. Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this...Well that's just more than the man deserves.
He is not cracking up.
What?
What is the question you asked me?
Regarding what?
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most.
Whatever you say Kojak.
The hell you didn't!
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.
And what happens when you can't?
Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic. The former Pittsburgh Steeler running back, beat known for "The Immaculate Reception," his improbable sixty yard Ricochet Reception. I say Ricochet Reception has made a bold move on corporate America.  Harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the Park Sausage Company. By taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park's, Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime.
How about my Fatburger?
These rings represent the commitment Fisher and Liz make to each other on the day. Fisher do you take Liz to be your beloved wife, to respect, honor and cherish till death do you part?
Can't we do it on the phone?
Sent it.
I'm not playing around. I forgot.
They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.
What are you talking about?
I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here.
He's weird. And I expect more from you.
Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.
Hello.
What about the chairs?
Can we just talk this out?
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
Do you love me?
What kind of stupid question is that?
The prostitute.
Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned.
But...
So what do we do?
I...Liz...all I ever wanted, was for you to be happy. I just wanted to give you the wedding, the life you always dreamed of...  ...I just love you so much...So much...
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.
Greenpeace?
Where's Boyd?
Pup corn?
We don't say "love, honor and obey" anymore. And we don't say "till death do us part." Today we say, "respect, honor and cherish, as long as you both do love." How does that sound?
Oh I know that. How does it go...
The post-Vegas Man.
Good times.
Fucking desert.
You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect.
I'll come to you tonight.
Enedina and Paco ...
How long are you staying?
And this innocent child.
I should like you to do something for me. It's an innocent sort of thing but I'm very set on it.
Unfortunately ...
Leave us alone, Ramona.
Let me pass!
All that I said just now was a lie. I said it so you wouldn't leave. I only molested you in my thoughts ... I can't bear to have you leave me, hating me like this.  Tell me you believe what I'm saying and I'll let you go.
The way she looked at me, Ramona! She hates me now. I think I've made a great mistake. She's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her.
That's it.
It won't take but a minute. It's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever. Our Lady of the Helpless granted her a favor.
Why the bad temper?
So, Ramona!
How in hell does it wind up?
I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.
Why?
Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service.
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
No.
Are you sure it isn't contagious?
You'll soon find out, you liar!
There's been an accident.
Where?
Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
What?
From the terrace.
What are they doing in Los Feliz?
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
You think he's smart?
Think you can do it?
Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.
If I were you, I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel.
Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates.  Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.
Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?
You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!
I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing.  If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.
You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
I don't need a babysitter.
I am the demon from the bottomless pit...
Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
Give me your wrist.
Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...
Real effective security...
You okay?
How's your pulse?
Then shoot him already.
What do we do now?
When you...  What?  I'm busy.
Well, we paid for it, we got the guys on a retainer.
...can we have a white one...?
It's the gratitude of your <u>party</u>, and of your <u>President</u>...
Yeeaahhh...  Ohmigod ... ohmigod... ohmigod...
Look, look, look....  He's fine, as long as he has his medication.
You know, I think you people are looking at this All Wrong.  If you look at the <u>backstory</u> -- the guy's coming back from Combat and Torture.  Of <u>course</u> he is gonna be ... uh ... uh ... "fucked up".  Of <u>Course</u> he's gonna "need a little help"... 
When it broke, he said one word:  get me Ronnie Brean.
It won't hold.
Tell me again.
Lookit, don't worry about it.  It's not a New Concept. Wake me when we touch down, will...
Who's gonna tell'em.
...but...
Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
...what's the Long View?
Eight Days To Go 
I <u>live</u> for midnight, when I can tear another of those suckers off.  Watcha got for me?
And carrying.  The National Flower of Albania, something..... Now Is it some Festival?  Some <u>Harvest</u> Festival, something...
Find out is there <u>any</u> chance we can get some rain tomorrow, <u>will</u> you...?
And I'd like to point out that I've been on prescription <u>medication</u>, the side-effects of which...
He just got Hip to us.  He just ended the War.
Quite touching.
And I take this <u>opportunity</u> to suggest that, equally, I admit to <u>nothing</u>, and that I would like my lawyer present.
ON SCHUMANN, WHO HAS CONE TO THE BACK OF THE COUNTER, AND IS EMPTYING THE CANNISTERS.
OVER A SLEEPING BREAN, STRETCHED OUT ON A POOLCHAIR, GRACE, THE SECRETARY, COMES OUT ON TO THE POOL AREA, HOLDING THE SHOT OF A SMALL, FOREIGN LOOKING CHILD, IN FRONT OF A PILE OF RUBBLE. SHE SHOWS IT TO MOSS.
But, you know, <u>this</u> is the meeting, Ron?  You think about it.  <u>This</u> is the meeting.  This, here.  Schumann and us.  King Kong and the Trainers...this's it... What are you working on?
Would somebody wake me in five minutes?
We're locked into Albania.
What <u>are</u> you interested in? 
I'll play your silly game.
...you the Press Office?
But there isn't a B-2 bomber.
Where'd you go to school, Kid.  Wellesly?
When's he coming back...?
How much...?
If we can hold the break-in-the-dam for ten days, til the election, we...
String a few together.  All I need's eleven,
What do you think would hold it off?
Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight. What does <u>that</u> mean?
Uh, it's a slogan.  From, uh...
That's from the ... it's got to be from the...
"They Got To Know?"  <u>Stan</u>...?  Get with it.  Who Killed Kennedy...?  I read the first draft of the Warren Report, said he was killed by a Drunk <u>Driver</u>.  You watched the Gulf War.  What did you see?  Day after day, the one "Smart Bomb" falling into a building. The <u>truth</u>, I was in the building when they <u>shot</u> that shot, they shot it in a studio, Falls Church Virginia, 1/10th scale model of a building.
Is that true?
Well, no, well, you couldn't <u>tell</u> any...
And get me the Fad King.  No.  Get him First...  We don't need an Act Two?
...we put your Guy in a <u>sweater</u>...
...we get our hands on him?
What's the thing with Morse Code...
...that's right.
Yeah, we'll gettem in their cars.  I'm slowing down...  No, no.  Look, lookit:  I think it's a mistake, well, I'll <u>tell</u> you why:  you got'em by the balls, <u>Squeeze</u>.  Because Schumann's the Shark.  He's ...<u>Jaws</u>.  You have to <u>tease</u>'em... You don't puttem in the first reel of the movie...  Bring'em back <u>slow</u>, the President...  No, no, put him on.  Put him on.  President wants to reveal Scbumann before the election.
...the Albanian Campaign.  And we won't even be a footnote...
 A slight, a slight, well, no, we're gonna <u>deal</u> with it, we just, I need a little readjustment...we need to re<u>think</u>...
Y'know what else bothers me?  "Shh lil baby, don' saya word, papa's gon buy you a mocking bird..."  The baby don'say a word, WHAT THE FUCK IS THE MOTHERFUCKING MOCKING BIRD GONE SAY?  You follow me...?
He's supposed to be flying in from Europe.
Stanley.  Stanley... you knew the... Stanley.  You knew the deal when you signed <u>on</u>.
It's too clean.
Keep Talking....
...what am I <u>doing</u>?  Do you see me working...?  Here's what you want to do, you want to come out of the box, an item, someone 'ready <u>has</u>, but <u>then</u> you sell it to'em.  Torn <u>jeans</u>, uh ... faded Levi Jackets, uh... uh...

She is the victim of, she has been <u>relocated</u>, to, to, for the <u>terrorists</u>, the Government Labs...the, the... a <u>staging</u> area for their Atomic workshop.  They're torturing her family, because they have connections in Canada, which would permit the terrorists access to the American Border.
What the fuck did you <u>mean</u>, "What kind of stuff?"?
Just want to take a nap.
He's not dead, Ronnie.  He's just a little understandab1y, <u>fatigued</u>.  Let's get him to some help...
....beautiful.
Of course, we're gonna need some <u>water</u>, uh...
It's a romantic and tragic drink.
Got a little action there, eh buddy?
Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality...
What's going on?
Sell?
Ah, I had a tough day. Some jerk D.K'd me and I gotta cover his loss.
Coulda been a contender.
Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive, and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm.
...Got a 100 on me, you...
You sure about this FAA announcement?
The FAA announcement.
What brings you out here...
No, what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself.
What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet.
No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.
...this guy who said he was from the Security Exchange Commission, whatever the hell that is, calls and wants to ask me about that stock I bought...
They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
I don't know anything!
What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?
Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another.
...and you don't have to put up a dime, Roger.
So what's the problem?
Jackson, Steinem...
...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know?
Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.
...rings a bell somewhere. So what?
A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities...
Hi sport.
What? How do you know about my father?
Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...
What about hard work?
How much?
Gordon what I want--and I never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this. I want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune!
Now, wait a minute, Dad...
I didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning.
Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.
Gordon, it's two minutes to close. What do you want to do?! Decide.
Upper West Side.
Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...
Bud, I hate to tell you this but you're a genius!  Darien...lightning has struck! The lightbulb has been invented. Edison, Da Vinci, Einstein are watching...
You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...
...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded...
Are you mad! Why are you doing this! We're so close, the town is going to be ours. Don't throw away your future Bud!
Hi.
Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
It's over you, Gordon.
I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.
Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?
You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.
Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie.
Listen, you clowns, there's somebody else out there trying to buy your airline, if you want to be Pac-manned and gobbled by Atilla the Hun be my guest!
Doctor? Lawyer? CHINA Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care.
Yeah, yeah, OK
Us is over.  You had your chance you blew it.
Oh Mark.  It's ok.  It's ok.
Yes, I guess you're right
Your books Master Loftmore
Thank you
No?
A party at a waxwork huh?
They seemed, closing by much 
No Mark. MARK Why not?
I can't believe she went out with that monster last night
Save it for the powder room babe, this man is in pain
You bet.  We all can't be such modern people 
Besides, Dad would have freaked.
Why is he worried?
I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.
That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.
That can't feel good.
I am.
Almost.
What?
Um...sure.
Yeah.
Just plain old coffee.  None of that mocha nonsense.
Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
She never mentioned her father.
I came in from my room...
And there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish.
Good.  I'm good.
Thanks, but I'm fine.
Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
What?
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
Sit down here.
We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur.  What's her first name?
What?
Then what was it?
You don't know that.  If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow you have to break the connection.
But he acted like he'd never heard of it.
Did he say that?
She's awake.
When's she out of here?
Nope.
And we moved out here for the quiet.
Tomorrow.
Did she say that?
But what if something happens?
Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw something.
In the house.  I was scared.
What kind of whispering?
Yep.
Ohmigod.  You'll never believe...I saw Schumway...
He's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so Bob Shine introduces us...
And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, "Doctor Spencer, I am a great admirer of your work..."
You didn't?
Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
Oh.
I don't need a shrink.
He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
You don't remember?
It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.
...I'm positive this time...
...Please stop...
I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
Claire, please don't...
Who?
She did it.
What's that for?
Are you alright...?  You look pale.
No scaredy-cats in the Talamasca, huh...?
Michael, Rowan should -
Always give the crovd a taste, darling.  Now - Ryan said I'm supposed to make sure -
You babbling that nonsense - now...? This is a wedding.
Rowan Mayfair.  Who's calling...?
Yes.    Listen carefully, Rowan. Have your attorney contact me at once. There are matters of immediate -
A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.     Have your lawyer -
I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
I'm tired.  I need to rest.
You're mad!  Your mind is sick!
STOP!
If I could feel like you feel...but I have only others' feelings - . . like breeres that blow through me.  Things to be felt, yes --- but not nine to feel...
But I could understand. I want to understand!
--- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat.
I don't know what you are!!!
Aaron was in the dream.  A dream tilled with spirits.   you killed him, didn't you...?
Let me go...  Michaelllllll...
Harder...
I don't remember you at all-  You - you saved my life-  Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...?
The one time I want it to work...
Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know -
I called Dr. Styles at the Neurological Institute  In L.A., remember...?  He said he'd see you.  He was intrigned.
Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?
Rowan...?
I'll bet she had a wonderful smile.
Their what...?
I've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside!  But I'm on the outside now...  you put me there!
Go home, Stu  I'll call you.
I'm getting --- left behind.
I've got a tenant coming over later - can I take the afternoon off?
That's not technically accurate - SIMPSONS murders weren't sexually motivated.
When could I look round?
So there is only one key...
Hello MRS STECKLER - we haven't seen you for a long time
Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
This must be one of the old keys -
OK, the press call you the WHITE ANGLE because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes, blonde hair...
How long have you been watching me?
And how did it feel to be rid of him
My mother...?  I never knew my real MOTHER - I was adopted
What?
I don't like sugar
I haven't been using it recently LESLIE
I'm sorry, I couldn't - when is she due?
I had an accident - I fell down stairs...
That's good
See? Did you see that?
That's crazy talk.
Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.
What are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight?
Cut it out, before you break something!
Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.
Check this out.  Hurry!
Dead?
I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different.  She wasn't your mother mother--
Get them together.
Ladies first.  I insist.
You have changed since second grade.
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you.
Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
God, you are so hot.
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.
Ted, we put a lot of love in our business.
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
We miss you. We miss our son.
Dad, please.
Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.
I guess.
Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
Whatever helps you cope.
There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...
Hmmm?
They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.
So, what brings you here at his hour?
Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
You're a peach.
He was my Grandfather, too.
Me-ow.
Then I'll write about YOU.
She said peanuts, you cretin.
Considering this is your first time on a private jet, on which you are interviewing the world's most eligible bachelor,  you are extremely cavalier.
Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.
Where are we going?
I doubt it.
I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.
At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
I have to be honest with you, Ted. I really despise "The Girls of Xenia."
I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.
You think you're working with chimps here?
I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.
Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.
Honestly, Merk. It's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire.
We don't allow TIPN, Ted.
There you are, Ted-baby. Everything all right?
You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy.
What kind of ideas?
I can't wait to see the pictures.
People pay good money for that?
That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.
You look pretty.
How soon can we get something?
He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
You mean he withdrew...
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
I've got that two o'clock in town.
Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...
Guess I kind of lost it there.
If you want company...
Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away.  And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal.
He dropped Jimmy off first?
Are you crazy, Ray?
Thank you, Jimmy.
What?
It's those rocks, up there.
Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
I thought we were goin' to a movie.
I wanna live at the beach someday.
No you don't.
I'm here.
Hello.
I love you.  Now give me the line.
Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...
Who is it?
It doesn't look like it.
Davy.
I had to go look for this coupon.
I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?
A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.
Never seen a gun fire so fast!
Know what this is?
Relax.  We're almost there.
So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?
When we find him, he is mine.
My hat is off to you, sir.
Pull the balloon right in front of him!  We'll board the damn thing!
You didn't tell us you had this on!
You must excuse the Doctor.  No one has ever beaten him at his little game.
Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.
Why surely, Mr. President, there must be some mistake.  I mean...
Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that.
Nicely said, sir.
Very good, sir!  I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade.
No, sir... just a businessman.
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
Are you all right?
I beg your pardon?
Well?
Hey...!
Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?
No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life.
Sir!  I have to talk to you.
Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
He's no magician.
Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell.
Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.
Smells like a battle.
And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold.  And keep her diaper changed.
Madmartigan, I need your help.
I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king!
I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.
She said lots of thing.s
Madmartigan!  I can't stand being in closed-in places.
She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
I don't know, Willow.
I could be you rguard!  I could carry your spear!
What do you want!
No!
I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  But what's this got to do with it?
We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!
What's the magician's weapon?
But what am I gonna transform??
Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!
I'm not going in there.
She needs to be changed.
Who is that horrible friend of yours?
Maybe milking.
Milking?
Guess I'm not used to so much.
Who are these orphans, anyway?
I thought I was the English.
You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?
Don't let them hurt you.
How reliable is this kid?
Amish.
Johnny 
Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in 
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
They kid a lot.
Your sister said you don't have a family?
No.
Because  somehow  they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
How long?
Something wrong with buttons?
Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.
Well... the store at Saltzburg...  But you won't be going to Saltzburg for a while.
I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school.
Now hold on. There's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job.
You're so sure of that?
Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position.
Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
John said you're Amish.
I am not a child.
Weird, man. No fuckin' electricity. What do you figure they plug all their shit into?
No, you listen. Get out!
Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
Then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants!
...resourceful!
Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!
Are you all right, Dorothy?
What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
Run, Toto, run!
The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.
No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
Toto, too.
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.
...bed.
Oh -- 
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
Can't that female take no for an answer?
Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything?
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
...don't talk.
Ohhhh --
They would?
Um-hmm.
Yes -- that's true.
But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
It does help.  Dorothy, you're waking up!
Oh -- Oh --
Ah --
Comin' to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
Come on -- I've got another idea.
Here -- here. Go 'way and let us alone!
What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away! 
You don't get around us that easy!
...of the West.
Beautiful!  What an echo!
I'm not afraid of her.  I'll see you get safely to the Wizard now, whether I get a brain or not!  Stuff a mattress with me! Hah!
Then I'm sure to get a brain --
Come on -- come on --
Oh - oh, poor Dorothy!
Hey -- what about Dorothy?
Well --
Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, Ive heard them all.
What is it?
Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
Zukovsky...
Count to twenty.  When you get to twenty open the hatch.  It can only be opened for a few seconds or well sink.
Who told you to look at Elektras files?
I took the initiative.
Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
Then Robert was right about a Russian connection.
I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.
My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. Hes decisive, vigilant.  And he makes an excellent omelette.
Oh my God...were buried alive...
What is it?
No. Youll be safe here.
You knew when you first saw me.  You knew it would be like this.
Valentin Zukovsky.
Bond, Im a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal familys, now its mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?
Whats your business with Elektra King?
A rope!
How appropriate.
Ill send someone out.
Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didnt think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.
So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
Washington?
Wrong answers?
Hi, Jon.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
The missing scientists.
Dont be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We wont even be here, will we?
What if youre wrong??
His what?
Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.
This'd better not be what I think it is.
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
They're practically on us . . .
Dan, is this -- is this New York??
How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
-- What?
Don't rub it in.  I live here.
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
What is this place?
I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.
What do I get out of it?
Is that all?
You did say "Ahab"? You're sure about that?
Thanks.
I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?
Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this time.
Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses.
Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
This guy's kinda dorky lookin'.
Ten is hardly worth the effort. We're talking a lousy million five U.S.
It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?
Where are you going?
No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle- trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking for what's his name. Three X' s.
Miniature power cams set in on contact, giving you a sure grip on any surface.
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.
You're serious?
What's this?
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy 99!
Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.
Easier than that, buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want.
I don't like him being here.
You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.
I'm o.k.  I'm o.k.
Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.
Were you now?
What do you say?
What are you going to do?
If she held on any longer she could have.
A piece.  Only a piece.
Is it enough?
It does indeed, Max.
And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
Oh, shit.
Frederick Frankenstein?
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
No!
They say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the God-fearing people of this village.  What say you to that?
Give him an extra dollar.
MMMmmmm.
MMmmm.
Of course.
You have your tickets?
Yes.
I promise.
Will you miss me?
I will!  Goodbye, darling!
Goodbye, darling.
Darling!?!
Poor Delbruck!  There must be some way to reach him -- to control that body.
Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?
I suppose you're right.
Good night.
I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?
Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.
Wockers with the knockers???
Down!  Get down, you beasts!
Fro-derick!
That's not bad.
Oh!  May I call you 'Master'?
You can say that again.
What's the point of my setup? It's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said.
Yes, Master!
How's it going?
What did you find out?
Bring -- me -- the -- violin!
Is everything ready?
It's the only way.
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmm.
May I see your violin?
Nice!  Nice little balance to it.
Well...
Would you like a sandwich?
What are you going to do?
Why don't we talk inside?
It wouldn't be fair to her.
Yes, I will.
MMMMmmmmm!
No, not sound.
His schwanzstucker.
How long is it so far?
Will you hear "Last Post", Sir?
Could be.  Across the river into Zululand. . They might just be waiting there for us to show up... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies!....
Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross.
Yes. I see you've issued each of them with a Martini Henry Carbine. Our quota for Native contingencies: one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle.
The only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.
I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river
